Rowan Pelling answers your questions about sex

QUESTION: I've been seeing my partner for five months and feel we have a long-term future, so are discussing changing our method of contraception. We've been using condoms, but my boyfriend wants me to go on the Pill. I don't want to go back to it aged 48, when my chances of getting pregnant are almost non-existent. Wouldn't the rhythm method be sufficient?

ANSWER: Now here's an ironic thing: if you were trying to fall pregnant at the age of 48, the medics would tell you that your chances of doing so naturally were rather less than those of being hit by an asteroid.

Suggest, however, that you're thinking of being laidback about contraception because you're far too old to conceive and the story changes dramatically. Everyone will cite a woman they know on the far side of her 40s who stopped bothering with protection and suddenly found herself knocked up.

<START>They might also mention the fact that middle-aged women are the fastest-growing demographic seeking abortions, and that much of what's said about female fertility is wrong.

So, when [Q7371805|I] tell [Unknown1|you] to be cautious, [Q7371805|I] really mean it. If [Unknown1|you]'re going to try the rhythm method, [Unknown1|you] need to be careful monitoring your temperature and ovulation.

[Unknown1|You] also need to be prepared to exercise extreme self-control during fertile periods - which is also when [Unknown1|you]'ll be feeling most desire. Good luck with that.<END>

None of this means that you have to go back on the Pill. There's a wide range of alternatives. The popular Mirena coil releases smaller doses of hormones than the contraceptive Pill and safeguards against pregnancy for five years.

I would advise a trip to your nearest family planning clinic, where a specialist will talk you through all the best options.

Channing Tatum wants his daughter to be just like her mom Jenna Dewan.

The Magic Mike hunk penned a sweet essay for the June issue of Cosmopolitan magazine, where he opened up about his love for his wife and their three-year-old daughter.

'One day, Jenna just blurted out that she knew exactly what she wanted in life and she didn't have to look for it anymore because it was me... I remember feeling this incredible rush - it was the sexiest thing she'd ever done for me,' the 37-year-old wrote.

Speaking about his wife of eight years, Channing says it was her strength and honesty which made him fall for her.

Commentary: Who says public schools need more money?

Editor's note: Ben Chavis is the co-author with Carey Blakely of "Crazy Like A Fox: One Principal's Triumph in the Inner City." Chavis received his doctorate in education and philosophy from the University of Arizona and served as principal of American Indian Public Charter School for seven years. Chavis has also worked as a real estate investor. Currently, he is replicating the model he established at American Indian Public Charter School in various schools throughout the U.S. and Canada.

Educator Ben Chavis says money isn't enough to improve schools run by incompetent administrators.

(CNN) -- Teachers unions and politicians are constantly claiming that K-12 public schools need more money in order to produce good academic results. But does the data support the argument that our schools need more money to succeed?

The Oakland Unified School District had a budget of $602 million for the 2008-2009 school year, according to Katy Murphy, an education reporter with the Oakland Tribune. That budget, which includes $77 million spent on consultants, means that the district spends an average of $16,270 per student!

What have we, the public taxpayers, received for our exceptionally generous financial support of the Oakland public schools? According to the California Department of Education, the district's reported 2008 California Standardized Test scores show:

1. Of 707 eighth- and ninth-graders who took the California Standard test for general math: 1 percent tested advanced, 5 percent tested proficient and 94 percent failed by testing below grade level. See details about K-12 schools, teachers "

2. Of 2,506 ninth- and 10th-grade students who took the California Standards test in algebra: 0 percent tested advanced, 3 percent tested proficient and 97 percent failed the test.

How is it possible for a public school system to so liberally spend more than half a billion dollars and still fail to educate 94 percent or more students of all racial backgrounds? Does anyone believe providing more money to these public school systems will enhance these students' academic performance in mathematics?

During my principalship at American Indian Public Charter School, we spent less than $8,000 per student, proving that schools did not need more money. We served a student population that is on average 98 percent minority, with 97 percent receiving free or reduced-price lunch and many who are non-English speakers and from single-parent families. AIPCS students spend three to four hours a day working on mathematics and English-language arts.

In 2009, they excelled in academics, physical fitness and any standardized test that they were given. The hard work of these students and staff has paid off with virtually all of our eighth-graders testing advanced in algebra, including 100 percent of our eighth-grade black students, Mexican-American students and American Indian students.

Before I became its principal, people called American Indian Public Charter School the zoo. The neighbors hated it. They couldn't stand the behavior of the students, who, with little supervision or control, wreaked havoc in the area.

Unfortunately, the students who decided to attend the school did not receive the academics and structure they so direly needed. The school was in many ways a failure, a joke, a sham.

When I took over as principal in 2000, it was the worst middle school in Oakland. I told the board I would take the job only if they let me go my own way and do what I thought was best. I implemented a golden rule at American Indian Public Charter School for staff, students and families: If you act like a winner, you'll be treated like a winner. If you act like a fool, you'll be treated like a fool. The charter school is now one of the top-scoring schools in the state and is nationally recognized.

The United States spends more money on public education than any other country in the world. Yet, we still have a secondary public education system that ranks with Third World countries in preparing our children in English-language arts, mathematics, science and social studies.

Washington, D.C.; Detroit, Michigan; Los Angeles, California; Kansas City, Missouri; and numerous other cities throughout the United States are producing the same poor academic results at an extraordinary cost to the taxpayer and a tremendous academic loss to our students and country.

I believe all the money in the world would not be enough to improve schools run by incompetent public school administrators. We need proven leaders who can prepare our children to be competitive members in a free-market society.

The American public has been conned into believing that public schools need more money. Have you ever met a public school administrator who said they have enough money?

President Obama is moving in the "right" direction by reforming public schools to be held responsible to the American public in return for more money. It's very clear that most Americans want to ensure that accountability be attached to the stimulus money that is being awarded to all institutions, including public schools.

<START>Next time you hear school officials or [Q82955|politicians] begging for more money, ask them how large the district's budget is and how many [Q48942|students] are enrolled in their district. Then you do the [Q395|math]. After all, it's your money they want to take.

The opinions expressed in this [Q22826122|commentary] are solely those of [Q4885418|Ben Chavis].

Respite for reptiles as demand drops for skins

NEW ORLEANS (AP) - As conspicuous consumption loses some of its cachet during the recession, the swamp's most conspicuous consumers have less to fear from humans.

Instead of taking the half-million alligator eggs from marshes and swamps that they had in recent years, alligator farmers are expected to pull in 30,000 this year, with a final tally in December. And state wildlife officials expect the 2009 harvest of adult gators, which begins Aug. 26, to amount to a small fraction of last year's 35,500.

Nobody's buying, said Rapides Parish nuisance-alligator control officer Ron Guy. He's among more than 60 people around the state who get called if a gator wanders out of its bayou and into a local golf course or backyard. Their pay is the right to sell the skins.

Gators bought Louisiana farmers and hunters $71 million in 2007, modest revenue even at that peak. This year, revenue is expected to be closer to $10 million in 2009, a drop like locals say they've never seen.

"My father was in the fur and alligator business. I started buying fur and alligators when I was 13 years old," said Wayne Sagrera, 65, who has about 75,000 alligators at Vermilion Gator Farm Inc. in Abbeville. "I've seen some slowdowns. But nothing to compare to this."

People who are still buying expensive accessories have shifted away from conspicuous consumption - for instance, Jimmy Choo is selling obvious faux-crocodile as well as the real thing, fashion consultant Robert Burke said.

"There's certainly a sensitivity in the luxury market of anything that is too much luxury, and alligator would fit into that category," Burke said.

His income from hauling off nuisance alligators let Guy leave construction work six years ago, but he's back now - and running out far less often for alligators.

"Instead of going on every call as soon as it comes in, you prioritize them," Guy said. "If it's under a car in the Sonic parking lot, you've got to go."

Demand for crocodilian leather, including the large alligator and crocodile skins used for handbags and the caiman leather used for cowboy boots, dropped more than 40 percent worldwide between the first quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009, according to Choon Heong Koh, executive director of Singapore tannery Heng Long International Ltd.

Demand for small, farmed hides used for watchbands fell even more dramatically - 80 percent or more, he said in an e-mail to The Associated Press.

Luxury watches are "such a high-end item - when those people stop spending money you get real nervous," said Dave Travers, owner of Sebring Custom Tanning in Sebring, Fla.

Even John Price - whose Insta-Gator Ranch and Hatchery in Covington gets 40 percent of its income from tours, including egg-hatching tours that start in mid-August each year - has suffered. He usually raises about 1,500 alligators a year to sell their hides. Instead of collecting 1,500 eggs this year from the wild, he collected 200, largely because people want to hold eggs while they hatch.

"We have customers who have booked the right to hatch an alligator. I don't want to call them back and say, 'Sorry, we're not doing it,'" Price said.

About 30 of those 200 'gators will wind up back in the wild. As part of the program that brought alligators back from the brink of extinction, Louisiana's 59 licensed alligator farmers must return about 15 percent of those they raise to the swamps they came from.

That's about the same share that would survive non-human predators during their first four years in swamps and marshes.

Trolls 'bump shame' Duchess of Cambridge

Cruel internet trolls have 'bump shamed' the Duchess of Cambridge for her lack of pregnancy curves after her first public appearance since announcing her pregnancy.

Kate, 35, attended a reception at Buckingham Palace for World Mental Health Day on Tuesday, after taking six weeks off while she battled hyperemesis gravidarum - a severe form of morning sickness - revealing just a hint of a baby bump.

While many commenters on Kensington Palace's Instagram account complimented Kate on how well she looked, others were eager to point out her tiny stomach with one saying: 'I can't believe she's pregnant, she looks too thin.'

<START>Others even claimed that they look more pregnant than [Q10479|the Duchess] does, questioning how [Q10479|she] can still look so slim.

However, [Q381160|experts] hit back at the comments saying that 'bump shaming' can cause unnecessary [Q154430|anxiety] for mothers-to-be.

[Unknown1|Lesley Gilchrist], practising [Q185196|midwife] and [Q45916492|co-founder] of [Unknown2|My Expert Midwife], said: 'Bump shaming can really damage a woman's body confidence and cause needless worry and [Q154430|anxiety] over the health of their baby.<END>

It's important to remember that the bump size is just the size of the baby's "packaging" and has no bearing on the size of their baby.'

Peggy Osborne, a midwife at The Women's Health Clinic who also teaches NHS antenatal classes added: 'There is a lot of pressure on new mothers to have the perfect bump, especially when you have had to announce it perhaps before you were ready.

'But there is no real use comparing one pregnancy to a previous one, as the embryo could implant differently or eating habits may have changed - especially with hyperemesis.'

Kate is estimated to be less than 20 weeks into her pregnancy, which was announced in August before she reached the crucial 12 week stage.

Peggy added: 'At this stage in the pregnancy the uterus is being pushed higher in to the abdomen but baby is yet to cause any real "bump," typically any additional roundness is just fluid.'

Unlike regular morning sickness, it doesn't fade away with time and can leave some women bedbound as they are unable to keep food or drink down.

It is also considered to be the second leading cause of hospitalisation during pregnancy and can lead to dehydration - dangerous to both the mother and child.

**** ARTICLE #10: 20111109 - Review of Glee, "The First Time" (None) *****
Review of Glee, "The First Time"


Last American virgins: Rachel and Blaine contemplate some, er, character research in "The First Time."

Spoilers for last night's Glee below:

Right up front, let me say that "The First Time" was the best episode, overall, of Glee season three. Before we get to the good stuff, though, we had to get through about fifteen minutes of complete contrivance. So let me gripe about those first, because I'm kind of a jerk that way.

"The First Time" is about sex and virginity, hence the name. And lest we miss that theme, it begins by morphing Artie into an overconfident, pushy director who questions Rachel and Blaine's ability to play Maria and Tony without having become Jets all the way, as it were. (Later, he decides to counsel Coach Beiste, diagnosing her problem with intimacy. Artie, it seems, is now Dr. Drew Pinsky.)

The scene screams of a forced conflict designed to drive the plot: it's as if Artie has become Will, assigning Rachel and Blaine the loss of their virginity by writing SEX on a whiteboard as their weekly project. I don't buy it: I don't buy [1] that Artie would become fixed on this idea (despite the intro about his trying to fake his way through directing by having strong opinions) [2] that Rachel and Blaine would take it to heart ("How are we, as virgins, supposed to follow that?") and [3] two faculty members, however uncomfortable with the topic for their own reasons, would step back while a school musical director urged his stars to have sex for the good of the performance.

The thing is, you don't need a contrived reason to make an episode of Glee about sex and sexual pressure. Here's a perfectly good reason: the show takes place in a high school. Sex as a topic is kind of a given. And once we got past that setup - and that unfortunate Warblers Billy Joel video - this was a really fine episode with some genuine, believable character moments.

Lots of them too, and yet probably the best thing I can say for "First Time" is that it serviced a good half-dozen storylines but did not feel at all crowded. (Though her story got third billing, Dot Jones continued stunning work as Coach Beiste, one of Glee's few characters who can be over-the-top funny and moving at the same time, rather than in alternation.) Kurt and Rachel's respective virginity stories, for instance, were rooted in very real, existing relationship dynamics that needed no dues-ex-Artie to prod them.

In Kurt's case, it was about his wanting to assert his identity as an out gay teen, but also his autonomy to be the kind of gay teen he wants to be: in his case, a sweet, even corny romantic-which itself is a rebellion against highly sexualized teen culture in general (manifest in many things, Glee among them) and against a specific sexualized subculture within the gay community (here represented by seeming Gossip-Girl outtake Sebastian, and the saddest gay bar in Ohio).

This, not any "Will they do it?" debate, was was made his storyline for me: in its own way, his fight with Blaine in the parking lot was as much a statement as his coming out itself. It's his way of asserting that to him, being gay is not simply defined by sex, it's defined by love. And his tete-a-tete with newly-minted bear Karofsky, a nice epilogue to that storyline from last season, built on that: it underscored the point that being gay does not in itself settle your identity, it's simply one more step in figuring out what your identity is ultimately going to be, where you fit in.

<START>[Q1990104|Rachel] and [Q2163539|Finn]'s will-they-won't-they, meanwhile, hung on [Q1990104|Rachel]'s [Q3152967|insecurity] as a [Q713200|performer] - it is a [Q1990104|Rachel] story, after all - but also on their often-unspoken realization that there are forces that may push them apart after graduation. This got brought to a head for [Q2163539|Finn] in [Q2163539|his] disappointment with the [Q7080909|Ohio State] [Q2072298|recruiter]; hearing that [Q2163539|he]'s reached [Q2163539|his] "ceiling" was a harsh and very real moment, and [Q296484|Cory Monteith] really sold [Q2163539|Finn]'s feeling of being helpless and overmatched, unable to keep up with [Q1990104|Rachel] as [Q1990104|she] moves on to bigger things. [Unknown1|I]'m not sure how romantic it is to see them end up in bed essentially as pity sex ([Unknown1|I] half-expected [Q1990104|Rachel] to say, "Now [Q1990104|I]'m doing this for the right reason: Because [Q1990104|I] feel sorry for [Q2163539|you]"). But it rooted the decision in their larger story: it's one way they can be together that's still in their control.

Oh, yeah: [Unknown1|I] guess [Unknown1|I] should say something about the whole plot-about-teens-having-sex business. Um, it's high school? [Unknown1|I] know some people hold stories set in school to a different standard, but [Unknown1|I] have a hard time with the idea that a TV show should (or can) try to influence teenagers" sexual behavior-much less influence it toward never, ever having sex until marriage (or at least graduation).

[Q520766|The episode] said a lot of things about sex, negative and positive, but the bottom line was that it made out first-time sex to be a big deal. That seems about right.<END>

Now a quick hail of bullets:

* I hadn't thought there was much Glee could do to switch up its musical format, but I very much liked the device of using rehearsal performances of West Side songs to comment on the action. I don't know that the series can repeat the device once the musical is over, but I do hope it continues to mix things up.

* Likewise, while there was a certain TV level of production in the musical itself, it was a good move to make the effort to have it sound like an actual high school production in an auditorium, rather than a highly-produced iTunes download.

* "Poison Arrow" is easily my favorite ABC song - from back when I was a young person, before the Great War - so it was a little sad to see it now used as an auditory shorthand for "seedy Ohio nightclub." But I cannot say it was entirely inappropriate.

* I'm not sure if the musical scenes are meant to convey the sense that Santana is currently blowing everyone else in New Directions away, but that's how it looks to me.

* Will and Sue? Did not miss them one bit.

Detractors are calling on the Hasty Pudding troupe to start casting women and to update sexist portrayals of women. Amid the debate, some are calling on Kunis to reconsider her acceptance of the group's Woman of the Year award on Thursday to protest the exclusion.

'It would be a wonderful thing for her to not accept this award, to say this is gender inequality,' said Liz Kantor, a senior studying molecular and cellular biology, who auditioned for this year's show.

'There are women on campus who are more than willing to take advantage of these opportunities, yet they're still being excluded.'

Tickets to the Man of the Year roast honoring Paul Rudd cost $200 - but the price for the Woman of the Year event are just $80.

Hasty Pudding is known for bawdy comedic revues that feature men in drag playing female characters, a longstanding tradition in the group, which says it was formed in 1795.

But more recently, women have sought acting roles in the student-written parodies, which are shown in Massachusetts, New York and Bermuda and have helped launch careers for former students ranging from Jack Lemmon to Broadway composer Larry O'Keefe.

Kantor is among about 20 women who auditioned for this year's show as a form of protest, an idea started by two women in 2015. Each year, the women have promptly been cut.

Women can instead take behind-the-scenes jobs, including writing the shows or working on the technical crew, the group says on its website.

Students on Hasty Pudding's executive board, which is led by a woman and includes several female members, declined to comment. Overall, about half the 50 students involved with the group are women.

<START>[Q1588813|The troupe] has been criticized for [Q1588813|its] all-male cast before, including in a [DATETIME|2016] petition from [QUANTITY|dozens] of former members.

[Q1588813|Its] shows take cues from the [Q692|Shakespearean] era, when men played all roles. [Q13371|Harvard] [Q13371|itself] admitted only male [Q21094885|undergraduates] until a partial merger with [Q49124|Radcliffe College] in [DATETIME|1977].

The [Q5680700|Man] and [Q10294045|[Q10294045|Woman of the Year] award]s precede the kickoff of the annual revue, which includes more than [QUANTITY|30] performances in February and March.<END>

Kunis, whose credits include 'That '70s Show' and 'Black Swan,' has spoken out sharply against sexism in entertainment, including in a 2016 essay. She did not respond to a request for comment.

Some students and alumni have also said this year's Man of the Year, Paul Rudd, should stand up against the exclusion. A message seeking comment was sent to a representative for the actor.

Others recently named Woman of the Year by the group include Octavia Spencer and Amy Poehler, who cracked a biting joke about the group's exclusion of women when she accepted the honor in 2015.

'You know it's time for a change when the Augusta National Golf Club has lapped you in terms of being progressive,' Poehler said, referring to the Georgia club's 2012 decision to admit women.

Some critics are also challenging the portrayal of women in the revues, which have featured characters with names like 'Donna My Knees' and 'Sheila Rowsya.'

'It just magnifies the misogyny that men are portraying these characters,' said Kantor, of West Nyack, New York. 'They're usually just the most blatant stereotypes you could think of.'

Women who have pushed for a place in the cast say students are split. Some say women in drag wouldn't be as funny, and some say the all-male cast is a tradition that should be protected.

Hasty Pudding started as a social club, taking its name from the porridge members brought to meetings. The school recognizes it as a student group but doesn't necessarily endorse its views, a school spokesman said. Officials declined to comment on its casting policies.

But the administration has been working to curb groups that exclude members based on gender, including secretive all-male groups known as 'final clubs.'

Students who join single-gender social groups, for example, are banned from campus leadership positions, but Hasty Pudding is considered an arts group, not a social group, and isn't subject to the rule.

Emily Ratajkowski shows off her washboard abs in crop tee

It may be winter in the U.S., but it's swimsuit season all year around for Emily Ratajkowski.

The 26-year-old's washboard abs were on full view as she perkily posed in a white crop T-shirt and red thong bikini bottoms on Friday.

The stunning model gave a sultry stare into the camera while posing up a storm.

The Blurred Lines vixen has understandably never been afraid of showing off her flawless figure on Instagram, and her social media offerings this week included a flirty dancing video and a Botticelli inspired snap.

Standing completely naked, she mimicked the goddess of love, beauty, sex and fertility from the Italian master's famous Birth Of Venus painting.

Like the seashell surfing deity, strategically placed hair and hands helped preserve her modesty.

<START>[Q5372335|The actress], who has often posted images of [Q5372335|herself] of the steamier variety, discussed online photos with [Q237875|Naomi Wolf] in [Q654606|Harper's Bazaar] in [DATETIME|2016].

'A [Q12068677|selfie] is a sort of interesting way to reclaim the gaze, right?' said [Q5372335|Emily]. 'You're looking at yourself and taking a photo while looking at everyone.'

[Q12068677|She] explained: 'When [Q12068677|I] post a [Q12068677|selfie] and someone comments: "Oh, sure, go ahead and reclaim your sexuality, I got my rocks off," that's not [Q12068677|my] problem.'<END>

In Harper's, for which she posed nude on horseback, Emily praised social media as 'a format where you can be so direct with an audience'.

She said: 'Social media is something women didn't have ten years ago, and that's a big aspect in feminism today. I don't have to be filtered by anyone. I choose.'

Exhibitionism is not Emily's only motive; the swimwear she so frequently models is from her own line.

JustGiving waived fee on Claire Squires' page but does it really need to take 8% from a £10 donation?

By Andrew Oxlade for the Daily Mail


When the huge public reaction to the death of marathon runner Claire Squires became apparent, the reaction from JustGiving, which hosted her fundraising, should have been automatic: it should waive the substantial fee that it creams off donations.

But it was only late last Tuesday morning that the "for-profit" company said the charge would not be applied - after an email from us and the start of a backlash on their own homepage blog, which was urging people to donate.

This evening, Claire's fundraising total had hit £910,000, or £1.1million including the gift aid top-up from taxpayers.

JustGiving says it charges 5 per cent but this is applied after gift aid so the £55,000 it would have made works out as more than 6 per cent of public donations. On top of this, there's a 1.3 per cent credit card charge.

Consider if you donated £10 by credit card. The amount is topped up to £12.50 because of gift aid. The 5 per cent fee is applied - 63p - then 1.3 per cent credit card charge on the £10 - 13p - taking the total to 76p.

This means fees account for 7.6 per cent of the original £10 donation

Some of the people I've spoken to this week, on social media and in person, don't realise there is a fee at all.

It's hardly surprising. There's no mention of it on the homepage and only a small reference way down at the foot of each giving page, which most donors are unlikely to see.

JustGiving pioneered this method of online giving a decade ago but now it's the supine encumbent, surpassed by far cheaper rivals, such as Virginmoneygiving.com, Bmycharity.com and Charitygiving.co.uk.

Virgin Money, which is not-for-profit, only charges 2 per cent on donations and not on gift aid, and Bmycharity.com applies no commission, just a flat charge on card payments.

They also charge the charities a lower fee than JustGiving just to register to accept donations. [Read the story on Justgiving and its cheaper rivals].

<START>It's big business for [Q6316819|JustGiving]. Consider that the [Q578794|London Marathon] raises more than £[QUANTITY|50million] a year. [Q6316819|JustGiving] will account for a large chunk of that each year - and take [QUANTITY|5] per cent.

[Q6316819|JustGiving] claims [Q6316819|its] revenues help to hone the process of giving and help [Q6316819|it] make more money for charities. [Q6316819|It] claims to have raised £[QUANTITY|770million] since [DATETIME|2000], which should mean earnings of £[QUANTITY|38.5million] for [Q6316819|the company]. [Q6316819|It] insists £[QUANTITY|14million] has been 're-invested in technology alone'.

Presumably after the staff are paid - there's [QUANTITY|72] of them - there's potential for decent profits.<END>

To be fair, innovation should be encouraged and rewarded when it contributes to the common good.

But for the sake of transparency the company should declare its cut of each donation during the actual payment process and publish its annual profits on the website. And just maybe it should take a little less.

Taylor Swift's new song disses famous ex-boyfriends

She's already lashed out at the likes of Katy Perry, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West on the first revenge-themed track from her new album.

But it appears absolutely nobody is safe from Taylor Swift's razor-sharp lyrics, as she seems to take aim at her impressive roster of famous ex-boyfriends in her new song Ready For It?

The sassy songstress uses the peppy new love anthem to lavish current boyfriend Joe Alwyn with praise, while not-so-subtly appearing to diss former lovers such as Tom Hiddleston and Calvin Harris.

Scroll down for video

Taylor, 27, has released the second track from new album, reputation, and sleuthing fans have already started decoding the lyrics to work out just who Taylor is singing about.

Her lyrics include: 'Knew he was a killer, first time that I saw him, wonder how many girls he had left haunted.'

She goes on: 'Some boys are tryin' too hard. He don't try at all though. Younger than my exes but he act like such a man so I see nothing better, I keep him forever.'

Fans immediately assumed Taylor was singing about actor boyfriend Joe, 26, who is younger than previous loves Tom, 36, and Calvin, 33, and made his movie debut as a solider in the 2016 film Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk.

The superstar then seems to allude to her past doomed romances with Tom, Calvin and the likes of Harry Styles, 23 and Jake Gyllenhaal, 26, by purring: 'Every love I've known in comparison is a failure, I forget their names now. I'm so very tame now. Never be the same now.'

Meanwhile, others have asked if Taylor is poking fun at her serial dater reputation with the lyrics: 'Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me, stealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry.'

To an ebullient tune, the chorus blares that 'In the middle of the night, in my dreams, you should see the things we do, baby. In the middle of the night, in my dreams, I know I'm gonna be with you.'

Taylor has been quietly dating Joe since last year, choosing to keep their romance away from the limelight, which means if Ready For It? was penned about Joe, it's the first time she's publicly acknowledged the relationship.

Some fans have wondered whether the song title, Ready For It?, is directed at Joe, asking if he's ready for the attention that comes with dating the pop princess.

The song was released amid claims Taylor has filed paperwork to trademark phrases and lyrics connected with her new reputation album, including the line from Look What You Made Me Do, 'The old Taylor can't come to the phone right now. Why? Because she's dead.'

<START>According to [Q2630118|TMZ], [Q26876|the award-winning singer-songwriter] has also trademarked song titles from [Q26876|her] [Q37814092|[Q37814092|reputation] album] so [Q26876|she] can use the lyrics and titles on official merchandise.

Meanwhile, a minute-long snippet of [Q38552445|Ready For It?] debuted during the [Q4705216|Alabama] versus [Q5461626|Florida State] [Q41323|football] game on [DATETIME|Saturday], before [Q26876|Taylor] released [Q38552445|the entire track] to [Q866|YouTube] on [DATETIME|Sunday].

In stark contrast to [Q37912621|Look What You Made Me Do], [Q38552445|the peppy new anthem] struck a far more upbeat note, with [Q26876|Taylor] singing of love and romance.<END>

Both Taylor and ESPN shared a clip of the track with fans on social media, which was the background music for scenes of the two football teams prepared to hit the field.

The video featured scenes of cheerleaders, fans, football players, and seemed to herald a major shift from Look What You Made Me Do.

'Are you ready for it?' Taylor sings in the pop country song. 'Baby let the games begin.'

Twitter was ablaze with fan reaction, including YouTube personality Raphael Gomes, who wrote: 'oh my good i am shooketh, #readyforit sounds like red meets 1989 meets look what you made me do, it sounds magical'.

Another fan wrote a tweet in which his response to the song snippet was a GIF of Jim Parsons' The Big Bang Theory character Sheldon hyperventilating into a paper bag.

As some eagle-eyed fans noticed, Taylor had hinted at this single on August 24, in an Instagram post promoting Look What You Made Me Do.

She'd written: '...ready for it? New single #LookWhatYouMadeMeDo out now. Pre-order #reputation (link in bio) and find out about tickets and merch at taylorswift.com'.

The whole song will be the opener on reputation, according toPeople.

Despite the fact Look What You Made Me Do proclaimed the 'old Taylor' was 'dead,' Ready For It? appears to be a return to form - a country-tinged, peppy love song.

Look What You Made Me Do, on the other hand, had been a score-settling number aimed at those 'I don't like.'

She lashed out at betrayals: 'You asked me for a place to sleep, / Locked me out, and threw a feast,' and appeared to dredge up her on-off feud with Kanye West in the line: 'I don't like your tilted stage,' Kanye having performed on tilted stages on tour.

The lyrics insisted that 'I got smarter. I got harder in the nick of time,' and that 'Honey, I rose up from the dead. I do it all the time.'

She warned: 'I've got a list of names, and yours is in red underlined.'

When that song's music video debuted at Sunday's MTV Video Music Awards, fans were treated to a smorgasbord of references to her old beefs.

At one point, she looks strikingly like Katy Perry while crashing a car and emerging from the wreck brandishing a Grammy Award.

Katy's infamously a 13-time Grammy nominee and a zero-time winner, whilst Taylor's won a grand total of 10 Grammy Awards herself.

In the most scathing dig of the video, she lounges in a bathtub full of jewelry, possibly in reference to Kim Kardashian's robbery last October in Paris.

The robbers had bound her at gunpoint and flung her into the bathtub of her suite at the Hôtel de Pourtalès, making off with millions of dollars worth of her jewelry.

At one point, whilst sitting in the bathtub in the music video, Taylor even mimes firing off a gun.

Kim had involved herself in Taylor's feud with Kanye last year, after which Taylor accused the couple of 'character assassination,' so it's interesting that the bathtub bit of the music video sees Taylor gripe about 'How you laugh when you lie.'

Old flames get a going over too, including Tom Hiddleston, who was notoriously photographed during their relationship in a tank top reading: 'I [heart] T.S.'

Taylor appears in the video with male backup dancers wearing stilettos, hose and crop tops that have got that same inscription.

By the end of the video, there's a row of Taylors - each dressed to represent a different one of her past personae - and they all begin sniping at one another.

One, for example, is the gawky Taylor of the You Belong With Me video, and another's wearing the gown she wore to the 2009 VMAs, at which Kanye had interrupted her acceptance speech to shower praise on Beyonce.

The dorky, perpetually thrilled You Belong With Me Taylor is hectored by one of the others: 'You can't possibly be that surprised all the time.'

When VMA Taylor expresses a desire 'to be excluded from this narrative' - a phrase she'd used last summer vis-à-vis the Kimye feud - all the others scream: 'SHUT UP!'

Crystal Palace want new contract for Yohan Cabaye

Crystal Palace midfielder Yohan Cabaye has less than half-a-year on deal

Club want to secure him as he is now free to discuss terms with other clubs

Eagles deal likely to be one-year contract with option of additional year

By Kieran Gill for MailOnline


Crystal Palace want to tie Yohan Cabaye down to a new short-term deal with less than half a year left on the midfielder's contract.

Manager Roy Hodgson has been impressed with 32-year-old Cabaye, who has made 18 starts in the Premier League this season.

Cabaye was signed in 2015 from Paris Saint-Germain for a then club-record fee of £10million that brought the midfielder back to the Premier League.

Should Cabaye decide to stay at Selhurst Park, it would likely be a one-year contract with the option of an additional year, Sportsmail understands.

Palace are in a race against time to come to an agreement. Cabaye is now free to speak to other clubs ahead of the expiration of his contract.

Since Hodgson came in, the former Newcastle man has been trusted with a creative midfield role.

The Eagles have clawed their way back from relegation trouble and lie in the safety of mid-table.

Next up for Cabaye and Co is a trip to the Emirates to take on Arsenal on Saturday.

Collingwood confirm Daniel Wells to miss opener

Collingwood have ruled out high-profile recruit Daniel Wells for their round-one AFL clash with the Western Bulldogs.

The former North Melbourne midfielder has had calf muscle problems and did not play in any of the Magpies' pre-season matches.

Sidelined: Daniel Wells.

While Wells is one of the league's most talented midfielders, he was a high-risk recruit because he is 31 and has a history of leg injuries.

"Last week we said that we would reassess every seven days, and we are pleased with the way that he is progressing," football chief Geoff Walsh said.

"He is starting to get some good conditioning into his legs, but he won't make round one.

"We are all aware of that, but having said that, we are really pleased that he is going forward and he is starting to feel good, particularly in relation to his calf.

"As he gets better and as he builds training, that will tell us when he is ready to resume."

The news is better for a host of Wells' new teammates.

"Levi Greenwood will train on Friday ... he had some hamstring tightness, but we expect him to roll out on Friday," Walsh said.

<START>"It means [DATETIME|Friday] will be the biggest session of [DATETIME|the week] and we expect [Q6535420|him] to train then, as will [Q7437027|Scott Pendlebury] ([Q223172|achilles]).

Kasem's show featured long-distance dedications

The dedications flowed in from around the world

He took his role as storyteller seriously

(CNN) -- "Keep your feet on the ground, and keep reaching for the stars."

That signature sign-off of Casey Kasem's was recalled by fans of his syndicated weekend radio show "American Top 40" Sunday after the legendary disc jockey died at the age of 82. Kasem began that show in 1970 and hosted it and variations of it until finally ending his radio career in 2009.

But for more than just those encouraging words, Kasem will be remembered for helping to elevate the radio disc jockey gig to one of storyteller and observer of the human condition.

Fans would write in to his show for "long-distance dedications" -- requesting a song for a loved one, a friend or a personal connection far away. In his smooth baritone voice, Kasem would begin "Dear Casey" and proceed to tell tales that ranged from heartbreaking to inspirational.

The dedications poured in from around the world. In 1986, Kasem read a dedication request from a woman in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, who wanted to honor her sister who -- despite suffering paralysis -- was studying for her master's degree in the United States.

"I'm so proud of her, not only for her achievements, but proud of her will and toughness and of her stubborn determination to pick up the pieces and start all over again when most of us would break down and quit," Kasem read. "Casey, could you kindly play 'Broken Wings' for my sister Ayesha at Oklahoma State University? I do hope she's listening, for this is a message from those who love her, all the way from home here in Malaysia."

Kasem got personal after the death of Beatle John Lennon. The DJ offered up moving words in 1980 after Lennon was gunned down near his New York City apartment by Mark David Chapman.

"But John died having discovered who he was," Kasem said. "John Lennon, husband to Yoko, father to Sean [Lennon's young son with wife Yoko Ono]."

The role of music orator was one Kasem took very seriously.

"It's so simple: what do people love?" Kasem said to the New York Times in a 1999 article. "Plato said it best. 'People who tell the stories rule society.' And we tell the stories, and people love to hear the stories. Of course, we've got tremendous responsibility to become accurate with those stories. And in most cases to be wholesome."

On Sunday, the "AT40" website posted a tribute to Kasem. The site for the program, now hosted by Ryan Seacrest, included audio clips of Kasem on the show throughout the years.

UK's 'reckless' Cameron pays political price for Syria vote loss

By Andrew Osborn

<START>
[Q84|LONDON] ([Q130879|Reuters]) - [Q14211|British Prime Minister] [Q192|David Cameron]'s failure to win parliamentary backing for military action against [Q858|Syria] has hurt [Q192|him] politically, polls showed on [DATETIME|Monday], with most [Q842438|Britons] thinking [Q192|him] "reckless" and support for [Q192|his] party falling.

A [Q5150446|Comres]/[Q220072|ITV] poll showed that [QUANTITY|59] percent of those asked thought [Q192|he] had been reckless to organize last [DATETIME|Thursday]'s vote on military action without knowing whether [Q192|he] had [Q4175034|lawmakers]' backing.

Another poll showed the opposition [Q9630|Labour party] had increased [Q9630|its] lead over [Q192|Cameron]'s ruling [Q9626|Conservatives] to [QUANTITY|10] from [QUANTITY|four] percentage points after the parliamentary defeat, setting back [Q192|his] hopes of being re-elected in [DATETIME|2015].<END>

"The ten point lead is larger than we have seen of late, suggesting at least some impact from the Syria vote," YouGov, the second poll's organizer, said on Monday.

Britain's lower house of parliament voted against Cameron's Syrian plans by 285 to 272 votes on Thursday, inflicting a shock defeat on him even though he had already made big concessions to try to win approval.

It had long been clear that most Britons opposed their country being involved in military action against Syria and did not agree with Cameron, but Monday's polls suggest they think he badly mismanaged the overall situation too.

Cameron's office has ruled out a re-run of the Syria vote despite pressure from some senior lawmakers to do so, saying that "parliament has spoken" with ministers keen to blame Labour for sabotaging the vote, an accusation Labour dismisses.

Commentators say both parties want to avoid a repeat. In Cameron's case, losing another vote on Syria could trigger a leadership challenge against him, something that a significant minority in his fractious party would welcome.

Many politicians and commentators have also expressed fears that Cameron's defeat could damage Britain's 'special relationship' with the United States given that President Barack Obama had asked for and not got British military support.

However, another poll showed most Britons did not share that fear. The survey, by the BBC, showed that 72 percent of those asked did not think UK-U.S. ties would be harmed, and two thirds of respondents would not care if they were.

Piers Morgan: JK Rowling's Trump slur proves her hypocrisy

JK Rowling hates Donald Trump.

I don't just mean she dislikes him intensely, I mean she loathes him with a raw, visceral fury.

The billionaire Harry Potter author broadcasts this fact on a daily basis to her 11 million followers on Twitter.

Barely an hour goes by without Ms Rowling publicly attacking, mocking, sneering at and generally abusing Trump.

Of course, that is entirely her prerogative and she is far from alone in this regard.

A lot of people, including many left-wing celebrities like her, feel the exact same way about the 45th President of the United States.

Politics is a passionate business. It inflames people.

And no politician in the history of Planet Earth inflames people quite as much as Donald J. Trump.

Scroll down for video

On Friday, a video was posted on Twitter by Ansel Herz, deputy communications director for Democrat Rep. Pramila Jayapal.

It showed Trump appearing to avoid shaking hands with a disabled child before leaving a White House function.

"Child in wheelchair reaches up twice to shake the president's hand," was Herz's simple but devastating caption.

"If you're disgusted by this," he added, "follow my boss: @RepJayapal. People call her "the anti-Trump." "

Disgust duly followed.

The short video clip went viral within minutes, sparking horror and rage around the world.

Keith Olbermann, infamous left-wing political commentator who now hosts a Trump-bashing GQ webshow "The Resistance," led the charge, re-tweeting Herz's video clip with the words: "About Trump, this is mortifying, revelatory. OTOH, I'm somebody who shook his damnable hand. The child is fortunate he didn't touch the evil."

For JK Rowling, this was the moment she had long been waiting for.

Here, right before our very eyes, was actual visible proof that Trump really is a barbaric, callous monster as she keeps saying.

She hit her laptop faster than Usain Bolt hits his stride.

First, Rowling retweeted Herz's tweet alongside a quote she had located from legendary civil rights activist Maya Angelou that read: "When someone shows you who they are, believe them."

In other words, THIS was the real Donald Trump: a merciless man who would deliberately ignore a young disabled child reaching up to shake his hand.

Seconds later, she tweeted again: "Trump imitated a disabled reporter. Now he pretends not to see a child in a wheelchair, as though frightened he may catch his condition."

Wow.

No room for ambiguity there.

Rowling was very clear: Trump knew the disabled child was there and snubbed him because he was worried about being infected with whatever disease the boy may have.

Tweets No3 and No4 came together, fast and furious: "This monster of narcissism values only himself and his pale reflections. The disabled, minorities, transgender people, the poor, women... (unless related to him by ties of blood, and therefore his creations) are treated with contempt, because they do not resemble Trump."

Then, in tweet No5, Rowling got personal, invoking the spirit of her mother who died in 1990.

"My mother used a wheelchair. I witnessed people uncomfortable around her disability, but if they had a shred of decency they got over it."

Tweet No6 explained this was why Rowling felt SO enraged: "So, yes, that clip of Trump looking deliberately over a disabled child's head, ignoring his outstretched hand, has touched me on the raw."

Again, she left no room for any doubt. Trump hadn't accidentally snubbed the boy, he had done it "deliberately."

Tweet No7 clarified why this was so vile: "That man occupies the most powerful office in the free world and his daily outrages against civilised norms are having a corrosive effect."

And then, in Tweet No8, JK Rowling reached peak anger: "How stunning," she wrote, "and how horrible, that Trump cannot bring himself to shake the hand of a small boy who only wanted to touch the President."

By this stage, it would be hard not to share Rowling's uncontrollable rage - right? I suspect most of her 11.4 million Twitter followers would certainly have felt that way.

They trust Rowling.

As she never ceases to remind us from her high moral plinth, she is the very beacon of honesty, decency and fairness in a world increasingly blighted by Trump-related lies, indecency and unfairness.

She, like Rep. Jayapal, is the "anti-Trump."

She is someone who would never snub a disabled boy.

There's just one problem: it was all a lie.

Trump didn't snub the boy. In fact he did the complete opposite.

The full video of this incident emerged several hours after Rowling tweeted.

It shows Trump heading directly to the boy the moment he entered the room.

He greets him before he greets anyone else.

Then the President crouches down, touches the boy and talks just to him for a few more seconds before moving on.

It turns out that Trump spent more time with the boy in the wheelchair than any other guest - displaying all the compassion and empathy he had been accused of failing to display.

By the time this longer video appeared, the original edited clip was everywhere, gleefully fuelled by high profile liberals.

Chelsea Clinton, who has 1.8 million followers, seized on Rowling's tweets, re-tweeting both the Maya Angelou quote and clip, and the one about how "stunning and horrible" it was that Trump snubbed the boy.

As Sir Winston Churchill once said: "A lie gets halfway round the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on."

Ansel Herz, once he saw the full video, immediately removed his tweets.

"Deleted because it turned out to missing some context," he said. "Apologies."

<START>Missing some context? [Unknown1|You] can say that again, buddy.

Let's be very clear: [Unknown1|you] made the whole world think [Q22686|Trump] hates disabled kids.

Now, at this point, some [QUANTITY|five] hours after [Q34660|her] vicious tweet-storm, [Q34660|JK Rowling] started to be bombarded with demands to delete [Q34660|her] own tweets and apologise. [Unknown2|I] tweeted [Q34660|her] [Unknown2|myself] to say: "What's stunning and horrible is how [Q34660|you] lied to viciously smear [Q22686|Trump]. Delete these lies."<END>

She didn't respond, to anybody.

The world's most aggressively self-righteous tweeter went unusually silent.

A whole day went by.

Then another.

Finally, more than 48 hours later, Rowling came back on Twitter yesterday.

But not, it transpired, to delete the tweets that she now knew were 100% wrong.

No, instead she wished to rant about some deeply offensive comments made by an Irish newspaper columnist.

"This filth was published in the Sunday Times," she seethed. "Let that sink in for a moment."

I didn't have much time to let it sink in before the newspaper concerned deleted the column, profusely apologised and fired the journalist who wrote it.

Yet, incredibly, indignant Rowling saw no inconsistency in allowing her own deeply offensive tweets about Trump and the disabled boy to remain on her feed.

Even the boy's mother pleaded with her to remove the tweets.

"Ummm," said Marjorie Kelly Weer in a Facebook post, "if someone can please get a message to JK Rowling. Trump didn't snub my son & Monty wasn't even trying to shake his hand (1. He's 3 and hand shaking is not his thing. 2. He was showing off his newly acquired secret service patch). Thanks."

But this too fell on deaf, or stubborn ears.

Last December, in yet another rant about Trump, JK Rowling made her feelings crystal clear about people who don't apologise for getting things wrong.

She did so by tweeting this quote from the 17th century French writer Francois de la Rochefoucauld: "No people are more frequently wrong than those who will not admit they are wrong."

It has now been three days since JK Rowling posted a pack of lies about Donald Trump to her 11 million followers.

She knows it was wrong. We all know it was wrong.

Yet, as I write, she still refuses to delete the tweets, correct her lies, or apologise.

Even if she does so now, perhaps after reading this column, the damage has been done.

By contrast, everyone else I have mentioned did remove their tweets once they realised the truth.

Herz deleted, Olbermann deleted and Chelsea Clinton, when I brought it to her attention yesterday, also deleted.

Rowling, however, would prefer to continue using a three-year-old disabled boy to falsely smear Donald Trump, such is her blind hatred for the man.

By doing so, she is telling her millions of young impressionable Potter fans that it's absolutely fine to lie and never correct or apologise for a lie - after spending the past two years telling them that Trump is disgusting because he lies and never corrects or apologises for his lies.

This makes her a shameful, disgraceful hypocrite.

Nobody should believe a word this self-appointed High Priestess of Honesty ever says again, about anything.

The Center for Radiation Therapy of Beverly Hills Earns ACR-ASTRO Accreditation

BEVERLY HILLS, Calif., March 2, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- The Center for Radiation Therapy of Beverly Hills, a state-of-the-art cancer treatment center serving cancer patients in the Los Angeles area, has been awarded a three-year term of accreditation in radiation oncology as the result of a recent review by the American College of Radiology (ACR) and The American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO).

Radiation oncology (radiation therapy) is the careful use of high-energy radiation to treat cancer. A radiation oncologist may use radiation to cure cancer or to relieve a cancer patient's pain.

The ACR-ASTRO seal of accreditation represents the highest level of quality and patient safety. It is awarded only to facilities meeting specific practice guidelines and technical standards developed by ACR and ASTRO after a peer-review evaluation by board-certified radiation oncologists and medical physicists who are experts in the field.

Patient care and treatment, patient safety, personnel qualifications, adequacy of facility equipment, quality control procedures, and quality assurance programs are assessed in the review process. The findings are reported to the ACR-ASTRO Committee on Radiation Oncology Accreditation, which subsequently provides the practice with a comprehensive report it can use for continuous practice improvement.

The Center for Radiation Therapy of Beverly Hills, part of the Tower Hematology Oncology Medical Group, voluntarily underwent the rigorous review process to ensure the practice meets nationally accepted standards of care as determined by ACR. It is the first free-standing radiation center in California, and only the second radiation facility of any kind in the Los Angeles area, to earn the accreditation.

"We are honored to receive this prestigious accreditation, which acknowledges that the center's medical personnel are well qualified, through education and certification, to administer radiation therapy treatments," said Christopher M. Rose, M.D., Medical Director of The Center for Radiation Therapy of Beverly Hills and Chief Technology Officer of Valley Radiotherapy Associates. "We look forward to continuing to offer patients the most effective and up-to-date treatment options, and providing care that meets the highest quality standards."

Barry Rosenbloom, M.D., Managing Partner of the Tower Hematology Oncology Medical Group, said the accreditation reflects the entire group's commitment to safety and unsurpassed patient care.

"Earning the ACR-ASTRO accreditation ensures our patients that they will receive appropriate treatment from skilled medical professionals using superbly maintained equipment, in a facility that meets the most demanding professional benchmarks for safety and quality assurance," Dr. Rosenbloom asserted.

The ACR is a national professional organization serving more than 34,000 diagnostic and interventional radiologists, radiation oncologists, nuclear medicine physicians, and medical physicists, with programs focusing on the practice of medical imaging and radiation oncology and the delivery of comprehensive health care services. ASTRO is a professional organization serving more than 10,000 radiation oncologists, medical physicists, and other health care professionals involved in the treatment of cancer patients.

Hasbro's $120 robo-dog teaches kids to code

It's the pet every parent dreams of - a dog that doesn't make a mess and teaches kids a life skill.

Hasbro has unveiled a robotic dog called Proto Max that educates kids on the basics of coding by letting them program its personality.

There are also 10 activation points on the robo-dog's body, which kids assign reactions to and the app is equip with a remote control so users can drive it around.


Hasbro unveiled a $120 coding toy for children ages six and older.

Called Proto Max, kids use an app to customize its personality.

It comes in eight pieces out of the box and is programmed with 400 sounds and 100 eye animations.

There are three personalities to choose from - small, medium and big - and these options determine the dog's 'general temperament'.

The 10 different activation points trigger different behaviors that users can customize, the points include the ears, nose, tail and two sensors in the patch of fur on its back.

The robot dog was unveiled at the New York Toy Fair this weekend and is part of the FurReal Friends line, reports Cherlynn Low with Engadget.

Hasbro is offering the coding toy for $120, which is geared towards children ages six and older.

<START>[Unknown1|Proto Max] is specifically designed to teach your youngster how to code and comes with a downloadable free app for both [Q48493|iOS] and [Q94|Android].

And there is a dial on the side of its face that lets kids adjust the pitch of Proto Max's voice and how it reacts to stimuli.

The 10 different activation points trigger different behaviors that users can customize, the points include the ears, nose, tail and two sensors in the patch of fur on its back.

Kids can set the robot to respond to interactions by 'dragging and dropping reactions to slots on an in-app diagram of the robot,' reports Engadget.

Proto Max's housing is mostly transparent, as it allows kids to see the inner workings of the robot.

Its eyes consist of 2.6-inch LCD screens and speakers are placed around the machine.

And kids can play fun games with Max such as feeding the robot and playing fetch.

G4S contract to run sexual assault referral centres damned

G4S, the controversial private security company, is to run services providing medical examinations and counselling for victims of rape and sexual assault in the West Midlands.

The company has been awarded a three-year contract to take over two sexual assault referral centres (Sarcs) in Birmingham and Walsall. The national network of 33 centres across England which have developed over the past decade also allow rape and sexual assault victims to report attacks without going to the police first.

The decision to award the contract for such sensitive services to the company, despite widespread criticism over its failings in the Olympics security contract, was made by local NHS commissioners who have recently taken over responsibility for the network of Sarcs from the police.

Union leaders and violence against women campaigners sharply criticised the "sell-off" of such sensitive services to a private company with such a chequered record.

<START>[Unknown1|Karen Jennings], [Q3547264|Unison]'s [Unknown2|assistant general secretary], said: "It is shocking that a private, profit-making company with such a chequered record should be put in charge of these highly sensitive and intimate support services. A woman at her most vulnerable must be treated with the ultimate respect, dignity and sensitivity by trained [Q1391344|professionals] who she feels confident about placing her trust in," [Unknown1|she] said.

"The police service has developed over the years experience and expertise in working with women at such difficult times. They have well-established links with supportive services and agencies and that progress should not be undermined by selling these services off."

[Q7293878|Rape Crisis (England and Wales)] said victims of sexual violence need to access long-term support and counselling as well as immediate medical and legal help: "[Q7293878|Our] concern is that commissioning generic private contractors such as [Q1322045|G4S] to run Sarcs will lead to a focus on cost-efficiency above the needs of sexual violence victims and, in particular, that crucial long-term support services will be sacrificed in the name of cost-cutting."<END>

The decision to give G4S the contract appears to follow complaints that the existing centre in the West Midlands had failed to meet official minimum standards for at least four years.

G4S Forensic and Medical Services is already involved in providing similar services in Essex, Worcester and Telford. Women "crisis workers" staff the centres, assist with medical assessment and provide advice on follow-up services. G4S also provides women-only call handlers for dedicated phone lines for victims who contact Sarcs in Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire, Wiltshire and Hertfordshire. It also provides a specialist service for child victims of sexual abuse in Devon.

The company has recently advertised for "female crisis workers" to work at Sarcs at £12.50 an hour and to be on call on a 24/7 rota.

In response to the criticism, Gary Green, managing director of G4S Forensic and Medical Services, said it has been working in this area since 2005 and had developed substantial expertise in providing a high standard of care while helping the police protect the evidence they need to secure a conviction: "Our dedicated medical staff come from a range of backgrounds in health and social care and are absolutely committed to looking after the needs of the victim at what can be a very traumatic time. That's why we work with the local health services and the police to ensure that in the centres we manage, we have specially trained advocates focused solely on the welfare of those who come forward to report rape or sexual assault."

At the launch of the West Midlands G4S contracts earlier this week, Chief Superintendent Simon Hyde, the West Midlands police's head of public protection, said: "Research and evidence stresses how important it is for victims to be able to access skilled, experienced forensic medical practitioners as part of the service, and that a high ratio of these physicians should be female.

"We wanted to bring the focus back on the service we provide to victims and have ensured that we have consulted with our partners and voluntary agencies to ensure the facilities provided through the NHS give the highest standards of victim care and treatment."

Did Your Favorite Flicks Make the 2018 National Film Registry List?

The 2018 inductees into the National Film Registry represent microcosms of American history and not necessarily the best films in cinematic history. Each year the Library of Congress adds 25 more films that must be at least 10 years old, in order to "safeguard" American-made films.

National Public Radio reported Wednesday that the announced selections should mirror American culture as "compositions of consequence."

Diverse genres, length and style of film comprise the 25 the Library of Congress selected, such as Jurassic Park (1993), Disney's 1950 classic Cinderella, Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain (2005), the Rex Harrison-Audrey Hepburn musical My Fair Lady (1964), Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca (1940), Field of Dreams (1989), the Generation X favorite The Goonies (1985) and The Shining (1980), the Stanley Kubrick horror flick starring Jack Nicholson.

Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden said: "These cinematic treasures must be protected because they document our history, culture, hopes and dreams."

Selection criteria for the registry focus on "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant" films. Historically, the National Film Registry includes American company-produced films, "typically for theatrical release or recognized as a film through film festivals or film awards," reads the Library of Congress website. The purpose is to "safeguard" U.S. films.

The registry originated in 1989, when some of the first films chosen included undeniably classic The Wizard of Oz (1939), Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958), Singing in the Rain (1952), On the Waterfront with Marlon Brando (1954), Star Wars (1977) and a slew of Academy Award winning movies.

The new crop boasts a broader selection, including a short film, Hair Piece: A Film for Nappy Headed People (1984) and Smoke Signals (1998), the first-ever Native American-written, directed, co-produced and acted movie.

In a democratic show of hands, the Library of Congress gleans ongoing nominations from the public. To glimpse a list of suggested movies - listed by year - that you may want to nominate for next year's list, the library posts an online nomination form.

"Please do vote," reads the page. "Films that receive the most support each year are given special consideration during the process by members of the National Film Preservation Board."

That means that films released in 2009 are now eligible for consideration, ranging back to 1890. If you have a special fondness for Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel, Angels and Demons, Fantastic Mr. Fox, Julie and Julia, The Hangover, Monsters vs. Aliens or any preceding year's film, now is your chance to vote - up to 50 times per year.

Here's the full list of the 2018 additions:

Inside the lavish lifestyle of lotto winner scammer Baron

From slugging packages to people's doorsteps to cruising in a $200,000 BMW convertible, 'lotto rat' Gary Baron appears to have had no problem adjusting a life of luxury after winning a $16.6 million group Powerball.

While his colleagues and lotto syndicate members kept their day jobs, the 50-year-old former Victorian Toll courier splashed his newfound cash on a $600,000 home for himself and two more houses for his children, according to The Courier Mail.

He then went on to purchase the extravagant BMW convertible and a car for his kids, while entertaining the idea of a jet ski and new phones.

Mr Baron won $16.6 million in a $50 million Powerball in 2014, but claimed he had purchased the winning ticket with his own money - not funds from a workplace lotto syndicate at Toll's North Geelong depot he managed.

14 of Mr Baron's co-workers and syndicate members sued him for their share of the money, claiming he used their funds to buy the ticket before taking off with the cash and not telling them.

A settlement was reached on Wednesday between Mr Baron and the group, but it is unknown how much they will each be paid out.

The 50-year-old reportedly called in sick to work before resigning.

In the days following, Tattersalls revealed in a press release a Victorian man - reportedly Mr Baron - had won $16.6 million.

'I'm still in disbelief ... I don't need that amount of money, it's too much for me,' the man told officials.

'I'm going to share the prize money with my family. I'll make sure it doesn't change who I am but I'll definitely be able to live a better lifestyle, with a few more toys.

'I love being out on the water so I'll buy myself a boat and a jet ski, and my kids have been wanting the new iPhone 6 so they can have that now and I might spoil them each with a new car,' the anonymous man said.

Mr Baron was in charge of collecting $20 from each syndicate member to purchase lottery tickets on behalf of the group, according to a writ filed last year.

There was an understanding any winnings would be split equally between all members.

Members of the Syndicate, who said they were friends with Baron, told A Current Affair they questioned him about his recent lavish purchases.

'I said "you haven't pulled off the Powerball and haven't told us or anything have ya?" and he just goes "nah, nah" and he just laughed and walked away,' one of men in the syndicate said.

'Winning Tatts lotto is like, everybody dreams of it, that it only happened to the lucky few once in a while, this was our shot, and it's gone - he took it away from us.'

The 14 syndicate members only learned the truth about Baron's newfound wealth after one of his Toll colleagues delivered him a congratulatory bottle of champagne from Tattslotto.

<START>The civil trial ended on [DATETIME|the same day] it began in the [Q4109092|Victorian Supreme Court] on [DATETIME|Wednesday]. It was expected to carry on for [QUANTITY|five] days.

'Things have changed a bit,' [Q16729644|[Q56060731|[Q16533|Justice]] [Q16729644|Kim Hargrave]] said after [Q17131110|counsel] for the group suing [Unknown1|Mr Baron] advised [Q4109092|the court] the case had been resolved.

It is understood each of the members wanted around $[QUANTITY|1 million] in a pay-out but may get less than a quarter of that, according to [Q4656226|A Current Affair].

Media celebrates Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's life, legacy

Across television and streaming services, the life and legacy of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was already front and center Saturday, a day after her death at 87. A look at coverage and plans in her honor:

Looking back on the film that spotlighted Ginsburg worldwide, and offered intimate insight for young people, one of the CNN executives who shepherded the 2018 release pointed to the justice's cultural relevance.

"We greenlit the film because of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's extraordinary legacy in equal rights and her stature within our national culture," Amy Entelis, executive vice president for talent and content development for CNN Worldwide, told The Associated Press in an email Saturday.

<START>"We never expected [Q42048168|the film] to generate the reaction that [Q42048168|it] did. Many people were unfamiliar with [Q11116|her] pre-judicial career as a [Q40348|lawyer] for the [Q21637|ACLU] and how [Q11116|she] played such an essential role in securing equal rights, particularly for women, which meant all [Q846570|Americans] benefited," [Q58416693|she] wrote. "The stories of [Q11116|her] personal struggle to become an [Q40348|attorney] makes [Q11116|her] singular contributions to the law that much more poignant. And [Q11116|her] enduring marriage to [Q6775247|Martin Ginsburg] touched and moved audiences of all genders and generations."

This [Q15994987|CNN Films] [Q93204|documentary] will be broadcast on [Q48340|CNN] [DATETIME|Saturday night at 10 p.m. ET], with encores [DATETIME|Sunday at 10 p.m.] and [DATETIME|2 a.m. Eastern]. [Q42048168|The film] is also available via [Q48340|CNN] on demand with cable and satellite subscriptions beginning [DATETIME|Sunday], and for streaming via [Q21503813|CNNgo] platforms, also beginning [DATETIME|Sunday] until [DATETIME|Sept. 26].

[Q42048168|The documentary] is also available for streaming on [Q1630304|Hulu], [Q270285|Apple TV] and for rent on [Q4740856|Amazon Prime Video] and in the [Q9593|[Q9589|iTunes] store].<END>

Time magazine will feature Ginsburg on one of multiple special covers for an October double issue presenting the 2020 Time 100 list of the world's most influential people. It will include a special tribute to the justice, who was featured on the list in 2015.

The issues will be available on newsstands in the U.S. beginning Sept. 25.

The 2018 bio-drama focusing on Ginsburg's law school years and early legal career is available for purchase on Amazon Prime Video and in the iTunes store.

Felicity Jones, who portrayed the young law student and fighter for justice, told the AP in an email Saturday that Ginsburg was a beacon.

"Ruth Bader Ginsburg gave us hope, a public figure who stood for integrity and justice - a responsibility she did not wear lightly," she wrote. "She will be missed not only as a beacon of light in these difficult times but for her razor sharp wit and extraordinary humanity. She taught us all so much. I will miss her deeply."

Other distribution plans for the movie were pending Saturday.

Tributes and re-broadcasts are trending on streaming services and the apps of major networks, with more to come.

Plans for "CBS Sunday Morning," beginning at 9 a.m. Eastern, include journalist Erin Moriarty looking back on the life and times of the judge. Rita Braver, who covered Ginsburg, will offer an appreciation. John Dickerson of "60 Minutes" will report on the political implications of her death and "60 Minutes" correspondent Bill Whitaker will have a tribute at the end of the Sunday night broadcast.

At NBC, the news division and those of its other networks are already out with special reports. On MSNBC, a past profile, "Justice Ginsburg," was re-broadcast as word of her death spread, with plans to show it again Saturday night.

Charlie Sheen hints he knows Hollywood stars with HIV

He publicly announced that he was living with HIV in November 2015.

And Charlie Sheen now claims that there are people in Hollywood who are secretly living with the same disease.

'I know who they are, but I will take that to my grave,' the 51-year-old actor told The Kyle & Jackie 'O' Show on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, the actor also claims the 'miracle drug' used to treat the virus actually makes him 'safer' than most people when it comes to sex.

'Here's the absolute freaking irony - with the miracle drug that I'm on, this PRO-140, I am actually safer than most cats out there that profess to be on the tallest tree,' he said earlier in the interview.

'I will take that to my grave': The 51-year-old actor made the claims during an interview with The Kyle & Jackie 'O' Show on Wednesday

The Anger Management actor exclusively opened up to Daily Mail Online in December about the clinical trial drug used in his treatment.

Charlie has been involved in a clinical trial for the drug called PRO-140 since early 2016.

As opposed to traditional antiretroviral therapy (ART), which involves taking daily medication, Charlie receives a weekly injection that has no side effects.

<START>In [DATETIME|December], [Q103939|he] received the news from the head of his clinical trial that he has achieved complete suppression of [Q15787|the virus] using this method alone.

During his previous appearance on the [Q1582014|KIIS FM] radio show, [Q103939|Charlie], who once openly bragged about his 'polygamy' lifestyle, admits [Q103939|his] sex life is now non-existent due to health woes.<END>

'... Here's the joke these days right, a friend of mine says 'hey man how's your sex life?' and I'm like 'oh it's just f---ing perfect because HIV is such a great pickup line!" he told the show's hosts.

When asked whether he's still sexually active he replied: 'not anymore' and added that his sex life suffered instantly after his shocking health revelation.

There's nothing better than a pamper day at home to get you ready for the week ahead.

Thanks to Asda's new Sacred Spa range (from £3, Asda stores), DIY indulgence has never been better value.

The collection includes Epsom salts, body lotion, salt scrubs, body polish and body butters, all in a choice of two scents - Invigorating Sea Minerals or Jojoba and White Jasmine.

They are beautifully presented in colourful packaging, which looks far more expensive than it actually is.


It's a new year - which means there's a new colour to wear. Pantone has declared Ultra Violet the shade of 2018, so expect to see it on make-up counters in everything from eyeliner to lipstick.

<START>If that feels a step too far, try a [Q428124|violet] [Q36864|nail] polish. [Unknown1|Nailberry]'s [Unknown2|L'Oxygene Polish in Extravagant] (£[QUANTITY|14.50], nailberry.co.uk) ensures [Q36864|nails] won't dry out, or for a deeper shade, try [Unknown3|YSL La Laque Couture Nail Polish in Violet Baroque] (£[QUANTITY|19.50], yslbeauty.co.uk).

So it's nice to hear she loves a multi-tasking bargain just as much as the rest of us. Her must-have travel product is a bottle of Tea Tree Oil.

A natural antiseptic, it can be used to heal blemishes, inhaled with steam to treat a cold and even as a hand sanitiser. Try Thursday Plantation Tea Tree Oil (£9.99, Boots).


It's always tempting to relax in a long, hot bath - especially on a day like today. But it is not such good news for your complexion. Hot water strips the natural oils and moisture from your skin, leaving it parched, dry and even scaly. This can also lead to more wrinkles, as drier skin tends to crease more readily.

Try to resist using water that is too hot, and limit baths or showers to 15 minutes tops. Most importantly, make sure you add a moisturising product to the water.

Bramley Bubble Bath (£12, bramley products.co.uk) contains geranium and lavender, with sweet orange essential oils. It's gentle and gets to work hydrating the skin while you relax.


If you feel like your complexion needs extra help to counteract overindulgence and revive dull skin (who doesn't at this time of year) Chanel's new palette is your secret weapon.

The Palette Essentielle (£52, chanel.com) contains a blush, a concealer and a highlighter in natural, complementary colours to hide blemishes and give cheeks a glow.


In your 50s: Perfect for brightening under the eyes, Rimmel Wake Me Up Concealer (£6.49, Boots) can also be used on pigmentation. Pat over your foundation with the applicator and blend with your finger.

In your 60s: MUA Cover and Conceal Wand (£1.50, Superdrug) should be used before applying foundation for long-lasting coverage. It works particularly well on thread veins or dark under-eye shadows.

In your 70s: Available in 12 shades, NYX Studio Photogenic Wand Concealer (£6, Debenhams) works for most skin tones. It brightens and camouflages and even comes in a green shade to neutralise redness.


January is when our immune systems most need a boost to ward off coughs and colds.

Echinacea has been shown to aid the body's defence against germs and now - thanks to Fresh cosmetics - the immune boosting plant extract can benefit our skin, too.

The Fresh Creme Ancienne Ultimate Nourishing Honey Mask (£116 John Lewis) uses echinacea to detoxify, and pure honey to help seal in moisture, soften skin and improve elasticity.

Apply to dampened face, leave on for 10 minutes, then rinse as normal. It feels very rich, but not sticky. A pricey, but worth it, New Year treat.

Woman claims Kate Duchess of Cambridge revealed unborn baby is a girl

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have announced they are expecting their first baby.

SHE'S usually so good at keeping secrets. But the famously discreet Duchess of Cambridge may have dropped her guard a little on a walkabout.

According to one member of the crowd, Kate, who is five months pregnant, appeared to hint she might be having a baby girl.

Sandra Cook 67, was among the 2,000 wellwishers who greeted the Duchess on her visit to Grimsby.

"The lady next to me gave her a teddy bear and I distinctly heard her say 'Thank you, I will take that for my d....'," she told the Daily Mail.

"Then she stopped herself. I leant over and said to her: 'You were going to say daughter, weren't you?' She said: "No, we don't know!" I said: 'Oh, I think you do' to which she replied: "We're not telling!"

"I have been here since 10am and it was worth every cold minute of the wait to see her. She is just beautiful and so lovely and friendly."

Diana Burton, 41, who gave Kate the teddy, was too shell-shocked to recall the conversation.But Mrs Cook, who works in a local charity shop and lives in Grimsby, was adamant about what she heard.

"I only hope that she doesn't now give birth to a boy or I'm going to look pretty stupid," she said.

"But she definitely said 'd------'."

St James's Palace did not comment on the matter, although royal sources insisted the couple had not yet found out the sex of the baby, which is due in July.

There was more baby talk and plenty of gifts for Kate as she went on a ten-minute walkabout outside the National Fishing Heritage Centre.

One admirer, Bobbie Brown, 42, asked Kate whether she had felt the baby kicking yet.

"She said: 'Yes it is, very much so'," she said.

<START>Although [Q179406|it] is still one of the largest centres for [Q152|fish] processing in [Q145|Britain], [Q179406|Grimsby] has been in decline since [DATETIME|the 1950s] and youth unemployment is among the highest in [Q145|the country].

Unfortunately [Q10479|the Duchess]'s arrival was almost [QUANTITY|90] minutes late after [Q10479|her] helicopter was delayed by thick fog.

Royal [Q483501|artist] [Q2947141|Paul Emsley] explains the new [Q134307|portrait] of [Q10479|The Duchess of Cambridge]<END>

She had been due to be collected from Kensington Palace by the Queen's helicopter, known as the Royal Fight, at 10am in time for a 11.35am start. The flight is paid for by taxpayers and will cost around £3,500.

But dignitaries and flag-waving wellwishers were left shivering in the cold as her pilot waited for a break in the weather.

Many grumbled that the foggy conditions had been known about well in advance and asked why Kate had not simply taken the train, a three-and-a-half hour journey which costs £42.50 each way.

A St James's Palace spokesman said: "A number of factors are taken into consideration when deciding on transport, including cost, practicality and security arrangements and what the member of the Royal Family is doing before and after the engagement."

At a later visit to the Humberside Fire and Rescue Service, Claire Moss-Smith, 86, a patient at a local hospice told the Duchess: "I'm waiting for you to be Queen."

Kate replied with a smile: "You might be waiting for a long time."

Bill Shorten and the chamber of petulance

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten in Parliament on Wednesday.

Photo: Alex Ellinghausen

If puerile nastiness entertains you, or watching adults behave like petulant adolescents, then Federal Parliament was the show to watch this week. Anyone who witnessed question time, especially from inside the chamber, would have seen small-mindedness triumphant. If Australia is suffering from a failure of political leadership, causing a loss of business confidence and investment, then that failure is clearly bi-partisan.

With a precipitous decline in revenue as the price of all our major energy exports have plunged, and the Senate serving as a chamber where budget cuts go to die, Australia has a real challenge in finding new sources of revenue and new ways of curbing spending. The government has made efforts, and most of them have been rebuffed in the Senate and rejected by the public. New measures are needed. The time for posturing is over.

If Australia is suffering from a failure of political leadership, causing a loss of business confidence and investment, then that failure is clearly bi-partisan.

Yet this is what the alternate leader of the nation, Bill Shorten had to offer on the first day of Parliament in 2015:

Question one: "Given that nearly half of his parliamentary colleagues, including two-thirds of his Liberal backbenchers, have today expressed a lack of confidence in the Prime Minister, how can the Prime Minister claim to have a mandate from this country?"

Advertisement

Two: "Is the Prime Minister planning to abandon any of his budget measures? Or is he just planning to abandon his Treasurer, as he did at the press conference today?"

Three: "I refer to the Liberal member for Brisbane's perceptive comments yesterday: We cannot govern ourselves in an internal climate of fear and intimidation. And that is the unacceptable situation we have endured for the past five years. Does the Prime Minister agree with the member for Brisbane?"

Four: "My question is to the Minister for Communications [Malcolm Turnbull]. Minister, why are you still on the front bench?"

The answers were (question one) no; (question two) yes; (question three) no; (question four) because I'm not a treacherous back-stabber who helped bring down both leaders I have served under.

<START>[Q4910865|Mr Shorten] then moved a no-confidence motion in [Q348577|the Prime Minister], yet devoted much of [Q4910865|his] energy to a gratuitous personal attack on [Q927550|Turnbull]: "[Q927550|He], the [Q226822|Zorro] of the dispatch box, has said that [Q927550|he] wants [Q319145|the job] but [Q927550|he] will not fight for [Q319145|the job]. [Q927550|He] is prepared to injure [Q348577|[Q927550|his] [Q319145|Prime Minister]] but [Q927550|he] leaves [Q927550|his] supporters hanging. [Q927550|He] is a veritable ball of ambivalence!"

And so on. [Q4910865|Shorten] will not be remembered for [Q4910865|his] wit.

[DATETIME|This week] was an opportunity for [Q4910865|him] to display that [Q4910865|he] was a better man than [Q348577|the Prime Minister], that [Q4910865|he] was more than a vindictive point-scorer, that [Q4910865|he] had policies to address [Q408|the nation]'s drift into debt and deficit. [Q4910865|He] did not take that opportunity. [Q4910865|He] missed it completely.<END>

Then there were the voyeurs of the opposition, the members waving goodbye to the Prime Minister and Treasurer Joe Hockey. They were led from the front row by Jenny Macklin, who, you would think, would know better, having reached her 60s and been in parliament for 19 years. Nineteen years in which six Labor leaders were deposed in eight leadership changes, with all but Paul Keating departing at the behest of their own colleagues (Kim Beazley, Simon Crean, Mark Latham, Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard).

The Dummy-Spit Award for the most childish member of the house was a tie between Pat Conroy and Nick Champion, both former union officials and both serial brats. Labor breeds haters. It is famous for that. Even the most colourless in its ranks, like Macklin, can revel in pettiness.

Observing all this was the omnipresent, non-partisan political editor of Sky News, David Speers, who, after noting the bilious gloating of the opposition, also noted that karma had come back to bite the Prime Minister. He pointed out that Abbott had baited Gillard with some similarly goading questions after she had suffered political near-death at the hands of her colleagues.

Karma is also repaying Abbott for his ingloriously unwise comment that "the adults are back in charge."

Tuesday was more of the same. Shorten's first question: "If good government starts today, what on earth has the Prime Minister been doing for the past 521 days?"

In summary, the second sitting day of 2015 was almost identical to the first. Unedifying.

Wednesday, however, was different. Shorten asked a series of constructive, penetrating questions. Perhaps feedback had come back that he had gone too far, been too nasty, too petty, and his gloating had been bad optics.

Dorner's 'last stand' after hiding in plain sight

13 February 2013 Last updated at 19:47 By Alastair Leithead BBC News, Big Bear Lake

Thick snow still blankets the small ski town of Big Bear Lake after a weekend storm which had hindered the search for Christopher Dorner.

<START>A massive manhunt led [Q578478|sheriffs] here [DATETIME|last week] after [Q4419912|the 33-year-old]'s truck was found burning on a mountain road.

The authorities went from house to house in the snow, looking for [Q4419912|the ex-policeman] who was suspected of double murder and of killing a former colleague while on the run.

They used snow cat vehicles to scour the area for any sign of [Q4419912|the 270lb (122kg) African American], who was not thought to have had any winter survival training.<END>

'Heartbroken'

The ex-Navy reservist and former police officer was heavily armed. As the trail appeared to go cold, there was speculation that someone else was involved - or that the burning car was a decoy.

Security was stepped up across southern California and there were long delays at the US-Mexico border as every vehicle was searched.

But it appears he was hiding out in one of the hundreds of mountain cabins in the centre of town - just half a mile from the police control centre.

"We haven't had so much excitement around here in 20 years since that armed bank robbery," one local said, getting a coffee as this tourist city 7,000ft (2,133m) up in the mountains could finally relax.

Ron White, from Big Bear Donuts, said the locals weren't afraid: "He was targeting police, not us."

Footage has emerged of the gunfight which took place at the cabin

The mayor of Big Bear Lake had said he was more worried that anyone who saw Dorner might have taken the law into their own hands.

"We are certainly very relieved that residents and tourists are now safe," Mayor Jay Obernolte told the BBC as police were still trying to identify the charred remains found in the burned-out cabin.

"But we are also heartbroken that we lost a sheriff's deputy. Our thoughts go out to his family."

He praised the action of the law enforcement agencies.

When asked how they could have missed the suspect in their search, he explained many of the cabins are holiday homes, locked up and left empty. Police could not just smash down every single door.

Who started fire?

But when Dorner decided to make a run for it back down the mountain and stole a car, the alarm was quickly raised and police were soon in pursuit.

There was an intense gunfight as he tried to escape from a mountain lodge he had barricaded himself into, no doubt aware from his military training that he would be surrounded.

The mountain roads were sealed off as dozens of police, FBI agents, sheriffs and snipers moved in.

Journalists followed the operation as it unfolded by listening into police radios.

From the recordings, since posted online, it appeared the police may have started the fire, which soon overwhelmed the wooden building.

As the lodge burned and there were mixed reports about whether or not a body had been found in the building, the authorities appeared pretty confident they had got their man.

At an Italian restaurant in Big Bear, staff and diners were relieved to hear the manhunt was finally over.

It might be a stereotype but when they said "it's such a calm place - nothing like that ever happens here," it seemed accurate in this laidback mountain town.

'Ghost town'

"A lot of citizens were worried," one diner told me. "As soon as people heard what was going on, this place was like a ghost town."

It's peak ski season and there's a great combination of California sunshine and well-covered slopes - the bars and restaurants are normally heaving.

On Wednesday morning police were still blocking roads approaching the valley where the manhunt had come to an end.

The news helicopters buzzing overhead showed there was little left of the lodge but burned timbers.

It could be some time before forensic scientists can confirm the body is Dorner, but the manhunt is over.

Life here and down the mountain in Los Angeles, is getting back to normal.

Most of the protection teams deployed to guard dozens of potential targets of the former cop's grudge have returned to normal duty - LAPD is no longer on high alert.

Efforts now will switch to establishing what drove this disgruntled former employee to go on a deadly rampage as some form of revenge.

Human rights activists criticise Egyptian president's state visit to France

Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi is in France for talks on terrorism, the Libyan conflict and other regional issues amid heavy criticism over the Egyptian leader's crackdown on dissent.

The Egyptian head of state has overseen a large crackdown on critics, jailing thousands of Islamists along with pro-democracy activists.

Over 20 human rights groups denounced France's strategic partnership with Egypt as the country "is abusively using counter-terrorist legislation to eradicate the legitimate work in favour of human rights and suppress all peaceful dissent in the country." They called for a demonstration on Tuesday near the National Assembly in Paris.

<START>[Q307871|El-Sissi] has said that [Q307871|his] tough rule has ensured stability, pointing to war and destruction in [Q858|Syria], [Q805|Yemen] and [Q1016|Libya] as the alternative.

At a press conference with [Q3052772|[Q191954|French President] [Q3052772|Emmanuel Macron]], [Q307871|el-Sissi] said: "You cannot present the state of [Q79|Egypt], with all that [Q79|it] has done for [Q79|its] people and for stability in the region, with [Q79|it] being a dictatorship."

[Q79|He] said that religious values were more important than human values.<END>

Macron said he had discussed the question of human rights with the Egyptian leader.

French authorities see Egypt as a key country in efforts to stabilise the troubled region, and Macron has warned that in the absence of Western support, Egypt could turn to the West's authoritarian rivals China and Russia.

Tennis champion Serena Williams has had a thinly veiled dig at her rival Maria Sharapova.

Sharapova, 30, was banned from professional tennis for 15 months for taking the banned drug meldonium.

But Williams, 35, wrote in an open letter on the chat website Reddit: "It has been said that I use drugs.

'No, I have always had far too much integrity to behave dishonestly in order to gain an advantage."

The American 39-time Grand Slam winner, who never mentions her Russian rival by name, adds in the post: "I've been called man because I appeared outwardly strong.

"It has been said I don't belong in women's sports, that I belong in men's because I look stronger than many other women do.

"No, I just work hard and I was born with this badass body and proud of it."

In her new memoir Sharapova describes being intimidated by Williams" "thick arms and thick legs."

Turkey protests pose a new threat to Syria peace efforts

Europeans are worried Turkey's controversial handling of protests over a minor urban development in Istanbul is damaging the whole EU-NATO peacemaking and security project in Syria.

ISTANBUL, Turkey, June 7 (UPI) -- Europeans are worried Turkey's handling of protests over a minor urban development in Istanbul is damaging the whole EU-NATO peacemaking and security project in Syria.

Turkey has staked its reputation as a non-partisan, non-Arab arbiter of disputes and flare-ups in its neighborhood and as the modern inheritor of the mantle of the old Ottoman Empire.

Arabs tolerated Turkey's role as a mediator and facilitator despite strong reservations about Ottoman rule over their lands before independence or creation of modern Arab states, preferring it to British and French mandates.

But Turkey bared new ambitions during the turmoil in Iraq after the 2003 allied invasion that brought down Saddam Hussein and more recently in Syria, both former colonies of its Ottoman predecessors.

As Syria plunged deeper into strife and thousands of Syrians sought refuge in southeastern Turkey, Ankara could convincingly argue it had a stake in Syria's future.

Europe saw Turkey as a valuable rear guard as it tried to shield itself from political and security fallout from Syria. As the Syrian conflict threatened to spill over into Turkey along with the fleeing multitudes, European defense commanders promptly sent and installed Patriot missile batteries along Turkey's Syrian border.

But it all appeared to be going wrong as Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, riding high approval ratings amid what Turks saw as their country's resurgence as a regional power, began to implement a long-cherished Islamization of the country's deeply entrenched secular society.

Last month authorities began shutting down establishments that served alcohol or what Erdogan aides saw as the lewd westernization of society. With his popularity on the rise, Erdogan easily silenced critics who saw his measures as an attempt to recast Turkey after his own Islamist model.

Turks in general are not against some Islamic elements marking day-to-day pursuits and lifestyle that link them to their heritage and tradition, but most draw a line at what they see as going beyond "moderation" -- a term open to heated debate over the decades since Kemal Ataturk ushered in the republic in 1922.

Erdogan is adamant that forces inimical to his rule rather than Turkish masses turned the Istanbul protests into a movement increasingly questioning his legitimacy.

He also shocked European partners by insisting his handling of the protests was mild compared to what EU partners would have done in similar circumstances.

European criticism of Erdogan has been sharp but cautiously coded.

The protests have also demonstrated that, through years of exposure to mainland Europe and yearning for Turkey's eventual entry into the club of nations, Turks are more Europeanized than the ruling party's ideologues.

Most Turks see the government's conduct as indicative of its eastward push rather than a westward reach to Europe and democratic values enshrined in EU rules for letting new members in.

Turkey has been vying for EU entry since 2005 but lags behind almost everyone being considered as part of EU enlargement. The eight new potential entrants are Albania, Bosnia, Croatia, Iceland, Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey.

EU Enlargement Minister Stefan Fuele, who was in Istanbul for talks, delivered a public reproach.

<START>"Peaceful demonstrations constitute a legitimate way for groups to express their views in a democratic society," [Q370164|Fuele] said.

"Excessive use of force by police against these demonstrations has no place in such a [Q7174|democracy]."

The widely publicized chastisement was music to the ears of [Q39259|Erdogan]'s many foes on the right, left and center of [Q43|Turkey]'s volatile political spectrum. The civil strife complicates [Q43|Turkey]'s overt support for [Q858|Syria]'s armed opposition, based in [Q406|Istanbul], and a dangerous balancing act with eastern [Q12223|Kurdish] factions known to have strong links with armed groups in [Q858|Syria], [Q796|Iraq] and [Q794|Iran].<END>

Turkey is a major player in international peacemaking efforts now under way in Syria, involving negotiators from the EU, the United Nations, Russia, the United States and the Arab world.

Erdogan has banked on continued popularity, a robust economy and a strong power base within the political establishment, but his response to the protests threatens to change all that.

Istanbul and the southwestern tourism belt were the worst hit after the protests, with hotels reporting mass cancellations. Turkey's service sector provides the bulk of the national earnings -- up to 63 percent according to latest data.

As the sixth most popular tourism destination in the world, Turkey drew 31 million tourists in 2011. This week the Turkish stock market was reeling under the impact of the protests. Analysts predicted job losses in the service sector, a potent new flashpoint.

A viral debate has broken out on Twitter after one user shared a 'guide' that shows the different levels a marshmallow can be toasted.

Twitter user Yashar Ali shared a photo that showed marshmallows that had been toasted to different degrees ranging from one to ten to the social media platform on Sunday, July 7.

And since the image was shared, over 3,000 users have shared their opinions on the what the perfect toasted marshmallow should look like, causing a now viral debate.

The New York-based Twitter user shared the image alongside a caption that read: 'Five or six are correct.'

On the scale in the image, marshmallows ascended in order from least to most toasted, and were numbered from one to ten.

The marshmallow labelled 'one' appeared to not have been toasted, while the tenth sweet on the scale was more or less burned.

Over 3,000 users have commented on the now viral tweet, revealing what they regard as the perfect level of burned.

'It's eight or nothing. Five or six? Are you serious?' one Twitter user said.

Another said that 'eight is the only acceptable answer', while a different user wrote: 'I'd go up to 7. That one looks nice n gooey on the inside.'

<START>'Really anything from [QUANTITY|four] to [QUANTITY|seven] is acceptable. But [QUANTITY|five] is ideal,' one man said.

Meanwhile, [Unknown1|a mother-of-[QUANTITY|two]] wrote: 'As an ex-[Unknown2|Girl Scout] and mom who spends every summer at [Unknown3|Boy Scout] camp with [Unknown1|my] [QUANTITY|two] sons: You need a [QUANTITY|7] or [QUANTITY|8] on that marshmallow char scale to achieve the internal molten gooey-ness to make a proper [Q2339814|S'more]...'

Similarly [Unknown4|another user], who said [Unknown4|she] was once a [Unknown2|Girl Scout], said: '[QUANTITY|Eight] is perfect. Most needs to be toasted with a slight burned area. [Unknown4|I] was a [Unknown2|Girl Scout].'<END>

Some others shared stronger opinions on the topic of toasting marshmallows, as one woman said: 'Anyone who chooses one-six must have some real issues in their lives......or they could be diagnosed with ADHD.'

'Always disturbed me, the people who set their marshmallows on fire. Like damn, be patient,' another said.

Meanwhile, one user shared a small 'guide' of their own, as he jokingly detailed what he believes is the meaning behind each marshmallow.

'One-two is a waste of a stick. Three-four is what you give the kids who really want one but are doing what their told.

'Five-six is good seven-eight is being thankful it didn't turn into... nine-ten is a waste of a stick, do not eat that trash,' he added.

Another said: 'Dude, no. If you can still see white, it ain't right.

'You should have to blow it out after admiring its torch-like qualities. You gotta hear that shishing [sic] sizzle.'

Other users were in total disagreement with the chart. One said: 'There's a massive spectrum between seven-nine that is not fully explored in this image.'

Another jokingly said: 'Which number is the one where your marshmallow catches on fire, then you wave the stick back and forth to put it out, and the flaming treat slips off, flies through the night air, and sticks to your friend's leg, causing third degree burns?'

'The only correct answer is zero. Graham cracker and chocolate, and NO marshmallow!' one woman said.

Former ballerina says pressure fuelled her eating disorder

A former ballerina has described how the pressure to be 'lean' led her to develop an eating disorder that nearly ended her life.

Anais Garcia, from Baltimore, Maryland, told how she starved herself in a desperate bid to please dance teachers who favoured 'taller and thinner' students.

At the height of her sickness she weighed just 80lbs (5.7st) and was told by doctors that if she danced again her heart would stop.

<START>Now [Unknown1|the 20-year-old] is recovering from the illness and is determined to help other [Q805221|dancers] struggling with body image and eating disorders.

[Unknown1|Anais], who majored in dance at a performing arts high school, said staff and [Q48282|students] placed a 'huge emphasis' on body type.

'You wear skin tight leotards and tights in front of full length mirrors for hours each day,' [Unknown1|she] said. '[Unknown1|I] was constantly told to change [Unknown1|my] body, specifically to develop longer and leaner muscles.<END>

'Many teachers promote the dancers who are thinner and taller and ignore the dancers who are not.'

Eager to win better parts, Anais started to diet. At the age of 16 she was surviving on just 600 calories a day. This developed into restriction, purging and over-exercising.

She continued: 'When I began to lose weight unhealthily, I was awarded with multiple lead roles for the first time and placed in the highest level.

'This fuelled my disorder and only made me more determined to get sicker.'

By the time she graduated, Anais was battling a severe eating disorder and was hospitalised during her first year of university.

She was forced to give up ballet and gained 20lbs. However 18 months after she returned to dance she suffered a 'very deadly relapse'.

She said: 'I was devastated because after all the sacrifice and work, I had regressed to a point even lower than before.

'This time it was different. No longer was I purging, abusing laxatives, or over exercising. This time I simply refused to eat; it was anorexia at its worst.

'I would dance for hours with nothing in my system, and I would rely on caffeine to get me through each day.'

Her turning point came when she was rushed to the emergency room after collapsing on a photo shoot.

She said: 'I felt really weak and delirious however, I wasn't scared. I thought I was going to die and I felt at peace knowing that I wouldn't suffer anymore from my eating disorder.

'It's sad to say but at the time I wouldn't have minded dying. I felt bad that my mum had to see me so sick. This event really woke me up to the reality of my disorder.'

Anais pledged to gain weight, saying she was 'fueled by her anger, determination and fear'.

She forced herself to meal prep and up her calories each week until she had reached 2000 calories a day.

She added: 'The most important thing I did was rest. My body had a lot to catch up on, so I slept for weeks.

'Slowly but surely my energy began returning and my weight began increasing.

'I only weighed myself at the doctor's office because I refused to be a slave to the scale in my own house considering I use to weigh myself after each meal.'

Now she is reclaiming control over her life both mentally and physically.

She said: 'In the past, I would turn down invitations, parties, meals, anything that possibly involved food.

'Now, I am rediscovering life and it's many benefits. I eat cake once in a while, and go out with friends when asked.

'I also recently started my blog to share my story and hopefully help others.'

Despite reaching a healthy weight, she admits she has further to go.

She added: 'I am heading in the right direction. I am only going to recover as much as my determination allows, and as of now I refuse to die.

'I am on a mission to recover fully and help others one day.'

**** ARTICLE #41: 20070928 - Tonga have been one of the major surprises in this tournament. (None) *****

Tonga have been one of the major surprises in this tournament.

After beating the USA, they upset Pacific Island neighbours Samoa before giving South Africa, one of the form sides and competition favourites, a big scare.

The Springboks, who eventually won 30-25, were forced to send their frontline players into the fray as the Tongans threatened to pull off a major upset.

Coming into the competition, Tonga, who are bidding to reach the last eight for the first time, only had two wins in three World Cups and lost every match in 2003.

"We have already made history for our country," said captain Nili Latu. "We want to go further."

Coach Quddus Fielea added: "It is very important for the boys, and I know they will be throwing everything into this game."

In contrast to Tonga, England have failed to play to their potential in this World Cup.

After beating the USA, they were crushed 36-0 by South Africa before bouncing back with a 44-22 win over Samoa.

Now their chances of progressing face another serious threat - and England coach Brian Ashton is under no illusions about the size of the task facing his side.

"We are still looking down the barrel of a gun," he said.

"Tonga are probably a stronger side than Samoa and they are no longer the surprise team. They've played pretty well throughout and we have enormous respect for them.

"They have a massive enthusiasm, cohesion up front and an ability to stay in the game for 80 minutes, which has not always been the case.

"Any momentary lapse in concentration could cause us lots of problems."

With prop Vickery starting the game on the bench following his two-game ban, Martin Corry will skipper the side.

And the Leicester forward says the team will not make the mistake of underestimating Tonga.

"We are going to have to win the game, and we expect to win the game, but that is taking nothing away from Tonga," he said.

"They are coming into this game full of confidence, but we are just focusing on ourselves and looking to improve on what we did against Samoa."

Ashton has made some bold choices in his selection, leaving Vickery on the bench and bringing Lewis Moody in at open-side flanker for his first start of the tournament.

But Jonny Wilkinson will continue his half-back partnership with scrum-half Andy Gomarsall.

<START>[Q318920|Wilkinson] missed the [QUANTITY|first] [QUANTITY|two] games of [Q124753|the tournament] because of an ankle injury but kicked [QUANTITY|24] points on [Q318920|his] return as [Q378628|England] beat [Q3590539|Samoa].

[Q318920|He] now needs another [QUANTITY|22] points to become the record points scorer in [Q16640|World Cups], eclipsing the [QUANTITY|227] amassed by [Q945016|Scotland] great [Q427291|Gavin Hastings].

[Q378628|England] and [Unknown1|Tonga] have met only once before in an officially recognised Test. It came in the [Q1141048|1999 World Cup], with [Q378628|England] easing to a [QUANTITY|101]-[QUANTITY|10] victory.<END>

But this time round promises to be a lot closer, with Latu promising: "We are going to throw the kitchen sink at England.

"People back home have been over the moon with what we have done, and it is rewarding for us to see where the country is now. Even being here is bringing Tongans together as one, but it's not just for us.

"We are here to do a job and change the face of rugby in the Islands, and in Tonga especially."

The Tongans had planned to take to the field with their hair dyed green to thank an Irish bookmaker for supporting them financially in France.

But the International Rugby Board says that would constitute advertising and has ordered Tonga not to go ahead with the publicity stunt.
