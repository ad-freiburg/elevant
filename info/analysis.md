### Fine-Grained Evaluation for Entity Linking
*Rosales-Mendez et al., 2019*

**Paper:** <https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1066.pdf>

(**More detailed paper:** <http://aidanhogan.com/docs/fine-grained-el.pdf>)

**Objective:**
Fair comparison of different Entity Linking systems considering the lack of a common definition of the Entity Linking task.

Rosales-Mendez et al. first sent a questionaire to authors of Entity Linking papers to find out where there is consensus and where disagreement about Entity Linking decisions (which kind of mentions should be linked to which entities).
The questionaire aims to investigate 6 different aspects of linking decisions:
1) Entity types: Should types not included in the MUC-6 definition be linked, such as for example the documentary "Living with Michael Jackson"? The consensus is yes.
2) Overlapping mentions: Should mentions inside other mentions be annotated, e.g. "Michael Jackson" in "Living with Michael Jackson"? 3/4 of respondents allow overlapping mentions.
3) Common entities: Should common nouns be annotated, e.g. "documentary"? Most respondents do not link common entities (> 2/3).
4) Parts of Speech: Should only nouns be annotated or also other parts of speech? The consensus is, that EL should focus on nouns, however pronouns were also considered for linking by 40% of respondents.
5) Mention types: Should complex types of mentions such as pronouns or descriptive noun phrases like "he and his four siblings" be annotated? No agreement between respondents.
6) Link types: Should mentions link to the explicitly named entity, e.g. in metonomy cases such as "Moscow" for the "government of Russia"? Most agree to link demonyms to the country and "Moscow" to the "government of Russia".

Rosales-Mendez et al. introduce a fine-grained categorization scheme for annotations.
The scheme has 4 dimensions:
1) Base Form:Proper noun with subcategories full name, short name, extended name and alias, numeric/temporal, common form (common words such as "documentary", noun phrases like "he and his four siblings") and pro-form (pronouns)
2) Part of Speech: Noun phrase (singular, plural), adjective, verb, adverb
3) Overlap: None, Maximal ("New York City Police Museum"), Intermediate ("New York City Police" in "New York City Police Museum"), Minimal ("New York" in "New York City Police Museum")
4) Reference: Direct ("M. Jackson", "King of Pop"), Anaphoric (reference to an antecedent or postcedent for pronouns), Metaphoric, Metonymic, Related (only a near-synonym, hypernym or hyponym is available in the KB), Descriptive ("Fiji's capital", "his father")

The authors then re-annotate three existing benchmarks (ACE2004, KORE50 and VoxEL) using their proposed annotation scheme - each annotation is assigned exactly one leaf-node of each category.
They also label some mentions with multiple alternatives (e.g. metonymy or demonym cases).

They then perform a fine-grained evaluation of 6 different systems (Babelfy, TagMe, DBpedia Spotlight, AIDA and FREME), computing precision, recall and f1 score for each leaf-node for each system.
They conclude that this might be a too fine-grained evaluation to compare different systems and introduce a fuzzy recall and F1 metric.
For this they define a membership function µ which assigns each ground truth annotation a membership degree between 0 and 1 where a higher value places more importance on achieving the annotations.
Annotations with consensus > 0.9 in their questionaire are assigned a membership degree of 1 (Proper Forms, Noun Phrases, No Overlap and Direct Reference).
All other annotations get a constant membership degree of alpha.
For a set of ground truth annotations G and a set of predicted links S, fuzzy recall is then defined as R* = sum_{a in S} µ(a) / sum_{a in G} µ(a). 
They find that the results distinguish the systems that link common entities (Babelfy (relaxed) and TagME) from those that do not.
The systems that link common entities outperform other systems when the definition of EL annotations is relaxed and perform worse for stricter definitions of EL annotations.

### Framing Named Entity Linking Error Types
*Bra̧soveanu et al., 2018*

**Paper:** <https://aclanthology.org/L18-1040.pdf>

**Objective:**
An in-depth qualitative analysis of entity linking errors is necessary in order to rapidly improve EL systems.

Bra̧soveanu et al propose a classification of EL errors into
1) Knowledge Base errors: errors in a particular KB version, e.g. missing entities or wrong mappings
2) Dataset errors: errors produced by the dataset annotators, e.g. missing / wrong annotations
3) Annotator errors: errors produced by the automatic annotation (linking) system
4) NIL clustering errors: e.g. missing surface forms for entities or new links in a more recent version of the DB
5) Scorer / evaluation errors: errors reported by an evaluation system if the Dataset and Annotator outputs are similar
They select different benchmarks and systems and classify errors by hand into these categories, providing additional information on the error like its cause.
Their evaluation is very short, with their main result being that most errors are AN errors.

### Visual Error Analysis for Entity Linking
*Heinzerling and Strube, 2015*

** Paper:** <https://aclanthology.org/P15-4007.pdf>

**Objective:**
Create a tool for visually exploring and analyzing entity linking results.

They have more fine-grained errors than just FP, FN, ... but they don't include any evaluation.
They simply present their tool.

### Evaluating Entity Linking: An Analysis of Current Benchmark Datasets and a Roadmap for Doing a Better Job
*van Erp et al., 2016*

**Paper:** <http://giusepperizzo.github.io/publications/vanErp_Rizzo-LREC2016.pdf>

**Objective:**
Evaluate current entity linking benchmarks, analyze their strenghts and weaknesses and derive suggestions for how to create better benchmarks.

Van Erp et al. analyze 6 different EL benchmarks, but only AIDA-YAGO seems to be frequently used in the EL community.
They collect and compare entity-mention characteristics like entity overlap (between datasets), confusability (~ number of possible candidates for a mention), prominence, dominance (~ probability of an entity given a mention) and entity types.
They argue that on benchmarks with low confusability, high prominence and high dominance, simple popularity-based benchmark systems can already achieve high accuracies.
Regarding entity types they argue that country and company names are typically unique, while this is less often the case for names of cities or persons.
They therefore expect the entity type distribution to directly impact the difficulty of a benchmark.
In accordance to our findings they also report that AIDA-YAGO has a strong emphasis on sports related entities such as athletes or sports teams.
They further collect mention-annotation characteristics like mention boundaries (inclusion of determiners "the", ...), handling redundancy (annotating only the first or all occurrences of an entity), inter-annotation agreement, mention ambiguity, ..., nested entities.
Their suggestions for how to create better benchmarks are rather sparse.
They suggest to focus on documentation (which decisions were made in the process of creating the dataset, e.g. initial offset count 0 or 1), standard formats (or scripts that allow the user to transform a benchmark into a standardized format) and diversity (high confusibility, low prominence, low dominance benchmarks with texts from different domains). 


### A step further towards a consensus on linking tweets to Wikipedia
*Nait‑Hamoud et al., 2021*

**Paper:** <https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12065-020-00549-8.pdf>

**Objective:**
Introduce a set of rules to define the entity linking task for tweets. The effectiveness of the defined rules is analyzed by implementing an end-to-end entity linking system for tweets.

Nait‑Hamoud et al. describe a discrepancy between different entity linking benchmarks for tweets.
They provide a set of rules and guidelines to find a consensus for EL benchmarks.
These rules are:
- The mention is not a Twitter user mention.
- The linked entity is a proper entity according to their definition (--> the entity has a corresponding Wikipedia page which is not a redirect or disambiguation page)
- The mention is the primary topic of the linked entity.
- Annotate longest coherent entities in tweets.
- Annotate from the remaining mentions in the text dominant entities of types: Person, Organization, Location, Character, Events, Products, and Thing proposed in the taxonomy of the NEEL 2016 challenge


### Evaluating Entity Linking with Wikipedia
*Hachey et al., 2013*

**Paper:** <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370212000446>

**Objective:**
Evaluate different aspects of entity linking such as candidate generation, akronym handling or co-reference resolution to find out which components have the biggest impact on entity linking performance.

Hachey et al. reimplement three state of the art entity linking systems.
A primary goal is to independently analyze the candidate generation and the candidate ranking step.
Their conclusion is that candidate generation accounts for more variation in performance between systems than candidate ranking.
Additionally they find that co-reference resolution and akronym detection have a larger impact than candidate ranking

Hachey et al. discuss various datasets, among them the MSNBC and TAC datasets.
They differentiate between cross-document coreference, wikification and named entity linking and use named entity disambiguation as a term to describe all three of these tasks.
According to them, the difference between wikification and named entity linking is that wikification includes concept linking and does not include links to NIL whereas named entity linking only deals with named entities and requires a system to link to NIL if no matching entity was found in the knowledge base.
Hachey et al. suggest to separate the task of named entity linking into three components: an extractor (extracting mention spans), a searcher (searching for entity candidates) and a disambiguator (settle on a single suitable candidate)
