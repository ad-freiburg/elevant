{"name": "AIDA-CoNLL (dev)", "description": "Development set (test A) of the AIDA-CoNLL dataset. 216 news articles from the 1990s. The benchmark is based on the CoNLL-2003 dataset for NER tagging. Hoffart et al. manually annotated the existing proper-noun mentions with corresponding entities in the YAGO2 knowledge base. The dataset has a strong tendency towards sports articles - almost half of the articles are sports related. This results in a large amount of demonym and metonym entity mentions.", "timestamp": "2024/07/11 15:20"}
