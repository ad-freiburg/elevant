The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P.

Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japans Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart. The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japans failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments. They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers. Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments. President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement. In making the annoucement, Reagan said I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade. Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japans semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues. Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagans inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs. About one-third of the deficit was with Japan. Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it. Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation. He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagans decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITIs power to control Japanese traders. The United States has excessive expectations., he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time.

{"id": 52, "title": "http://aksw.org/N3/Reuters-128/30#char=0,2886", "text": "Promising new findings in the use of a controversial experimental drug called Interleukin-2 as a cure for cancer will be published in the April 9 issue of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, according to a Wall Street analyst who has obtained an advance copy of the magazine. Among interleukins principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp CTUS, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp IMNX, based in Seattle, Wash. The journal, to be released late today, contains two articles reporting high remission rates several cancer types. The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search for a successful immunotherapy for cancer. Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally produced by living cells in the laboratory. The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its ravaging side effects. One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after it changed the way in which the drug is administered. In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities Stuart Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine. For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital care, according to the article. In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum. In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness of the drugs side effects as originally administered. Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search for successful immunotherapy for cancer, said the editorial, signed by John Durant of Philadelphias Chase Cancer Center. These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely did not describe successful practical approaches ready for widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients, the editorial said. On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, a successful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then we may be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction in the immunuotherapy of cancer, the editorial concluded.", "evaluation_span": [0, 2886], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [171, 202], "entity_id": "Q582728", "name": "The New England Journal of Medicine", "type": "Q17537576|Q2424752"}, {"id": 1, "span": [219, 230], "entity_id": "Q11690", "name": "Wall Street", "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 2, "span": [335, 345], "entity_id": "Q5065711", "name": "Cetus Corporation", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 3, "span": [369, 379], "entity_id": "Q499178", "name": "Emeryville", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 4, "span": [381, 386], "entity_id": "Q99", "name": "California", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 5, "span": [393, 410], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 6, "span": [421, 428], "entity_id": "Q5083", "name": "Seattle", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 7, "span": [430, 434], "entity_id": "Q25301", "name": "Washington", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 8, "span": [1121, 1133], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 9, "span": [1137, 1156], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 10, "span": [1160, 1168], "entity_id": "Q984264", "name": "Franklin", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 11, "span": [1170, 1174], "entity_id": "Q1509", "name": "Tennessee", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 12, "span": [1509, 1536], "entity_id": "Q7252988", "name": "Prudential Securities", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 13, "span": [1537, 1552], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 14, "span": [1852, 1872], "entity_id": "Q2347448", "name": "Steven Rosenberg", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 15, "span": [1880, 1905], "entity_id": "Q664846", "name": "National Cancer Institute", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 16, "span": [2108, 2133], "entity_id": "Q664846", "name": "National Cancer Institute", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 17, "span": [2403, 2414], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 18, "span": [2418, 2451], "entity_id": "Q5476635", "name": "Fox Chase Cancer Center", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 19, "span": [2484, 2493], "entity_id": "Q2347448", "name": "Steven Rosenberg", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 20, "span": [2498, 2502], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}]}

Southerns Georgia Power Co subsidiary has a 45.7 pct interest in the plant and estimated earlier this year it would cost a total of 8.87 billion dlrs. Last year, the plants owners pledged to Georgia regulators they would limit the cost passed on to rate payers to 8.4 billion dlrs. The Southern spokeswoman said the company feels the report by OBrien-Kreitzberg is flawed and biased. She said the report was released yesterday by the state attorney general. Responding to the report today, Georgia Power Chairman Robert W. Scherer told a news conference the conclusions drawn by the firm are not only wrong -- they also reflect the same bias against nuclear power that these auditors have demonstrated in similar cases accross the country. Saying he was not suggesting Georgia power was without fault, Scherer said the audit identified several things I wish we had done differently. Scherer pointed out a report OBrien-Kreitzberg submitted to Georgia regulators in March 1986 projected Georgia Power would not finish Plant Vogtle unit one before the end of 1987. Noting unit one is finished, and we expect it to be in commercial operationg by June, he said the firms latest report ignored the earlier projection, gave the utility no credit for the completion and actually penalized us by suggesting that costs to maintain t he schedule be disallowed. Scherer said the latest audit alleges Georgia Power could have saved 95 mln dlrs if it had stopped using four shifts, seven days a week to speed construction three years sooner. He said this would have delayed completion of the plant for another year and it would have cost several hunderd million dlrs more. Noting the audit said costs were increased 600 mln dlrs by schedule delays totaling 20.5 months, he said First, we have the best concrete placement record in the industry, Second new government regulations after the Three Mile Island incident significantly increased construction time.", "evaluation_span": [0, 2168], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [26, 59], "entity_id": "Q5547671", "name": "Georgia Public Service Commission", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 1, "span": [134, 168], "entity_id": "Q947549", "name": "Vogtle Electric Generating Plant", "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 2, "span": [193, 204], "entity_id": "Q2304693", "name": "Southern Company", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 3, "span": [233, 249], "entity_id": "Q5547666", "name": "Georgia Power", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 4, "span": [414, 421], "entity_id": "Q5547666", "name": "Georgia Power", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 5, "span": [567, 584], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 6, "span": [713, 726], "entity_id": "Q5547666", "name": "Georgia Power", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 7, "span": [736, 753], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 8, "span": [992, 1005], "entity_id": "Q5547666", "name": "Georgia Power", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 9, "span": [1025, 1032], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 10, "span": [1106, 1113], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 11, "span": [1166, 1173], "entity_id": "Q5547666", "name": "Georgia Power", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 12, "span": [1209, 1222], "entity_id": "Q5547666", "name": "Georgia Power", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 13, "span": [1240, 1252], "entity_id": "Q947549", "name": "Vogtle Electric Generating Plant", "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 14, "span": [1574, 1581], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 15, "span": [1612, 1625], "entity_id": "Q5547666", "name": "Georgia Power", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}]}

They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available.

{"id": 72, "title": "http://aksw.org/N3/Reuters-128/49#char=0,5148", "text": "Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.", "evaluation_span": [0, 5148], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [375, 383], "entity_id": "Q5512817", "name": "GAF", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 1, "span": [385, 388], "entity_id": "Q5512817", "name": "GAF", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 2, "span": [406, 423], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 3, "span": [522, 537], "entity_id": "Q725634", "name": "Ashland Inc.", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 4, "span": [539, 542], "entity_id": "Q725634", "name": "Ashland Inc.", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 5, "span": [549, 557], "entity_id": "Q1603", "name": "Kentucky", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 6, "span": [716, 729], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 7, "span": [749, 764], "entity_id": "Q855639", "name": "Dow Chemical Company", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 8, "span": [766, 769], "entity_id": "Q855639", "name": "Dow Chemical Company", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 9, "span": [1261, 1272], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 10, "span": [1295, 1315], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 11, "span": [1319, 1326], "entity_id": "Q16555", "name": "Houston", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 12, "span": [1430, 1438], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 13, "span": [1487, 1494], "entity_id": "Q16555", "name": "Houston", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 14, "span": [1501, 1504], "entity_id": "Q855639", "name": "Dow Chemical Company", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 15, "span": [1748, 1751], "entity_id": "Q855639", "name": "Dow Chemical Company", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 16, "span": [1863, 1871], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 17, "span": [1878, 1881], "entity_id": "Q5512817", "name": "GAF", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 18, "span": [1891, 1904], "entity_id": "Q7411804", "name": "Samuel J.

The sources said the depressed world market had been one of the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the 11-member CPA which began on Monday. They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his effort to support prices. Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the market soon. Prices, under the weight of three successive cocoa surpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager has to buy cocoa under stock rules. The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set range by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise. The worlds cocoa price at present is just not interesting, commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer. Another source said that with much of the 1986/87 (October-September) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales in the near term concerns essentially next years harvest. The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry in Brazil, the worlds number two producer, is in private hands. This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major West African producers, where sales are made or authorized by commodity marketing boards.

That decision, spurred by Brazils suspension of interest payments on February 20, reduced the quarters net income by 20 mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the first three months of 1986. Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln dlrs in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and underwriting of Euromarket securities. Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether Morgans trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket. On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln. Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln.

If Brazil does not resume payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added.

It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49 mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier.

Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia, told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this years estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost. He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage problems. Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes, theoretically sufficient for the crop. But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul had between them 70 pct of the nations capacity, but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production. The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage capacity. Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nations grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space. In addition to the poor distribution of storage units, there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain, Brito said. Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the crops. The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports, which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.", "evaluation_span": [0, 1490], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [108, 128], "entity_id": "Q4294676", "name": "Ministry of Agriculture of Brazil", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 1, "span": [164, 178], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 2, "span": [194, 202], "entity_id": "Q2844", "name": "Bras\u00edlia", "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 3, "span": [209, 216], "entity_id": "Q130879", "name": "Reuters", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 4, "span": [443, 449], "entity_id": "Q155", "name": "Brazil", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 5, "span": [534, 539], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 6, "span": [608, 617], "entity_id": "Q175", "name": "S\u00e3o Paulo", "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 7, "span": [619, 625], "entity_id": "Q15499", "name": "Paran\u00e1", "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 8, "span": [630, 647], "entity_id": "Q40030", "name": "Rio Grande do Sul", "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 9, "span": [884, 889], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 10, "span": [1242, 1247], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}]}

As in previous flotations, clawback arrangements would be made if public subscriptions exceeded initial allocations.

A decision on what percentage would go to each sector would be made shortly before the sale price was announced on April 28. Minimum subscription would be for 400 shares with payment in two tranches, again a method broadly in line with previous privatisations. Chairman Sir Francis Tombs denied suggestions that Rolls was a stock that should be left to the institutions. He noted that although the aircraft industry was cyclical, Rolls had several operations -- such as spare parts and military equipment -- that evened out the swings. Rolls 1986 research and development expenditure in 1986 was 255 mln stg and could be expected in the future to vary according to changes in turnover.
