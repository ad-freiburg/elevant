{"id": 38629618, "title": "List of Via Rail rolling stock", "text": "List of Via Rail rolling stock\n\nThis is a list of past and present rolling stock owned and operated by Via Rail in Canada. Via Rail owns 78 locomotives and 396 passenger cars. The tables below list that equipment by type and include some information regarding previously-owned and operated equipment. When Via began operation in 1976\u20131978 it was with a collection of equipment inherited from the Canadian National Railway (CN) and Canadian Pacific Railway (CP). Much of this equipment remains in use today. Over the years Via has supplemented this initial fleet with new orders and with new acquisitions of secondhand equipment from other operators.\n\nVia operates diesel locomotives exclusively. Its fleet of GMD F40PH-2s was recently modernized. The newer GE P42DCs are found only on Corridor services.\n\nIn December 2018, VIA Rail Canada ordered 32 trainsets - each powered by a Charger locomotive - from Siemens for use on the Qu\u00e9bec City\u2013Windsor Corridor.\n\nVia inherited a diverse fleet of diesel locomotives from the Canadian National and Canadian Pacific Railways. It also received three of the experimental UAC TurboTrain gas-turbine trainsets. Between 1980\u20131984 Bombardier delivered 31 LRC (\"Light, Rapid, Comfortable\") diesel locomotives with matching cars. The last of these was retired in 2002.\n\nThe core of Via's long-range fleet is a collection of streamlined equipment originally built by the Budd Company for the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1950s. These were rebuilt by AMF to use head end power and thus are often referred to as the \"HEP\" fleet.\n\nLRC was a series of lightweight diesel-powered passenger trains built by Bombardier that were used on short- to medium-distance inter-city service in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The LRC family includes both locomotives and passenger carriages designed to work together, though the two can be, and now are, used separately. The last locomotives were retired in 2001 but the coaches remain in service.\n\nThe Renaissance fleet was originally built by Alstom in the mid-1990s for the proposed \"Nightstar\" overnight service between the United Kingdom and continental Europe via the Channel Tunnel. Via acquired the entire fleet in 2000 for C$130 million after the Nightstar concept was abandoned. The cars entered service in 2002. Presently, four sets are in service: two on the Ocean, overnight between Montreal and Halifax, and two in the corridor, between Ottawa and Quebec City.\n\nThe Budd Rail Diesel Car (RDC) is a self-propelled diesel multiple unit railcar. These were used extensively by both the Canadian National and Canadian Pacific Railways for outlying routes. Via currently rosters seven RDCs and contracted with Industrial Rail Services for C$12.6 million to refurbish and upgrade all six. The upgraded units would include new seating, wheelchair accessible washrooms, LED interior lighting, controls, wiring, heating, air conditioning systems, braking systems and rebuilt engines that meet Euro 2 standards. The rebuilt units have also been modified to remove the control cab from one end of each unit, so passengers are never required to pass through the cab when entering or exiting the train. Following the bankruptcy of IRSI, work rebuilding the RDCs was completed by Canadian Allied Diesel (CAD) at the IRSI facility in Moncton.\n\nThe 2018 Canadian federal budget included funding for the purchase of 32 trainsets to replace equipment used in Corridor service in Ontario and Quebec. With money allocated, Via issued a request for proposals in 2018, with delivery of the new rolling stock scheduled for 2022. In December 2018, VIA Rail Canada ordered 32 trainsets from Siemens for use on the Qu\u00e9bec City\u2013Windsor Corridor, at a cost of $989 million. Trainsets will be powered by diesel-electric Charger locomotives, with passenger car trainsets from the Siemens Viaggio Comfort family. Similar trainsets are in use with Railjet in Austria, and the Czech Republic, and Virgin Trains USA in Florida, USA.\n\n", "links": [[[67, 80], "rolling stock"], [[103, 111], "Via Rail"], [[115, 121],

The types of \"sectores\" may vary, from normally \"sector\" to \"urbanizaci\u00f3n\" to \"reparto\" to \"barriada\" to \"residencial\", among others.\n\nThe following are in Ci\u00e9naga Baja barrio:\n\n, and\n\nIn Ci\u00e9naga Baja is the , and part of the R\u00edo Grande urban area.\n\n", "links": [[[32, 38], "Barrios of Puerto Rico"], [[62, 85], "R\u00edo Grande, Puerto Rico"], [[127, 140], "United States"], [[174, 179], "Spain"], [[204, 224], "Spanish-American War"], [[248, 271], "Treaty of Paris (1898)"], [[441, 451], "R\u00edo Grande, Puerto Rico"]], "title_synonyms": [[14, 26]], "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59703814", "evaluation_span": [123, 890], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [123, 140], "entity_id": "Q30", "name": "United States of America", "parent": null, "children": [1], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 1, "span": [127, 140], "entity_id": "Q30", "name": "United States of America", "parent": 0, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 2, "span": [157, 168], "entity_id": "Q1183", "name": "Puerto Rico", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213", "level1": true}, {"id": 3, "span": [174, 179], "entity_id": "Q29", "name": "Spain", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 4, "span": [204, 224], "entity_id": "Q12583", "name": "Spanish\u2013American War", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q1656682", "level1": true}, {"id": 5, "span": [248, 271], "entity_id": "Q847137", "name": "Treaty of Paris", "parent": null, "children": [6, 7], "optional": false, "type": "Q17537576", "level1": true}, {"id": 6, "span": [248, 263], "entity_id": "Q847137", "name": "Treaty of Paris", "parent": 5, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q17537576", "level1": true}, {"id": 7, "span": [267, 271], "entity_id": "DATETIME", "name": "Unknown", "parent": 5, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "DATETIME", "level1": null}, {"id": 8, "span": [276, 280], "entity_id": "DATETIME", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "DATETIME", "level1": null}, {"id": 9, "span": [282, 299], "entity_id": "Q30", "name": "United States of America", "parent": null, "children": [10], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 10, "span": [286, 299], "entity_id": "Q30", "name": "United States of America", "parent": 9, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 11, "span": [310, 313], "entity_id": "Q30", "name": "United States of America", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 12, "span": [314, 319], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "QUANTITY", "level1": null}, {"id": 13, "span": [330, 341], "entity_id": "Q1183", "name": "Puerto Rico", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213", "level1": true}, {"id": 14, "span": [374, 388], "entity_id": "Q5547538", "name": "Ci\u00e9naga Baja", "parent": null, "children": [15], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213", "level1": true}, {"id": 15, "span": [374, 381], "entity_id": "Q5547538", "name": "Ci\u00e9naga Baja", "parent": 14, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213", "level1": true}, {"id": 16, "span": [393, 398], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "QUANTITY", "level1": null}, {"id": 17, "span": [428, 439], "entity_id": "Q1183", "name": "Puerto Rico", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213", "level1": true}, {"id": 18, "span": [441, 451], "entity_id": "Q979996", "name": "R\u00edo Grande", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 19, "span": [563, 570], "entity_id": "Q1321", "name": "Spanish", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q17376908", "level1": true}, {"id": 20, "span": [704, 711], "entity_id": "Q1321", "name": "Spanish", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q17376908", "level1": true}, {"id": 21, "span": [870, 889], "entity_id": "Q5547538", "name": "Ci\u00e9naga Baja", "parent": null, "children": [22], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213", "level1": true}, {"id": 22, "span": [870, 882], "entity_id": "Q5547538", "name": "Ci\u00e9naga Baja", "parent": 21, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213", "level1": true}]}
{"id": 2826797, "title": "USS John R. Pierce", "text": "USS John R. Pierce\n\nUSS \"John R. Pierce\" (DD-753), an , is the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for Lieutenant Commander John Reeves Pierce, who commanded , a transport submarine, which was lost during battle in January 1943. Lieutenant Commander Pierce was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross.\n\n\"John R. Pierce\" was laid down by the Bethlehem Steel Co., Staten Island, New York on 24 March 1944 and launched on 1 September 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Mary Taylor Pierce, widow of Lieutenant Commander. Pierce. The ship was commissioned on 30 December 1944 at Brooklyn Navy Yard, Commander C. R. Simmers in command.\n\nFollowing shakedown off Bermuda, \"John R. Pierce\" operated out of Norfolk, Virginia during the spring of 1945, training destroyer crews and conducting antisubmarine warfare (ASW) patrols along the eastern seaboard. She sailed on 17 June for duty in the Pacific, arrived Pearl Harbor on 6 July. Departing on 12 August as escort for an aircraft carrier-cruiser striking force sent to attack Wake Island, she was ordered to cease offensive operations on 15 August. She then proceeded via Eniwetok to Japan and arrived Wakayama, Honsh\u016b on 15 September as escort for a convoy of occupation troops. Crew members were the first Americans to enter Hiroshima after the atomic bomb attack.\n\nFor the next three months, she operated in the Japanese Inland Sea, covering occupation landings and assisting in the liberation of Allied POWs. She sailed on 21 December from Kure, Honsh\u016b, to Shanghai, China, to support the Chinese Nationalists in their conflict with the Communists for control of the mainland. She also conducted the \"North China Omnibus Courier Run\" between China and Korea until 6 March 1946, when she departed Qingdao, China, for the United States.\n\nArriving at San Francisco on 27 March, she deactivated 16 September. \"John R. Pierce\" then sailed for San Diego on 17 January 1947, decommissioned 24 January and entered the San Diego Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet on 1 May.\n\n\"John R. Pierce\" recommissioned on 11 April 1949, Commander O. W. Goepner in command. Assigned to the Atlantic Fleet, she departed on 11 July for Norfolk. Arriving on 5 August, she commenced twelve months of Atlantic operations that extended from Greenland to the Panama Canal Zone. Under the command of Commander J. R. Wadleigh, she cleared Norfolk on 8 August 1950 for duty with the 6th Fleet. Before returning to the United States on 23 January 1951, she operated in the Mediterranean from Gibraltar to Crete and along the western coast of Europe from England to Norway.\n\nFor more than 15 months, \"John R. Pierce\" operated out of Norfolk along the Atlantic coast; then she departed on 15 May 1952 for duty in the Far East. Sailing via the Panama Canal, San Diego and Pearl Harbor, she arrived Yokosuka, Japan on 18 June. With Commander O. C. Foote, Jr. in command, she sailed on 20 June for blockade and bombardment operations against Communist forces along the east coast of Korea. From Chongjin to Songjin, she conducted interdiction firing and \"anti-mine, anti-junk and anti-fishing\" patrols. While engaging enemy shore batteries at Songjin on 6 August, she sustained three hits from enemy fire, but continued interdiction patrols until 11 October. She then departed for the United States via the Indian Ocean, Suez and Gibraltar, arriving Norfolk 12 December.\n\nFrom 5 January 1954 to 1 April 1962 \"John R. Pierce\" deployed to the Mediterranean on six cruises of varying duration. When not conducting operations with the 6th Fleet, she operated out of her home port on training exercises and readiness operations in the Atlantic and the Caribbean. When in the Mediterranean, fleet operations carried her the length and breadth of the sea, and deployments in 1954 and 1956 sent her, in addition, to the coast of Western Europe.\n\nOn 1 October 1956, 75 miles south of Villefranche, the ship was on aerial gunnery exercise firing at a towed aerial target, when at 0950, a shell exploded in the breech of mount 53, killing a member of the mount and seriously wounding nine others. Three of the injured were in grave condition and later died. Doctors from were taken by helicopter to the destroyer, and then transferred the wounded to the cruiser at sea. Then, \"Salem\" took the men to Villefranche to be transported to Nice Airport, France, where a C-119 Flying Boxcar waited to fly them to a military hospital in Frankfurt, Germany. One of the seriously wounded was Ensign John T. Pierce, son of John R. Pierce, for whom the ship was named. After the wounded were transferred, \"John R. Pierce\" went to Cannes, France and arrived on 2 October. She stayed there until 15 October and then got under way for the states. She refueled at S\u00e3o Miguel in the Azores on 20 October and again in Bermuda on 25 October, arriving in Norfolk on 27 October. From there, she went to the Philadelphia Naval Yard for repairs.\n\nEngaged primarily in conducting ASW barrier patrols and screening carrier flight operations, \"John R. Pierce\" responded when the Syrian Army threatened King Hussein's pro-Western government of Jordan during August and September 1957, destroyers, including \"John r. Pierce\", patrolled the sea lanes of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Red Sea to guard against possible intervention by Egypt. She returned to the same area in December 1958 to bolster the security of Lebanon, recently threatened by the Soviet-backed United Arab Republic. Following the assassination of General Trujillo on 27 May 1961, the destroyer patrolled off the Dominican Republic.\n\nReturning to Norfolk 1 April 1962 from her seventh Mediterranean cruise, she sailed on 15 May to participate in Project Mercury recovery operations following Lieutenant Commander M. Scott Carpenter's scheduled three-orbit flight in \"Aurora 7\". On 24 April she steamed 206 miles at flank speed from her designated position in the Atlantic Recovery Area east of Puerto Rico and recovered the floating space capsule. After delivering it safely at Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, the next day, she returned to Norfolk 28 May before resuming duty in the Caribbean.\n\nDuring the Cuban Missile Crisis, under the command of Commander J. W. Foust, \"John R. Pierce\" departed Norfolk 22 October; joined the quarantine force on 24 October; and during the next five days, investigated 13 ships. On 28 October, the Soviets agreed to the American demands, thus alleviating a tense and crucial crisis. \"John R. Pierce\" departed from her assigned position the following day, but she continued a Caribbean sea-vigil from Jamaica to the Canal Zone until returning to Norfolk 14 December.\n\nShe departed home port on 29 March 1963 for the Mediterranean and the Middle East. After two weeks of maneuvers with the 6th Fleet, she transited the Suez Canal on 30 April and commenced an 11-week cruise through the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea, and the Persian Gulf. Returning to the Mediterranean 16 July, she resumed fleet operations. On 14 August she rescued three survivors of a plane that splashed off her starboard bow while attempting an emergency landing on . Departing Palma, Majorca, 24 August, she arrived Norfolk 4 September.\n\n\"John R. Pierce\" spent the next year operating out of Norfolk; and during off-shore surveillance patrols in January 1964 she escorted five Cuban boats, which were illegally fishing in U.S. territorial waters, to Key West for internment. Once again she departed Norfolk for the Mediterranean 8 October. Reaching Naples late in the month, she joined the 6th Fleet and through the remainder of the year operated along the western coast of Italy.\n\n\"John R. Pierce\" returned to Norfolk 27 February 1965. She reported to Commandant of the 3rd Naval District in Brooklyn, New York, for duty as a reserve training ship and began a schedule of 2-week training cruises for naval reservists. She continued this duty into 1973.\n\n\"John R. Pierce\" received one battle star for service during the Korean War.\n\n", "links": [[[80, 98], "United States Navy"], [[115, 135], "Lieutenant Commander"], [[136, 154], "John Reeves Pierce"], [[184, 193], "submarine"], [[298, 308], "Navy Cross (United States)"], [[332, 341], "Keel laying"], [[349, 368], "Bethlehem Steel Corporation"], [[370, 393], "Staten Island, New York"], [[415, 423], "Ship naming and launching"], [[535, 547], "Ship commissioning"], [[571, 589], "Brooklyn Navy Yard"], [[591, 600], "Commander"], [[652, 659], "Bermuda"], [[694, 711], "Norfolk, Virginia"], [[779, 800], "antisubmarine warfare"], [[898, 910], "Pearl Harbor"], [[962, 978], "aircraft carrier"], [[979, 986], "cruiser"], [[1017, 1028], "Wake Island"], [[1113, 1121], "Eniwetok"], [[1143, 1151], "Wakayama, Wakayama"], [[1153, 1159], "Honsh\u016b"], [[1268, 1277], "Hiroshima"], [[1441, 1447], "Allies of World War II"], [[1448, 1451], "POW"], [[1485, 1489], "Kure"], [[1502, 1510], "Shanghai"], [[1534, 1554], "Chinese Nationalists"], [[1741, 1748], "Qingdao"], [[1793, 1806], "San Francisco"], [[2252, 2261], "Greenland"], [[2269, 2286], "Panama Canal Zone"], [[2390, 2399], "United States Sixth Fleet"], [[2498, 2507], "Gibraltar"], [[2511, 2516], "Crete"], [[2560, 2567], "England"], [[2571, 2577], "Norway"], [[2996, 3004], "Chongjin"], [[3008, 3015], "Songjin"], [[3331, 3340], "Gibraltar"], [[3532, 3541], "United States Sixth Fleet"], [[3876, 3888], "Villefranche-sur-Mer"], [[4354, 4373], "C-119 Flying Boxcar"], [[4419, 4428], "Frankfurt"], [[4472, 4478], "Ensign (rank)"], [[4608, 4614], "Cannes"], [[4738, 4748], "S\u00e3o Miguel Island"], [[4756, 4762], "Azores"], [[4790, 4797], "Bermuda"], [[4876, 4899], "Philadelphia Naval Yard"], [[5107, 5113], "Jordan"], [[5483, 5499], "General Trujillo"], [[5548, 5566], "Dominican Republic"], [[5681, 5696], "Project Mercury"], [[5748, 5766], "M.

{"id": 34367747, "title": "Ray Dixon", "text": "Ray Dixon\n\nRay Dixon is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera \"EastEnders\", played by Chucky Venn. Ray is an ex-partner of character Bianca Butcher (Patsy Palmer) and the father of her son Morgan Butcher (Devon Higgs). He made his first on screen appearance on 10 January 2012. His storylines have involved meeting and getting to know Morgan, a relationship with Kim Fox (Tameka Empson) and starting a youth mentoring scheme. On 16 April 2013 it was announced that Venn had been written out of the show, and departed on 28 May 2013. He appeared in 107 episodes.\n\nRay is first mentioned in the episode broadcast on 9 January 2012, when Morgan asks about his father and Bianca says it is Barack Obama. Bianca's adopted daughter, Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), knowing the truth, attempts to contact Ray. Whitney takes Morgan to meet Ray the next day, and he soon comes to Walford to see Morgan. He saves Kim Fox (Tameka Empson) from a falling ladder, and she is attracted to him. Bianca soon realises that Whitney has taken Morgan to meet Ray, but does not want them to see each other, and Kim is disappointed to learn that Ray has a son. Whitney soon convinces Bianca to let Morgan see Ray again. Ray returns shortly after, wanting to spend more time with his son and offering to cook a meal for Bianca's family, although when Ray reveals he has a daughter, Sasha Dixon (Rebecca Sanneh), Bianca throws him out. He successfully gets a job as a barman and chef at The Queen Victoria public house. On his first day, Sasha arrives meets Morgan and Kim. Ray asks Kim out on a date, but Bianca is angry so takes Morgan out, and Kim tells Ray she has had enough of men with \"baggage\". Ray continues to pursue Kim but she insists she is busy. Ray tells Bianca he wishes he could have been there for Morgan and how he changed his priorities for Sasha. Bianca misreads his kindness and goes to kiss him, but he turns away. When Ray discovers that Bianca is struggling with money, he gives her \u00a3300, saying it is for back-payments for Morgan. He starts to get somewhere with Kim but she suddenly leaves. He later hears from Kim's sister Denise Fox (Diane Parish) that Kim has caught head lice, so he gives Kim a hat to wear and they finally kiss. Kim becomes jealous when Ray playfights with Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) and later when he flirts with Bianca. As a result, she accidentally slices off the top of Ray's finger when he tries to help her fillet some fish. She accompanies him to the hospital where they open up to one another and decide to start a relationship.\n\nAfter Bianca is imprisoned, her mother Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson) decides to move with Bianca's children closer to the prison. Ray realises he cannot make Morgan choose between him and his mother, so allows him to leave. Ray then invites Sasha to stay with him, but Kim says she cannot take on his children. However, Kim is soon forced to look after Sasha, which pleases Ray. Kim and Ray then declare their love for one another. Ray is thrilled when Morgan returns for the wedding of his aunt, Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks). He bickers with Morgan's adoptive father, Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) over his parenting methods, but the pair reconcile when Morgan gets upset and Ray thanks Ricky for bringing Morgan up in his absence. Ray moves into Kim's bed and breakfast when his landlord increases his rent. Kim tells Sasha she can organise some work experience for her with a forensic scientist. She later admits this was a lie, leading to Ray moving out. Kim then gets Sasha a placement with Les Coker's (Roger Sloman) firm of funeral directors, and Ray and Kim make up. Ray becomes secretive and Kim suspects he is having an affair. She then finds information about local flats and assumes that Ray is looking for somewhere for them both to live. However, Ray reveals that the flat is for Sasha's mother, Deanne, so they can both be closer to Sasha. Kim feels upset and humiliated. However, he affirms his love for her and they reconcile.\n\nRay is angry when a police officer stops him, suspecting him of a mugging. Ray claims that the police officer is being racist, but feels he cannot do anything about it, until Kim and Denise urge him to become a mentor for children facing similar circumstances. With funding from Sport England, he successfully starts his mentoring scheme, \"Fighting Fit\", at the local boxing club. When Denise is feeling sad about being single, Ray compliments and kisses her. He thinks Denise has told Kim, so says Denise kissed him, leading to Kim and Denise falling out after Kim slaps her. Ray then ends his relationship with Kim, saying they are too different, but she continues to send text messages in the hope they will reconcile. Ray flirts with Kirsty Branning (Kierston Wareing), upsetting Kim. A few months later, Ray learns that Sasha's mother has been in an accident. Kim and Ray start talking when she asks a favour for her bed and breakfast, while he struggles to cope with caring for Sasha and working at the pub. Kim helps Ray by cooking him dinner, which leads to them kissing. They resume their relationship, but Ray decides to leave Walford and his job to be closer to Sasha. Kim agrees to come with him, but at her birthday party, she realises that Ray does not know her very well, so she breaks up with him moments before they are due to leave together, and Ray leaves alone.\n\nVenn heard from a friend that \"EastEnders\" were looking to cast Ray, and said that he thought \"I could play that guy!\" so contacted his agent to be put forward for the part. His agent told him that the producers were already interested in him for the part. Venn had previously worked with actor Jamie Foreman, who plays Derek Branning in the series, and when he discovered that Foreman was a part of the show, it made him more determined to get the part of Ray. He prepared 12 pages of his own back story for the character and imagined Ray's life as a child. Venn was eventually cast in the series, and was contracted for six months. Venn started filming in November 2011. The character and casting were then announced on 15 November 2011. Venn was a fan of \"EastEnders\" since he was about 12 years old, so he felt it was \"a real privilege to now be a part of television history.\" He said of his casting, \"I have had the pleasure of working on many great productions with fantastic artistes such as Morgan Freeman and I have to say working on \"EastEnders\" feels like it is up there with the best of them. \"EastEnders\" is etched in British history and it is an honour and a pleasure to be part of it.\" The first scenes that Venn filmed were with Shona McGarty (Whitney Dean), and Venn stated that it felt like \"the first day at school\".\n\nRay is a former army soldier, which Venn said taught him \"discipline and how to handle himself in certain situations.\" He also said it makes Ray \"strategic and tactical\". Venn hoped that Ray's army past would catch up with him in a storyline. Venn has described him as \"a noble fella\" and \"a man of principles [who] wants to honour his parental duties to the end, no matter what.\" He also said \"Ray's a very honourable man, and committed to his children.\" Additionally, when Venn auditioned for the part, the character was pitched to him as \"a charming family man and someone the ladies admire.\" Ray is described as \"a good guy\" who enjoys the gym, the pub and watching football matches. He had a hard childhood, but was loved by his mother and grandparents. From his grandmother he gained a love of Caribbean food and from his grandfather he took \"a special kind of optimism\". He got a girl from his estate pregnant before joining the army, which resulted in the birth of his daughter Sasha Dixon. Ray sees Sasha as \"being the best thing in his life, but he wishes her mother didn't exist.\" Ray works as a pub chef, which he has done in various cities. He has no problems with women but is described as \"a love 'em and leave 'em type.\" \"Inside Soap\" called him \"cocky\".\n\nRay and Bianca had a relationship when she was living in Manchester, and he fell in love with her but it ended when she met Tony King and stole money from Ray. Bianca never told Ray that she had become pregnant by him. A source from \"EastEnders\" confirmed: \"Ray hasn't seen Bianca for years and they didn't part on good terms. He meets Whitney as he has matters with Bianca that are unresolved. But Ray gets the shock of his life when Whitney tells him all about Morgan\u2014and she soon realises that Ray knew nothing about his son.\" Ray's introduction to \"EastEnders\" was said to fill \"another piece of the puzzle\" of Bianca's life, as previously nothing about Morgan's paternity was known. The relationship between Ray and Bianca was described as \"fraught\". Venn described the relationship as \"fiery\" and explained that Ray respects Bianca, and said that there was a possibility of them reuniting. Venn told \"All About Soap\" that when Ray meets Morgan for the first time, he has mixed emotions because although he has met his son, Morgan does not know who he is, and thinks he is meeting Barack Obama. Venn opined that it would be \"cathartic\" for Ray, saying he would be sad as he has missed out on seven years of Morgan's life, and said that when they first meet, \"it's a lovely moment [for] the two of them\". An \"EastEnders\" insider explained that Ray is desperate to be a part of Morgan's life, and would do whatever it takes to be with him, even move to Albert Square, where Morgan's family are. Venn opined that Ray would strive to be a good father, saying \"[he]'d take his parental responsibilities very seriously\". After Bianca goes to prison in May 2012, Venn told \"Inside Soap\" that \"Ray will do everything in his power to keep Morgan in his life\".\n\nDiscussing the storyline in which Ray asks Kim out on a date but she plays hard to get, an \"EastEnders\" insider told the \"Daily Star Sunday\" that \"Kim absolutely fancies the pants off Ray but she's got to calm herself down. She wants to get this one right so she decides the best way is to play hard to get. Ray sees straight through her and rather enjoys winding her up. She's a little firecracker as far as he's concerned and he likes it. These two are going to provide quite a bit of comedy as they get to know each other. Kim believes it's her destiny to have a fit man on her arm and she may well have met her match in Ray. It's going to be a fun few weeks for her and everyone is excited at the prospect of these two becoming a couple. They have real on-screen chemistry.\" Kim plays hard to get with Ray for a number of weeks, until Ray admits his feelings for her in scenes broadcast in April 2012. Up until then, they argue a lot, which a writer for \"All About Soap\" insisted was sexual tension. An \"EastEnders\" insider told \"Inside Soap\", \"Pairing up Kim and Ray initially creates fireworks of entirely the wrong kind! But there's definitely something there, and [their colleagues] can see plain as day that they're meant to be together.\" Venn said in May 2012 that pairing up Kim and Ray creates \"a dynamic comedic duo [which] brings comedic spice to the show.\"\n\nEmpson said in a May 2012 interview with \"Inside Soap\" that Kim did not consider Ray's children when she started flirting with him, but \"She's been very honest with him about her feelings. but if you really like somebody, then you have to take the whole package.\" She went on to say that Kim and Ray \"make a good couple\" and that \"Kim wants a bit of security, and her own family. Ray's a man's man, and she really thinks he could be a long-term love for her. That's why she did things differently with him, and didn't rush in. [...] With Ray, she's keeping her cards very close to her chest.\" Continuing, she explained that Ray is \"something different\" for Kim because he's \"a decent guy\", adding \"I think she and Ray really complement each other\u2014he's livened up a bit by her, while she learns a lot from him.\" Finally, she said that Ray likes that Kim is \"her own woman. So together they made a really good team. Someone once said that Kim and Ray are like the Posh and Becks of Walford.\" Venn said that he thought it was \"nice\" for Ray to propose marriage to Kim, saying, \"I imagine they would have a conventional wedding, then a reception with 70s fancy dress. [...] I'm sure nothing would be straightforward.\" He also said he would like to see them have a baby together, as it would be \"interesting to see how Kim tackled being a mother.\" Empson said that if they were to get engaged, Kim would need a big ring, and Venn teased that Ray may have got the ring, since viewers were to see \"the other side of Ray\".\n\nIn December 2012, pictures emerged in the press of Ray kissing Kim's sister Denise Fox (Diane Parish). It was unknown at the time if it would lead to a relationship or remain a one-off. Venn praised the storyline, saying \"Obviously it's about layers and showing the different sides of my character, so for me, this is a wonderful challenge. As an actor, I love challenges so I'm looking forward to seeing how this storyline develops. I think Kim would be quite peeved if she found out!\" Venn explained Ray's reasons for kissing Denise, saying, \"Ray reaches a point where he needs to come up for a breath of air, as there's only so much of Kim's heightened personality he can bear. Did Ray go for the wrong sister? Who knows? He probably has more in common with Denise than he ever had with Kim.\" He said that he felt bad about Ray kissing Denise because he is close to Empson and her character has been Ray's partner for about 10 to 11 months, and said it was \"really weird\" to film the kiss with Denise. The kiss, shown in January 2013, leads to Ray and Kim's relationship ending.\n\nIn an early storyline, Ray takes a disliking to Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) when he stores illegal alcohol in the basement of The Queen Victoria. In May 2012, Venn opined that tension between Derek and Ray \"could come to a head at some point soon. There's only so much one man can take, especially when it comes to racial abuse. [Ray will] know exactly when to attack, and won't hold back.\" Venn also said he could imagine Sasha's mother appearing on screen, saying, \"\"EastEnders\" likes to keep you guessing, and I think that's a storyline with legs.\"\n\nIn June 2012, it was announced that Kat Moon, played by Jessie Wallace, would embark on a long-running mystery affair with another Albert Square resident. The identity of the mystery man was kept secret from both cast and crew, as well as viewers, and all scenes of Kat with her lover were filmed with an extra. After the storyline was announced, Ray was announced as one of five suspects as potential love interests for Kat, along with, Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd), Max Branning (Jake Wood), Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) and Jack Branning (Scott Maslen). Speaking of the storyline, executive producer Lorraine Newman said: \"The consequences are not only great for Kat and Alfie, but also for each individual suspect. The audience will join the cast and crew guessing across the summer and autumn as we eliminate the suspects one at a time, leading to one almighty explosion.\" Asked about the possibility that Ray could be Kat's lover, Venn said that \"Kat's a saucy minx, and what man wouldn't want to get involved with her? Ray is a loyal, caring father\u2014but we all have our dark sides. There's a lot the audience hasn't seen yet, put it that way.\" Daniel Kilkelly from entertainment website Digital Spy said that Ray appears to be a \"decent family guy\" and may not be the top suspect, but he is very flirtatious and his chef's job in The Queen Victoria, where Kat is landlady, would give him the perfect opportunity. However, he questioned the likelihood of Ray cheating on Kim. Ray was eliminated as a suspect in the episode broadcast on 7 August 2012, when he catches Kat on the phone to her lover.\n\nIn September 2012, viewers see Ray become a victim of racial profiling by the police, and Kim suggests that Ray channel his negativity into mentoring youths. Venn spoke on \"This Morning\", confirming that Ray would indeed start such a scheme. Venn praised the storyline and the fact that the character could show a more serious side, saying, \"For me, of course, I was very impressed by \"EastEnders\" for even making the choice to tackle such a pertinent, very relevant issue. It felt very close to my heart.\" He went on to say that Ray would \"help empower [youths], so they can equip themselves in situations similar to that\u2014[to have] a bit more self-respect, know how to carry themselves and not deal with it in a violent or aggressive manner.\" Venn then stated that the storyline could establish Ray as \"a more well-rounded character\", saying, \"It's about levels. There's different sides to every individual. It's nice that \"EastEnders\" have given me the opportunity to allow Ray to show the other sides. It just shows versatility.\"\n\nOn 16 April 2013, it was announced that Venn was leaving the show, with Ray making his final appearance in May, as producers had decided to write him out. Venn stated: \"Working on \"EastEnders\" has been one of my career highlights and an invaluable experience. I couldn't have asked for a better team to work with and have found a lifelong friend in my on-screen partner Tameka [Empson]. I want to thank everyone who supported me on the show.\"\n\nInitial praise for Ray was based on his looks. A writer for \"All About Soap\" magazine described Ray as \"hunky\", \"good-looking\" and said that \"this mysterious man might have everything going for him.\" Laura Morgan of \"All About Soap\" said that Ray's inclusion \"ticks the hunky-man box very nicely\". In a feature about \"the boys of soapland who'll be lighting up our screens in the coming months\", a writer for \"Inside Soap\" said in May 2012, \"It's rare to meet a truly good man in soap. They generally come laden with baggage, burdened with dark secrets and\u2014almost always\u2014have the same attitude to monogamy as a cocker spaniel on heat. But Ray seems to be cut from a different cloth, and we love him for it.\"\n\nIn May 2012, Venn was nominated in the Best Newcomer category at the 2012 TVChoice Awards for his portrayal of Ray, but was not shortlisted for the award. He was then nominated in July 2012 for Best Newcomer at the 2012 Inside Soap awards.\n\n", "links": [[[55, 58], "BBC"], [[59, 69], "soap opera"], [[71, 81], "EastEnders"], [[94, 105], "Chucky Venn"],

{"id": 6101414, "title": "Hearts and Flowers", "text": "Hearts and Flowers\n\n\"Hearts and Flowers\" (subtitle: \"A New Flower Song\") is a song composed by Theodore Moses-Tobani (with words by Mary D. Brine) and published in 1893 by Carl Fischer Music.\n\nThe famous melody is taken from the introductory 2/4 section of \"\"Winterm\u00e4rchen\" Waltzes Op. 366\" (1891) by the Hungarian composer Alphons Czibulka. Tobani arranged the piece in a 4/4 song form as \"Hearts and Flowers, a New Flower Song, Op. 245.\" The song as a vocal number was soon forgotten but the instrumental version gained popularity in its own right and it is in this form that it remains well known to this day. Tobani also arranged the tune as a waltz, featured in a medley published in 1900 entitled \"Beauties Charms,\" although this arrangement is now seldom heard.\n\n\"Hearts and Flowers\" has an association in popular culture as melodramatic photoplay music. The practice of using the selection as a dramatic cue is documented as early as 1911, although complaints that the tune was becoming overplayed crop up as early as 1913 and 1914, and by 1915, the piece was being called \"time worn\".\n\nSoon thereafter, \"Hearts and Flowers\" (along with Gustav Lange's \"Flower Song\") became more commonly associated with underscoring an over-the-top parody of melodrama in film. Around 1919, musical accompaniment cue sheets start suggesting the tune \"a la burlesque\" to mock-dramatic scenes. Even into the late 1920s, \"Hearts and Flowers\" continued to be suggested as a burlesque dramatic piece.\n\n\"Hearts and Flowers\" was not only heard in theater as accompaniment to films, but played an integral part of on-set music for actors. Viola Dana famously requested the tune to be played in order for her to generate enough emotion for her to cry real tears. This was later parodied in the 1928 film \"Show People\" with Marion Davies.\n\nThe term 'hearts-and-flowers' has entered the English language with the sense \"extreme sentimentality, cloying sweetness\".\n\nThere is a reference to \"Hearts and Flowers\" in \"Amazing Spider-Man\" #45, published February, 1967.\n\n", "links": [[[95, 116], "Theodore Moses-Tobani"], [[164, 168], "1893 in

{"id": 23024, "title": "Foreign relations of Poland", "text": "Foreign relations of Poland\n\nThe Republic of Poland is a Central European country and member of the European Union and NATO, among others. Poland wields considerable influence in Central and Eastern Europe and is a middle power in international affairs. The foreign policy of Poland is based on four basic commitments: to Atlantic co-operation, to European integration, to international development and to international law.\n\nThe Polish economy is fairly open and relies strongly on international trade. Since the collapse of communism and its re-establishment as a democratic nation, Poland has extended its responsibilities and position in European and Western affairs, supporting and establishing friendly foreign relations with both the West and with numerous European countries.\n\nAfter regaining independence in 1989, Poland has forged ahead on its economic reintegration with the Western world. Poland also has been an active nation in advocating European integration.\n\nIn 1994, Poland became an associate member of the European Union (EU) and its defensive arm, the Western European Union (WEU). In 1996, Poland achieved full OECD membership and submitted preliminary documentation for full EU membership. In 1997, Poland was invited in the first wave of NATO policy enlargement at the July 1997 NATO Summit in Madrid, Spain. In March 1999, Poland became a full member of NATO. Poland promoted its NATO candidacy through energetic participation in the Partnership for Peace (PfP) program and through intensified individual dialogue with NATO. Poland formally joined the European Union in May 2004, along with the other members of the Visegr\u00e1d group.\n\nPoland was a part of the multinational force in Iraq.\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union led to the establishment of seven new sovereign states in Poland's immediate neighborhood (Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia), of which Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia (through the Kaliningrad Oblast) border Poland. Poland has actively pursued good relations with all its neighboring countries, signing friendship treaties replacing links severed by the collapse of the Warsaw Pact. The Poles have forged special relationships with Lithuania and particularly Ukraine in an effort to firmly anchor these states to the West.\n\nDue to its tragic historical experience with aggression of powerful neighbors (e.g., Partitions of Poland, Second World War), Polish foreign policy pursues close cooperation with a strong partner, one apt enough to give strong military support in times of critical situations. This creates the background of Poland's tight relations with the USA and their sensitivity in relations towards its partner within the European Union, Germany. At the same time, the equally burdened attitude towards Russia results in very tense diplomatic relations, which have been constantly worsening since Vladimir Putin's rise to power. This is an important factor for the special attention Poland pays to the political emancipation of all its Eastern neighbors: Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine.\n\n\n", "links": [[[33, 51], "Poland"],

It debuted May 19 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, reaching the top of the chart on October 6. The song was produced by George Tobin in association with Mike Piccirillo.\n\n\"Sad Eyes\" is one of just a few non-disco, or disco-influenced, songs to top the 1979 pop chart, although by then the anti-disco backlash had made it easier for other styles to reach the top. It is also notable as the song that ended the six-week reign of the biggest smash hit of the year, The Knack's \"My Sharona.\"\n\nAlbum credits list these musicians involved during the sessions from which \"Sad Eyes\" was recorded. \n\nA cover by American country music group Trader-Price peaked at number 55 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Singles chart in 1989. Kyle Vincent also recorded the song, released on \"Absolutely The Best of the 70s\", credited to Bo Donaldson and The Heywoods, and produced by Ron Dante.

{"id": 1203988, "title": "Rock of the Westies", "text": "Rock of the Westies\n\nRock of the Westies is the tenth studio album by English musician Elton John, released in October 1975. As with \"Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy\", \"Rock of the Westies\" debuted on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart at No. 1, the only two albums at that time to have done so. It was also successful (albeit to a lesser extent) in the artist's home territory of the UK, where it reached No. 5 on the UK Albums Chart. Robert Christgau ranked it as No. 7 on his list of the best albums of 1975. The title is a spoonerism play on the phrase \"West of the Rockies\", the album having been recorded at Caribou Ranch in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado.\n\n\"Rock of the Westies\" contained the US No. 1 (#14 UK) single, \"Island Girl\", which was released prior to the album. John noted at the time in a radio interview that he had wanted to release \"Dan Dare (Pilot of the Future)\" as the album's first single instead of \"Island Girl\", because he thought it had more commercial appeal. He was over-ruled, and \"Dan Dare\" was never released as a single, whilst \"Island Girl\" became a hit.\n\nThe make-up of John's band was different on \"Rock of the Westies\", being without his long-time drummer Nigel Olsson and bassist Dee Murray, both of whom John fired during April 1975. Added in their place were drummer Roger Pope, an old friend who had played on \"Empty Sky\", \"Tumbleweed Connection\" and \"Madman Across the Water\", and American bassist Kenny Passarelli, who had previously played with Stephen Stills and was an original member in Joe Walsh's band Barnstorm. Pope had also played in Kiki Dee's touring band. Grammy, Emmy, and Academy Award-nominated James Newton-Howard, at the time a virtual unknown, was also brought in as keyboardist, giving him his first major publicity. Also included was Caleb Quaye, another old friend from his early DJM session days. Like Pope, Quaye had also played on \"Empty Sky\" & \"Tumbleweed Connection\" & also John's intervening eponymous release. Retained from the previous line-up were Davey Johnstone and Ray Cooper.\n\nA slower, less up-tempo version of \"Hard Luck Story\" had already been recorded by Kiki Dee (whom the song was originally written for), and released as a single one year prior to its recording for \"Rock of the Westies\". Along with \"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\", it is credited to Ann Orson/Carte Blanche (An 'orse an' cart / 'carte blanche') a punning moniker John devised when composing a song (music and lyrics) on his own. The name Ann Orson is also used as the name of a backing vocalist. Labelle performed backing vocals on the opening track, \"Medley: Yell Help/Wednesday Night/Ugly\".\n\nIn the US, it was certified gold in October 1975 and platinum in March 1993 by the RIAA.\n\nOutside the US and Canada, this was the last original studio release from John on DJM Records, before forming his own label, The Rocket Record Company.\n\nThe song \"Street Kids\" was featured in the 2008 video game \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\n\nAll songs written by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, except where noted. \u201cAnn Orson/Carte Blanche\u201d is a pseudonym used by John and Taupin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack numbers refer to CD and digital releases of the album.\n\nProduction\n", "links": [[[87, 97], "Elton John"], [[134, 177], "Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy"], [[220, 235], "Billboard 200"], [[425, 440], "UK Albums Chart"], [[442, 458], "Robert Christgau"], [[533, 543], "spoonerism"], [[641, 656], "Rocky Mountains"], [[734, 745], "Island Girl"], [[1203, 1215], "Nigel Olsson"], [[1228, 1238], "Dee Murray"], [[1362, 1371], "Empty Sky"], [[1375, 1396], "Tumbleweed Connection"], [[1403, 1426], "Madman Across the Water"], [[1450, 1466], "Kenny Passarelli"], [[1499, 1513], "Stephen Stills"], [[1544, 1553], "Joe Walsh"], [[1561, 1570], "Barnstorm (band)"], [[1596, 1604], "Kiki Dee"], [[1621, 1627], "Grammy Award"], [[1629, 1633], "Emmy Award"], [[1639, 1652], "Academy Award"], [[1663, 1682], "James Newton-Howard"], [[1807, 1818], "Caleb Quaye"], [[2031, 2046], "Davey Johnstone"], [[2051, 2061], "Ray Cooper"], [[2295, 2321], "Don't Go Breaking My Heart"], [[2555, 2562], "Labelle"], [[2736, 2740], "Recording Industry Association of America"], [[2868, 2893], "The Rocket Record Company"], [[2956, 2975], "Grand Theft Auto IV"], [[3000, 3010], "Elton John"], [[3015, 3028], "Bernie Taupin"]], "title_synonyms": [[21, 40]], "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1203988", "evaluation_span": [2653, 2977], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [2656, 2662], "entity_id": "Q30", "name": "United States of America", "parent": null, "children": [1], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 1, "span": [2660, 2662], "entity_id": "Q30", "name": "United States of America", "parent": 0, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 2, "span": [2664, 2666], "entity_id": "Q1754356", "name": "Rock of the Westies", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q17537576", "level1": true}, {"id": 3, "span": [2689, 2701], "entity_id": "DATETIME", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "DATETIME", "level1": null}, {"id": 4, "span": [2718, 2728], "entity_id": "DATETIME", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "DATETIME", "level1": null}, {"id": 5, "span": [2736, 2740], "entity_id": "Q200863", "name": "Recording Industry Association of America", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 6, "span": [2751, 2757], "entity_id": "Q30", "name": "United States of America", "parent": null, "children": [7], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 7, "span": [2755, 2757], "entity_id": "Q30", "name": "United States of America", "parent": 6, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 8, "span": [2762, 2768], "entity_id": "Q16", "name": "Canada", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 9, "span": [2770, 2774], "entity_id": "Q1754356", "name": "Rock of the Westies", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q17537576", "level1": true}, {"id": 10, "span": [2817, 2821], "entity_id": "Q2808", "name": "Elton John", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q18336849", "level1": true}, {"id": 11, "span": [2825, 2836], "entity_id": "Q543391", "name": "DJM Records", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q17537576|Q431289|Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 12, "span": [2853, 2856], "entity_id": "Q2808", "name": "Elton John", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q18336849", "level1": true}, {"id": 13, "span": [2868, 2893], "entity_id": "Q3939773", "name": "The Rocket Record Company", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q17537576|Q431289|Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 14, "span": [2906, 2917], "entity_id": "Unknown1", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "OTHER", "level1": null}, {"id": 15, "span": [2939, 2943], "entity_id": "DATETIME", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "DATETIME", "level1": null}, {"id": 16, "span": [2956, 2975], "entity_id": "Q94797", "name": "Grand Theft Auto IV", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q17537576|Q2424752", "level1": true}]}

{"id": 5724586, "title": "Forage War", "text": "Forage War\n\nThe Forage War was a partisan campaign consisting of numerous small skirmishes that took place in New Jersey during the American Revolutionary War between January and March 1777, following the battles of Trenton and Princeton. After both British and Continental Army troops entered their winter quarters in early January, Continental Army regulars and militia companies from New Jersey and Pennsylvania engaged in numerous scouting and harassing operations against the British and German troops quartered in New Jersey.\n\nThe British troops wanted to have fresh provisions to consume, and also required fresh forage for their draft animals and horses. General George Washington ordered the systematic removal of such supplies from areas easily accessible to the British, and companies of American militia and troops harassed British and German forays to acquire such provisions. While many of these operations were small, in some cases they became quite elaborate, involving more than 1,000 troops. The American operations were so successful that British casualties in New Jersey (including those of the battles at Trenton and Princeton) exceeded those of the entire campaign for New York.\n\nIn August 1776 the British army began a campaign to gain control over New York City, which was defended by George Washington's Continental Army. Over the next two months, General William Howe quickly gained control of New York, pushing Washington into New Jersey. He then chased Washington south toward Philadelphia. Washington retreated across the Delaware River into Pennsylvania, taking with him all the boats for miles in each direction. Howe then ordered his army into winter quarters, establishing a chain of outposts across New Jersey, from the Hudson River through New Brunswick to Trenton and Bordentown on the Delaware River. The occupation of New Jersey by British and German troops caused friction with the local communities and led to a rise in Patriot militia enlistments. As early as mid-December, these militia companies were harassing British patrols, leading to incidents like Geary's ambush, in which a dragoon leader was killed, and increasing the level of tension in the British and German quarters.\n\nOn the night of December\u00a025\u201326, 1776, Washington crossed the Delaware and surprised the Trenton outpost the following morning, December 26. Over the next two weeks, he went on to win two further battles at Assunpink Creek and Battle of Princeton, leading the British to retreat to northern New Jersey. This period, from December 25, 1776, through January 3, 1777, has become known as the Ten Crucial Days.\n\nGeneral Washington established his headquarters at Morristown, separated from the coast by the Watchung Mountains, a series of low ridges. He established forward outposts to the east and south of these ridges that served not only as a defensive bulwark against potential British incursions across the hills, but also as launch points for raids. Over the course of January and February, Washington's Continental Army shrank to about 2,500 regulars after Washington's incentives for many men to overstay their enlistment periods ran out. A large number of militia from New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania bolstered these forces, and played a significant role that winter.\n\nThe British army was initially deployed from posts as far north as Hackensack to New Brunswick. The garrison, numbering about 10,000, was concentrated between New Brunswick and Amboy, with a sizable contingent farther north, from Elizabethtown to Paulus Hook. Militia pressure in January led General Cornwallis to withdraw most of the northern troops to the shores of the Hudson. The resulting concentration of troops overflowed the available housing, which had been entirely abandoned by its residents, with some of the troops even living aboard ships anchored nearby; the cramped quarters led to an increase in camp-related illnesses throughout the winter, and morale was low. The area had been heavily plundered during the American retreat in the fall, so there was little in the way of local provisions. The men subsisted largely on rations such as salt pork, but their draft animals required fresh fodder, for which they sent out raiding expeditions.\n\nEarly in the winter, Washington sent out detachments of troops to systematically remove any remaining provisions and livestock from convenient access by the British. General Cornwallis sent out small foraging and raiding parties in January. These were met by larger formations (numbering 300 and up) of American militia companies, sometimes with Continental Army support, that led on occasion to significant casualties. In one early example, Brigadier General Philemon Dickinson mustered 450 militia and drove off a British foraging expedition in the Battle of Millstone on January 20. Washington gave his commanders wide latitude in how to act, issuing commands that they were to be \"constantly harassing the enemy\", and that they should be aggressive in their tactics. These early successes depended in part on successful intelligence; one British commander reported being met with force \"notwithstanding the Orders were given, but a few hours before the Troops moved.\" Even supply convoys bringing provisions from outside the state to the large garrison at New Brunswick were not immune to the American attacks, where the Raritan River and the roads from Perth Amboy offered opportunities for sniping and raiding. Their difficulties led British commanders to change tactics, attempting to lure these militia units into traps involving larger numbers of British regulars.\n\nBut even this was not entirely successful, as wily militia and Continental commanders including Continental Army General William Maxwell used superior knowledge of the geography to set even more elaborate traps. In one encounter in late February, British Colonel Charles Mawhood, thinking he had flanked a party of New Jersey militia, suddenly found his advance force flanked by another, larger force. As they were driven back toward Amboy, more and more Americans appeared, ultimately inflicting about 100 casualties. The elite grenadiers of the 42nd Foot, part of Mawhood's vanguard, were badly mauled in the encounter. A British force of 2,000 was repulsed by Maxwell in another well-organized attack a few weeks later.\n\nThe ongoing tensions took their toll on the beleaguered British. Johann Ewald, captain of a company of German j\u00e4gers (essentially light infantry) who were often on the front lines, observed that \"the men have to stay dressed day and night ... the horses constantly saddled\", and that \"the army would have been gradually destroyed through this foraging\". Some forage was provided from New York, but it was never sufficient for the army's needs. As a consequence, the British were forced to provide many supplies from Europe, at great cost and risk to the Royal Navy.\n\nA regiment of Waldeck infantry, a few companies of the 71st Foot and a troop of British light dragoons were stationed at Elizabethtown, New Jersey in the winter of 1776\u20131777. On 5 January 1777, a British cavalry patrol was ambushed by militia near the town. One trooper was killed and a second was wounded. The next day, about 50 Waldeck infantry emerged from the town with a small escort of light dragoons with instructions to clear the country. Led by Captain Georg von Haacke, the strong patrol was attacked near Springfield by New Jersey militia. In Elizabethtown, the soldiers heard distant gunfire. Hours later the bedraggled British horsemen came back without the foot soldiers. Eight or 10 of the Waldeckers were shot down and the entire party captured by the militia. Ordered to pull back to Amboy, the garrison hurriedly left on 7 January. As the troops evacuated Elizabethtown, the militia attacked the rear guard. In the confused retreat, the Americans captured 100 soldiers, the baggage trains of two regiments, and food supplies. \n\nOn 10 January 1777, Colonel Charles Scott's Virginia Continentals captured 70 Highlanders together with their wagons at Chatham, New Jersey. Scott's brigade was composed of the 4th, 5th and 6th Virginia Regiments. At Connecticut Farms on 15 January, 300 New Jersey militia commanded by Colonel Oliver Spencer attacked 100 German foragers. The Americans killed one enemy soldier and captured 70 more. The following day, 350 Americans set upon a large body of British foragers at Bonhamtown, New Jersey, killing 21 enemy soldiers and wounding 30 or 40 more. American casualties are not given in any of these actions. \n\nAt the Battle of Millstone, Brigadier General Philemon Dickinson of the New Jersey militia scored a brilliant success. On 20 January 1777 near Van Nest's Mill, 400 militia and 50 Pennsylvania riflemen crossed an icy stream and fought a pitched battle with 500 British regulars and three cannons. The British lost 25 casualties, 12 prisoners, 43 wagons, 104 horses, 115 cattle and about 60 sheep. The Americans admitted losses of four or five men. Afterward, the British refused to believe that they had been beaten by militia. On 23 January two British regiments were waylaid by Brigadier General William Maxwell near Woodbridge. The 200 New Jersey Continentals inflicted losses of seven killed and 12 wounded while only suffering two men wounded.\n\nOn 1 February 1777, Brigadier General Sir William Erskine, 1st Baronet set up a clever trap. He sent a party of foragers to Drake's Farm near Metuchen. When Scott's 5th Virginia tried to gobble up the small party, Erskine rushed his large force into action. Battalions of grenadiers, light infantry, 42nd Foot and Hessians appeared, supported by eight artillery pieces. Instead of fleeing, the Virginians launched a vicious attack which momentarily broke a grenadier battalion. Under intense cannon fire, the American attack was stopped, but the soldiers fought tenaciously until the British fell back toward Brunswick. The Americans admitted 30 to 40 casualties while claiming to have killed 36 British and wounding 100 more. The action was marred by an ugly incident when Lieutenant William Kelly and six other wounded Americans were abandoned during a tactical withdrawal. The frustrated British fell upon the seven helpless men with bayonets and musket butts and slaughtered them all. When the Americans recovered the mangled bodies they were infuriated. Brigadier General Adam Stephen exchanged a series of irate letters with Erskine, who denied all responsibility for the incident. \n\nOn February 8, 1777, General Cornwallis, with six British generals commanding a force of twelve battalions, about 2,000 troops, planned to attack the American militia, led by Colonel Charles Scott and the 5th Virginia Regiment, and Continentals led by Brigadier General Nathaniel Warner at Quibbletown, New Jersey, now New Market. However, the Americans refused to directly engage this foraging party, but attacked the flanks and rear as the British retreated to New Brunswick. Historian Fischer writes: \"The British commanders were outgeneraled in the field.\" Hessian Captain Johann von Ewald described the events in his diary and notes that \"Since the army would have been gradually destroyed through this foraging, from here on the forage was procured from New York\". Other skirmishes occurred in this area on February 20, March 8, and April 4.\n\nOn 23 February 1777, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Mawhood was sent with a reinforced brigade to destroy any rebel forces he could catch. He set out with a battalion each of light infantry and grenadiers, plus the 3rd Brigade. The latter formation consisted of the 10th Foot, 37th Foot, 38th Foot and 52nd Foot, recently transferred from the Rhode Island garrison. Near Spanktown, now Rahway, New Jersey, Mawhood found a group of militia herding some livestock covered by a larger body of Americans waiting on a nearby hill. The British officer sent the grenadier company of the 42nd Foot on a wide flanking maneuver. Just as the grenadiers prepared to launch their assault, they were fired on from ambush and routed with the loss of 26 men. At this moment, Maxwell sent his superior force forward to envelop Mawhood's force. The American force included the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th New Jersey Regiments, the 1st and 8th Pennsylvania Regiments, and the German Battalion. Mawhood's surprised men were hounded all the way back to Amboy, which they reached at 8:00 PM. The Americans lost 5 killed and 9 wounded, and claimed to have inflicted 100 casualties. Mawhood admitted losing 69 killed and wounded and 6 missing.\n\nHistorian David Hackett Fischer compiled a list that he describes as \"incomplete\", consisting of 58 actions that occurred between January 4 and March 21, 1777. The documented British and German casualties numbered more than 900; a number of the events do not include any casualty reports. Combined with their losses at Trenton and Princeton, the British lost more men in New Jersey than they did during the campaign for New York City. Fischer does not estimate American casualties, and other historians (e.g. Ketchum and Mitnick) have not compiled any casualty estimates. Fischer notes that relatively few official reports of American (either militia or Continental Army) unit strengths for this time period have survived.\n\nThe 1777 military campaigns began to take shape in April. General Charles Cornwallis punctuated the winter skirmishes with an attack on the Continental Army outpost at Bound Brook on April\u00a013. In the Battle of Bound Brook, he very nearly captured its commander, Benjamin Lincoln. Outnumbering the Americans 2,000 to 500, the British scattered the militia but met stubborn resistance from the 8th Pennsylvania Regiment. The British captured three 3-pound guns and 20 or 30 men and killed six Americans, but the bulk of Lincoln's force got away. General Washington moved his army from its winter quarters at Morristown to a more forward position at Middlebrook in late May to better react to British moves. As General Howe prepared his Philadelphia campaign, he first moved a large portion of his army to Somerset Court House in mid-June, apparently in an attempt to draw Washington from the Middlebrook position. When this failed, Howe withdrew his army back to Perth Amboy, and embarked it on ships bound for the Chesapeake Bay. Northern and coastal New Jersey continued to be the site of skirmishing and raiding by the British forces that occupied New York City for the rest of the war.\n\n", "links": [[[33, 41], "partisan

{"id": 47717083, "title": "Greg Whittington", "text": "Greg Whittington\n\nGreg Whittington (born February 7, 1993) is an American professional basketball player who last played for Galatasaray Do\u011fa Sigorta of the Basketbol S\u00fcper Ligi. After a tumultuous college career with Georgetown, Whittington began his professional career by helping the Sioux Falls Skyforce win the 2016 NBA D-League championship. He went on to play in Australia, Japan, Israel and Turkey.\n\nWhittington attended Oakland Mills High School in Columbia, Maryland where he was a four-year letterwinner playing for the basketball team. As a senior in 2010\u201311, he averaged 23.5 points, 11.6 rebounds, 4.4 blocks, 3.0 steals and 2.7 assists per game, while earning All-Met Player of the Year and Howard County Player of the Year honors for leading his team to an undefeated season, finishing 25\u20130.\n\nAs a freshman at Georgetown in 2011\u201312, Whittington appeared in all 33 games while averaging 4.3 points and 2.9 rebounds in 20.1 minutes per game. His sophomore season was cut short in January 2013 after being suspended for academic deficiencies. He averaged 12.1 points and 7.0 rebounds in 13 games.\n\nWhittington failed to appear in any games for the Hoyas in the 2013\u201314 season due to a torn ACL suffered during the summer, as he was dismissed from the team on November 30, 2013. He subsequently transferred to Rutgers University, only to go back on his commitment by not enrolling for the spring semester with no comment given on his decision not to join the school. Whittington subsequently sat out the entire 2013\u201314 season.\n\nWhittington sat out the entire 2014\u201315 season while still recovering from his ACL injury. He spent time working out with the Westchester Knicks of the NBA Development League.\n\nIn May and June 2015, Whittington took part in pre-draft workouts with the Indiana Pacers and the Boston Celtics. He ultimately went undrafted in the 2015 NBA draft and joined the Miami Heat for the 2015 NBA Summer League, playing in both Orlando and Las Vegas. In nine games, he averaged 9.1 points, 6.2 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 1.4 steals and 1.3 blocks per game. He later joined the Heat for training camp and appeared in four preseason games.\n\nOn November 2, 2015, Whittington was acquired by the Sioux Falls Skyforce of the NBA Development League as an affiliate player of the Heat. He appeared in all 10 games for the Skyforce to begin the season, helping them to a 7\u20133 record while averaging 15.2 points, 9.3 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 2.4 steals per game. However, a hand injury suffered in mid-December saw him miss two months of action. The Skyforce finished the regular season with a league-best 40\u201310 record, going on to reach the D-League Finals, where they defeated the Los Angeles D-Fenders 2\u20131 to claim their first D-League championship. In game two, Whittington scored a team-high 17 points. In 34 games (27 regular season, 7 playoff) for the Skyforce in 2015\u201316, he averaged 13.5 points, 7.6 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 1.9 steals and 1.0 blocks per game. At the season's end, he earned NBA D-League All-Rookie Team honors.\n\nIn the 2016 off-season, Whittington decided against participating in Summer League activities and instead went home to Maryland to work out with his local counterparts. Such players included NBA stars Victor Oladipo and Jerami Grant.\n\nOn August 13, 2016, Whittington signed with the Sydney Kings for the 2016\u201317 NBL season. He made his debut for the Kings in their season opener on October 8, 2016, but struggled to make an impact offensively in 24 minutes due to foul trouble. He finished with six points, four rebounds, two assists, two steals and three blocks in a 77\u201373 loss to the Brisbane Bullets. In the Kings' fourth game of the season on October 20, Whittington scored a season-high 22 points in a 92\u201378 win over the New Zealand Breakers. On November 5, he had a season-high 16 rebounds in a 64\u201357 loss to the Cairns Taipans. He appeared in all 28 games for the Kings and averaged 11.5 points, 6.4 rebounds, 1.8 assists and 1.5 steals per game. The Kings missed the playoffs in 2016\u201317 with a 13\u201315 record.\n\nOn February 21, 2017, Whittington was reacquired by the Sioux Falls Skyforce. In nine games for the Skyforce to finish the 2016\u201317 season, he averaged 13.6 points, 5.7 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 1.0 steals per game.\n\nOn July 28, 2017, Whittington signed with Levanga Hokkaido of the Japanese B.League. He left the team in January 2018 after averaging 11.0 points, 6.1 rebounds and 1.8 assists in 18 games.\n\nOn September 20, 2018, Whittington signed a one-year deal with Hapoel Gilboa Galil of the Israeli Premier League. On April 15, 2019, Whittington recorded a career-high 29 points, shooting 10-of-17 from the field, along with 14 rebounds, 5 assists and 2 blocks in a 96\u201393 win over Ironi Nahariya. He was subsequently named Israeli League Round 27 MVP. In 30 games played for Gilboa Gali, he led the league in efficiency rating (24.6) and rebounds (9.6). He also finished as the third-leading scorer (18.4), while shooting 41.5 percent from three-point range.\n\nOn August 12, 2019, Whittington signed with Galatasaray Do\u011fa Sigorta of the Basketbol S\u00fcper Ligi. He left the team in January 2020. In 14 league games, he averaged 12.4 points, 4.9 rebounds, 1.6 assists and 1.0 steals per game. He also averaged 12.5 points, 6.4 rebounds, 1.5 assists and 1.3 steals in 11 Eurocup games.\n\nWhittington is the son of the late Gregory and Jana Lisa Whittington, and has an older sister, Hana, and a younger brother, Cortez. His father died in 2016 after a long battle with cancer.\n\n", "links": [[[87, 97], "basketball"], [[125, 149], "Galatasaray S.K.

{"id": 6907593, "title": "WFGI-FM", "text": "WFGI-FM\n\nWFGI-FM, known as \"Froggy 95 FM\", is a Froggy branded Country music formatted radio station in Pennsylvania serving the Johnstown area. The station is owned and operated by Forever Broadcasting, LLC.\n\nThe station began at 96.5 (now WKYE) as WJNL-FM in the 1970s as the sister station to WJNL. They played easy to listen to music and had news updates hourly. It was known as this until it was purchased in 1996 by Clear Channel Communications. When it became 96.5 the mountain with the callsign WMTZ and began playing country music. In 2005, Clear Channel decided to leave the Johnstown market and sold its station properties to Altoona-based Forever Broadcasting. Forever wanted to expand its Froggyland into the Pittsburgh area and the 96.5 signal was not able to do so. The 95.5 signal was able to with no problem, so in February 2005 the station became Froggy 95 (as it is still today).\n\nWFGI-FM has a very strong signal that can be heard as far west as western suburbs of Pittsburgh and even eastern Ohio and as far east as Mifflin County, where it starts conflicting with WMRF on 95.7 FM from Lewistown. In recent years however the coverage area has faded, due to short space same and adjacent stations (e.g. WZWW on 95.3 FM from Bellefonte) and also weather conditions having effect on coverage presumably from flora.\n\nWFGI-FM has always suffered from signal degradation in the city of license, primarily because of the excessive height above the city as well as multipath caused by the local terrain of the Allegheny plateau. There are multiple areas in Johnstown that cause that station to have multipath.\n\n\n40.372\u00b0N 78.982\u00b0W\n", "links": [[[48, 62], "Froggy (brand)"], [[63, 76], "Country music"], [[87, 100], "radio station"], [[104, 116], "Pennsylvania"], [[129, 138], "Johnstown, Pennsylvania"], [[241, 245], "WKYE"], [[422, 450], "Clear Channel Communications"], [[526, 539], "country music"], [[1086, 1090], "WMRF"], [[1223, 1227], "WZWW"]], "title_synonyms": [[9, 16]], "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6907593", "evaluation_span": [900, 1643], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [900, 907], "entity_id": "Q7949281", "name": "WFGI-FM", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 1, "span": [985, 995], "entity_id": "Q1342", "name": "Pittsburgh", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 2, "span": [1013, 1017], "entity_id": "Q1397", "name": "Ohio", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 3, "span": [1037, 1051], "entity_id": "Q494161", "name": "Mifflin County", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213", "level1": true}, {"id": 4, "span": [1086, 1090], "entity_id": "Q7953029", "name": "WMRF-FM", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 5, "span": [1094, 1098], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "QUANTITY", "level1": null}, {"id": 6, "span": [1107, 1116], "entity_id": "Q1184736", "name": "Lewistown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 7, "span": [1223, 1227], "entity_id": "Q7958425", "name": "WZWW", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 8, "span": [1231, 1235], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "QUANTITY", "level1": null}, {"id": 9, "span": [1244, 1254], "entity_id": "Q1133274", "name": "Bellefonte", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 10, "span": [1334, 1341], "entity_id": "Q7949281", "name": "WFGI-FM", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 11, "span": [1389, 1408], "entity_id": "Q1070763", "name": "Johnstown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 12, "span": [1458, 1466], "entity_id": "Q1070763", "name": "Johnstown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 13, "span": [1523, 1540], "entity_id": "Q654947", "name": "Allegheny Plateau", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213", "level1": true}, {"id": 14, "span": [1570, 1579], "entity_id": "Q1070763", "name": "Johnstown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 15, "span": [1591, 1603], "entity_id": "Q7949281", "name": "WFGI-FM", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 16, "span": [1625, 1631], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "QUANTITY", "level1": null}, {"id": 17, "span": [1634, 1640], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "QUANTITY", "level1": null}]}

{"id": 1756151, "title": "Bakers Narrows", "text": "Bakers Narrows\n\nBakers Narrows, Manitoba, is a small residential community approximately 20 km southeast of Flin Flon on Lake Athapapuskow. There are five subdivisions located near the lakeshore with a total of approximately 150 cottages, many of which are permanent residences.\n\nThe community consists of both winterized homes and seasonal cottages. It straddles the North Arm and Little Athapap sections of Lake Athapapuskow and lies within Bakers Narrows Provincial Park. It is the location of the Flin Flon Airport and the Flin Flon/Bakers Narrows Water Aerodrome.\n\nThe remote community is surrounded by Precambrian boreal forest, a mixed forest of coniferous and deciduous trees of the Canadian Shield. There are stands of black spruce, jack pine, white spruce, and trembling aspen. The area is home to moose, black bear, lynx, wolf, and beaver. Bird species include raven, common loon, spruce grouse, bald eagle and hawk owl. There is some trapping and hunting, and recreational fishing is popular.\n\n The narrows have been inhabited since prehistoric times. Archaeological digs at Bakers Narrows Provincial Park revealed pottery, arrowheads, and other artifacts indicating regular habitation by the \"Shield Archaic Culture\", who hunted caribou in the area as far back as 7000 years ago. They were eventually supplanted by the Woodland Cree who were nomadic hunters in this region. The narrows were a seasonal camp for Cree families who would gather during the summer before heading to their individual hunting grounds in the autumn.\n\nThe first European to visit Bakers Narrows was Joseph Hansom. In the summer of 1773, as a young fur trader, he was sent inland by the Governor of Churchill to extend the reach of the Hudson's Bay Company. Hansom paddled from Lake Kississing down the Pineroot River, reaching Lake Athapapuskow and Bakers Narrows. Donaldson B. Dowling, working for the Geological Survey of Canada, was the first to survey the narrows in 1899.\n\nThe name comes from the first homesteader, Bill Baker a trapper and prospector from Ontario, who settled there with his wife Lydia Paul (from the Cumberland House Cree Nation) in approximately 1910 with the intention of establishing a trading post. In the early days, it was also called \"Bakers Landing\". To serve the growing mining industry in the Flin Flon area, a federal boat dock was built there in the early 1950s. The excellent fishing and camping near the dock led to the creation of the provincial park in 1961.\n\nThe Manitoba Highway 10 reached Bakers Narrows in 1951 and the airport was opened in 1968.\n\n54\u00b040\u203238\u2033N 101\u00b039\u203237\u2033W\n", "links": [[[32, 40], "Manitoba"], [[108, 117], "Flin Flon"], [[121, 138], "Lake Athapapuskow"], [[443, 473], "Bakers Narrows

{"id": 60185118, "title": "Let's Go (will.i.am song)", "text": "Let's Go (will.i.am song)\n\n\"Let's Go\" is a song by will.i.am that features Chris Brown, which was part of the former's fourth studio album \"#willpower\" before being removed in November 2013. The reason for the song's removal was due to the unlicensed sampling of \"Rebound\" by Arty and Mat Zo. It was replaced with \"Feelin' Myself\" on the re-release.\n\nThe song heavily samples \"Rebound\" by Arty and Mat Zo. Arty made the claim via Twitter in April 2013 that Interscope Records had not asked for permission from Anjunabeats before will.i.am sampled \"Rebound\". Chris Brown stated in a tweet that he didn't know of the track's original source and claimed that he performed it due to a feature request. A statement was released by Anjunabeats that even though credit was given to Arty in the sleeve notes, doing so is not an appropriate way to obtain permission of clearing a sample, which was done following on from Arty's Twitter claim. Anjunabeats issued this statement in response to when will.i.am was quoted as telling the Associated Press in self-defence:\n\nIn a later interview for KIIS-FM, will.i.am went on to admit that he accidentally stole \"Rebound\" with the sample and was confused whether or not he had the right to use it for \"Let's Go\". The situation was elaborated on by will.i.am: \"Arty is a dope producer so I wrote this song to 'Rebound' this last year. I got in touch with Arty and showed it to him, did a different version to it 'cause I asked him [to] make it newer 'cause I don't just wanna take your song and rap over it. But he said that after a year's time, \"we preferred writing over and using the [original] rebound. Something happened and the clearance... hopefully we resolved the issue\". The song was removed on the re-release of \"#willpower\" on November 26, 2013 and replaced as the fifth track on the album with \"Feelin' Myself\" after will.i.am contacted the owners of \"Rebound\" for negotiation. However, the audio was not deleted from will.i.am's Vevo account on YouTube.\n\nIn May 2013, Above & Beyond played \"Rebound\" at the Electric Daisy Carnival to make fun of will.i.am, and Mat Zo went on to do this too in June.\n", "links": [[[51, 60], "will.i.am"], [[75, 86], "Chris Brown"], [[140, 150], "willpower (will.i.am album)"], [[264, 271], "Rebound (Arty and Mat Zo song)"], [[276, 280],

Directors have included Martine Corn\u00e8de (2007-2014) and Beno\u00eet Van Reeth (2014\u2013present).\n\nThe archives has published inventories of some of its records, including those related to the colonial administration of Algeria, French Equatorial Africa, and French Indochina; the governmental Secr\u00e9tariat d'Etat \u00e0 la Marine and ; (prisons); private organizations such as the Comit\u00e9 central fran\u00e7ais pour l'Outre-Mer; and individuals such as , L\u00e9once Jore, and Ho Chi Minh.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "links": [[[72, 87], "Aix-en-Provence"], [[107, 126], "Archives Nationales (France)"], [[156, 178], "French colonial empire"], [[624, 662], "Universit\u00e9 de Provence Aix-Marseille I"], [[701, 709], "Ministry of Overseas France"], [[711, 720], "List of French possessions and colonies"], [[1209, 1233], "French Equatorial Africa"], [[1239, 1255], "French Indochina"], [[1274, 1304], "Minist\u00e8re de la Marine"], [[1356, 1396], "French Colonial Union"], [[1424, 1435], "L\u00e9once Jore"], [[1441, 1452], "Ho Chi Minh"]], "title_synonyms": [[37, 68], [414, 444], [484, 515]], "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54877110", "evaluation_span": [1079, 1457], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [1079, 1091], "entity_id": "Q2860545", "name": "Archives Nationales d'Outre-mer", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 1, "span": [1129, 1132], "entity_id": "Q2860545", "name": "Archives Nationales d'Outre-mer", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 2, "span": [1200, 1207], "entity_id": "Q262", "name": "Algeria", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 3, "span": [1209, 1233], "entity_id": "Q271894", "name": "French Equatorial Africa", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213", "level1": true}, {"id": 4, "span": [1239, 1255], "entity_id": "Q185682", "name": "French Indochina", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 5, "span": [1274, 1304], "entity_id": "Q16147194", "name": "Minist\u00e8re de la Marine", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 6, "span": [1356, 1396], "entity_id": "Q5501718", "name": "French Colonial Union", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q43229", "level1": true}, {"id": 7, "span": [1424, 1435], "entity_id": "Q15456810", "name": "L\u00e9once Jore", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q18336849", "level1": true}, {"id": 8, "span": [1441, 1452], "entity_id": "Q36014", "name": "Ho Chi Minhhhhj", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q18336849", "level1": true}]}
{"id": 4463417, "title": "Baranov Central Institute of Aviation Motor Development", "text": "Baranov Central Institute of Aviation Motor Development\n\nThe P. I. Baranov Central Institute of Aviation Motor Development (also known as the \"Central Institute for Aviation Motor Development named after P. I. Baranov\" or simply \"Central Institute of Aviation Motors\", CIAM or TsIAM, \"Tsentralniy Institut Aviatsionnogo Motorostroeniya\", ) is the only specialized Russian research and engineering facility dealing with advanced aerospace propulsion research, aircraft engine certification and other gas dynamics-related issues. It was founded in 1930.\n\nCIAM operates the largest aerospace engine testing facility in Europe, surpassed only by the United States's Arnold Engineering Development Center and Glenn Research Center. It is based in Lefortovo (the southeast okrug of Moscow) with an address of 2 Aviamotornaya street, Moscow, Postcode 111116. CIAM also operates a scientific testing center in Lytkarino, Moscow Oblast.\n\nThe bases of the institute were formed by such academics as Keldysh, Klimov and Chelomey. Since its foundation in 1930, CIAM designed nearly all Russian aviation motors and gas turbines. In 1933 CIAM was named after the late Soviet Vice-Narkom of Heavy Industry Petr Ionovich Baranov, who was one of the leading theorists of the Soviet aviation industry. Before World War II, all engine-design work was transferred to mass-production motor-building plants and their own design bureaus. CIAM focused on theoretical and experimental research and modernization of prototypes up to the production stage.\n\nAfter the war, CIAM was engaged with reactive (jet) engines for airplanes, successors to the first-generation turbojets. In the early 1950s, the largest test base in Europe was built in Lytkarino. In the 1970s, the institute began work on a ramjet engine using the special hypersonic \"flying laboratory\" GLL Holod. This experiment used a liquid hydrogen, actively cooled dual-mode ramjet, which was based on a hydrogen-fueled axisymmetrical engine placed on a Russian SA5 missile during the flight. The first successful test achieved Mach 5.6 in 1991, and the maximum speed achieved was Mach 5.7 in November 1992. A test with a goal of Mach 6.3 failed in March 1995.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the USSR, CIAM lost a large number of emigrating engineers. With the loss of government support and a lack of state aviation strategy, CIAM stayed afloat with contracts with China, French corporations, ABB and by offering logistical services. As of 2011, the situation has stabilized; CIAM leads some Russian programs, including development of the new perspective scramjet GLL Igla. It also researches gas pipelines; in March 2006, the institute signed an agreement with JSC Gasprom.\n\n\n55\u00b045\u203237\u2033N 37\u00b042\u203236\u2033E\n", "links": [[[475, 488], "Product

Listening back to that record, I like most of the songs, but the production is awful sounding.\"\n\nThe band recorded several songs for the album that were lost when producer James Murphy, then suffering from brain cancer and acting \"erratically\", was evicted from his studio in Oakland.\n\nAll songs written by Matt Harvey, except where noted.\nMetalStorm wrote: \"Gore Metal features a more melodic sound with catchy riffs and often involves three distinct vocalists, sort of like old Carcass.

{"id": 4200708, "title": "Athertonia", "text": "Athertonia\n\nAthertonia is a genus of tall trees, constituting part of the plant family Proteaceae. It is a monotypic taxon, and the sole described species is Athertonia diversifolia, commonly known as Atherton oak. It is a small to medium-sized tree and is endemic to restricted tablelands and mountainous regions of the wet tropics rain forests of north-eastern Queensland, Australia, where it is widespread. For example, it grows in the Atherton Tableland region with which it shares its name, from the colonial pastoralist John Atherton (1837\u20131913). Its closest relatives are \"Heliciopsis\" (South Asia) and \"Virotia\" (New Caledonia). A relative of the macadamia, it has potential as an ornamental tree and has an edible nut.\n\n\"Athertonia diversifolia\" was first described by Queensland Government Botanist C.T. White in 1918, who gave it the specific name derived from the Latin \"diversi-\" \"different\" and \"folium\" \"leaves\", from the fact that different-shaped leaves may be found on the one plant. He placed it in the genus \"Helicia\". The Dutch botanist Hermann Sleumer placed it in the genus \"Hicksbeachia\" in 1955, where it stayed until Johnson and Briggs placed it in its own genus although conceded it was related to the former genus. Thus, it is the only member of the monotypic genus \"Athertonia\". Common names include Atherton almond, Atherton Oak, White Oak, or cream silky oak.\n\n\"Athertonia diversifolia\" grows as a tree 8 to 30 m tall. The trunk may be buttressed and reaches a diameter of 30 cm. Juvenile leaves are a simple oblong shape with finely toothed margins but are replaced by large lobed intermediate leaves which reach 60 cm long. The adult leaves are variable in shape, lobed or entire, 12 \u2013 20 cm long and 5 \u2013 9 cm wide. Young branches and new growth are covered in fine rusty hair. Occurring from March to June, the flowers are cream and brown in colour and borne on 15 \u2013 34 cm long racemes. The lens-shaped fruit is 3.6 \u2013 4.1 cm long by 3.3 \u2013 3.8 cm wide and 1.9 \u2013 2.6 cm thick, dark blue, containing a woody-shelled nut with a large edible and crunchy kernel, which ripen in spring.\n\n\"Athertonia diversifolia\" is found in north Queensland from Cape Tribulation south to Mt Bartle Frere. Its habitat is rainforest, generally from 700 to 1150 m in altitude. but is found at 400 m at Alexandra Creek. Much of its former habitat has been cleared. The soils are deep volcanic loams.\n\nAtherton almond is cultivated to a limited extent for its edible nut, but makes a good specimen tree in large parks and has potential as an indoor foliage plant, or as a foliage plant in the cut flower industry. The species is readily propagated by seed.\n\n\"Athertonia diversifolia\" is the floral emblem of the Atherton shire in north Queensland. It is known as the Atherton oak due to the shape of its immature leaves which resemble those of the English oak \"Quercus robur\", to which it is unrelated.\n\n", "links": [[[28, 33], "genus"], [[87,
