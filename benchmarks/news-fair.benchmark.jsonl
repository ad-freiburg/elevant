We've been using condoms, but my boyfriend wants me to go on the Pill. I don't want to go back to it aged 48, when my chances of getting pregnant are almost non-existent. Wouldn't the rhythm method be sufficient?\n\nANSWER: Now here's an ironic thing: if you were trying to fall pregnant at the age of 48, the medics would tell you that your chances of doing so naturally were rather less than those of being hit by an asteroid.\n\nSuggest, however, that you're thinking of being laidback about contraception because you're far too old to conceive and the story changes dramatically. Everyone will cite a woman they know on the far side of her 40s who stopped bothering with protection and suddenly found herself knocked up.\n\nThey might also mention the fact that middle-aged women are the fastest-growing demographic seeking abortions, and that much of what's said about female fertility is wrong.\n\nSo, when I tell you to be cautious, I really mean it. If you're going to try the rhythm method, you need to be careful monitoring your temperature and ovulation.\n\nYou also need to be prepared to exercise extreme self-control during fertile periods - which is also when you'll be feeling most desire. Good luck with that.\n\nNone of this means that you have to go back on the Pill. There's a wide range of alternatives. The popular Mirena coil releases smaller doses of hormones than the contraceptive Pill and safeguards against pregnancy for five years.\n\nI would advise a trip to your nearest family planning clinic, where a specialist will talk you through all the best options.\n\nSend your questions to Rowan in confidence at lifeandstylereaders@dailymail.co.uk\n", "evaluation_span": [917, 1411], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [1100, 1101], "entity_id": "Q7371805", "name": "Rowan Pelling", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 1, "span": [1107, 1110], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 2, "span": [1127, 1128], "entity_id": "Q7371805", "name": "Rowan Pelling", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 3, "span": [1148, 1151], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 4, "span": [1187, 1190], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 5, "span": [1254, 1257], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 6, "span": [1360, 1363], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}]}

{"id": 2013269744, "title": "20130324 - Commentary: Who says public schools need more money?", "text": "Commentary: Who says public schools need more money?\n\nEditor's note: Ben Chavis is the co-author with Carey Blakely of \"Crazy Like A Fox: One Principal's Triumph in the Inner City.\" Chavis received his doctorate in education and philosophy from the University of Arizona and served as principal of American Indian Public Charter School for seven years. Chavis has also worked as a real estate investor. Currently, he is replicating the model he established at American Indian Public Charter School in various schools throughout the U.S. and Canada.\n\nEducator Ben Chavis says money isn't enough to improve schools run by incompetent administrators.\n\n(CNN) -- Teachers unions and politicians are constantly claiming that K-12 public schools need more money in order to produce good academic results. But does the data support the argument that our schools need more money to succeed?\n\nThe Oakland Unified School District had a budget of $602 million for the 2008-2009 school year, according to Katy Murphy, an education reporter with the Oakland Tribune. That budget, which includes $77 million spent on consultants, means that the district spends an average of $16,270 per student!\n\nWhat have we, the public taxpayers, received for our exceptionally generous financial support of the Oakland public schools? According to the California Department of Education, the district's reported 2008 California Standardized Test scores show:\n\n1. Of 707 eighth- and ninth-graders who took the California Standard test for general math: 1 percent tested advanced, 5 percent tested proficient and 94 percent failed by testing below grade level. See details about K-12 schools, teachers \"\n\n2. Of 2,506 ninth- and 10th-grade students who took the California Standards test in algebra: 0 percent tested advanced, 3 percent tested proficient and 97 percent failed the test.\n\nHow is it possible for a public school system to so liberally spend more than half a billion dollars and still fail to educate 94 percent or more students of all racial backgrounds? Does anyone believe providing more money to these public school systems will enhance these students' academic performance in mathematics?\n\nDuring my principalship at American Indian Public Charter School, we spent less than $8,000 per student, proving that schools did not need more money. We served a student population that is on average 98 percent minority, with 97 percent receiving free or reduced-price lunch and many who are non-English speakers and from single-parent families. AIPCS students spend three to four hours a day working on mathematics and English-language arts.\n\nIn 2009, they excelled in academics, physical fitness and any standardized test that they were given. The hard work of these students and staff has paid off with virtually all of our eighth-graders testing advanced in algebra, including 100 percent of our eighth-grade black students, Mexican-American students and American Indian students.\n\nBefore I became its principal, people called American Indian Public Charter School the zoo. The neighbors hated it. They couldn't stand the behavior of the students, who, with little supervision or control, wreaked havoc in the area.\n\nUnfortunately, the students who decided to attend the school did not receive the academics and structure they so direly needed. The school was in many ways a failure, a joke, a sham.\n\nWhen I took over as principal in 2000, it was the worst middle school in Oakland. I told the board I would take the job only if they let me go my own way and do what I thought was best. I implemented a golden rule at American Indian Public Charter School for staff, students and families: If you act like a winner, you'll be treated like a winner. If you act like a fool, you'll be treated like a fool. The charter school is now one of the top-scoring schools in the state and is nationally recognized.\n\nThe United States spends more money on public education than any other country in the world. Yet, we still have a secondary public education system that ranks with Third World countries in preparing our children in English-language arts, mathematics, science and social studies.\n\nWashington, D.C.; Detroit, Michigan; Los Angeles, California; Kansas City, Missouri; and numerous other cities throughout the United States are producing the same poor academic results at an extraordinary cost to the taxpayer and a tremendous academic loss to our students and country.\n\nI believe all the money in the world would not be enough to improve schools run by incompetent public school administrators. We need proven leaders who can prepare our children to be competitive members in a free-market society.\n\nThe American public has been conned into believing that public schools need more money. Have you ever met a public school administrator who said they have enough money?\n\nPresident Obama is moving in the \"right\" direction by reforming public schools to be held responsible to the American public in return for more money. It's very clear that most Americans want to ensure that accountability be attached to the stimulus money that is being awarded to all institutions, including public schools.\n\nNext time you hear school officials or politicians begging for more money, ask them how large the district's budget is and how many students are enrolled in their district. Then you do the math. After all, it's your money they want to take.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ben Chavis.\n\nAll About Education Issues \u2022 U.S. Department of Education \u2022 Charter Schools\n", "evaluation_span": [5181, 5574], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [5220, 5231], "entity_id": "Q82955", "name": "politician", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871"}, {"id": 1, "span": [5313, 5321], "entity_id": "Q48942", "name": "schoolchild", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871"}, {"id": 2, "span": [5370, 5374], "entity_id": "Q395", "name": "mathematics", "type": "Q11862829"}, {"id": 3, "span": [5454, 5464], "entity_id": "Q22826122", "name": "commentary", "type": "Q483394"}, {"id": 4, "span": [5485, 5495], "entity_id": "Q4885418", "name": "Ben Chavis", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 5, "span": [5527, 5555], "entity_id": "Q861556", "name": "United States Department of Education", "type": "Q43229"}]}

Kowalski, Ph.D., President and CEO of JDRF, on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorization of the Tandem Control-IQ algorithm for use as part of a hybrid closed-loop system\n\nNEW YORK, Dec. 13, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- \"Regulatory authorization of the Tandem Control-IQ algorithm for use as part of a hybrid closed-loop system is a huge win for the type 1 diabetes (T1D) community and a critical step forward in making day-to-day life better for people living with the disease.\n\nAs part of our mission to improve the lives of those affected by T1D, JDRF has been a leader in artificial pancreas (AP) research for more than 15 years and partnered with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to establish regulatory pathways to ensure AP technology gets into the hands of people with T1D as quickly as possible.\n\nThis is the second hybrid closed-loop system on the market and the first algorithm authorized as an interoperable automated glycemic controller, which means it could be a component of an open-protocol system. People with different devices could use the algorithm and manage their glucose levels in a way that works best for them. JDRF research grants supported the development of this algorithm, and our advocacy supported the Special Diabetes Program, which funded its clinical testing.\n\nUntil we find cures, we are continuing to support the development of new technologies and treatments to improve blood sugar management so people with T1D can live healthier and more manageable lives. JDRF is also fighting to ensure people with this disease have more choices and better access to the diabetes management tools that work best for them through our Coverage2Control campaign. Today's announcement is yet another reason why health plans should cover all FDA authorized diabetes management tools, to help people with T1D manage this life-threatening disease. In particular, JDRF calls upon UnitedHealthcare to lift its restrictions which limit options of insulin pumps available to its members.\"\n\n\nJDRF is the leading global organization funding type 1 diabetes (T1D) research. Our mission is to accelerate life-changing breakthroughs to cure, prevent and treat T1D and its complications. To accomplish this, JDRF has invested more than $2.2 billion in research funding since our inception. We are an organization built on a grassroots model of people connecting in their local communities, collaborating regionally for efficiency and broader fundraising impact and uniting on a national stage to pool resources, passion and energy. We collaborate with academic institutions, policymakers and corporate and industry partners to develop and deliver a pipeline of innovative therapies to people living with T1D. Our staff and volunteers throughout the United States and our six international affiliates are dedicated to advocacy, community engagement and our vision of a world without T1D.

{"id": 2009236249, "title": "20090814 - Respite for reptiles as demand drops for skins", "text": "Respite for reptiles as demand drops for skins\n\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) - As conspicuous consumption loses some of its cachet during the recession, the swamp's most conspicuous consumers have less to fear from humans.\n\nInstead of taking the half-million alligator eggs from marshes and swamps that they had in recent years, alligator farmers are expected to pull in 30,000 this year, with a final tally in December. And state wildlife officials expect the 2009 harvest of adult gators, which begins Aug. 26, to amount to a small fraction of last year's 35,500.\n\nNobody's buying, said Rapides Parish nuisance-alligator control officer Ron Guy. He's among more than 60 people around the state who get called if a gator wanders out of its bayou and into a local golf course or backyard. Their pay is the right to sell the skins.\n\nGators bought Louisiana farmers and hunters $71 million in 2007, modest revenue even at that peak. This year, revenue is expected to be closer to $10 million in 2009, a drop like locals say they've never seen.\n\n\"My father was in the fur and alligator business. I started buying fur and alligators when I was 13 years old,\" said Wayne Sagrera, 65, who has about 75,000 alligators at Vermilion Gator Farm Inc. in Abbeville. \"I've seen some slowdowns. But nothing to compare to this.\"\n\nPeople who are still buying expensive accessories have shifted away from conspicuous consumption - for instance, Jimmy Choo is selling obvious faux-crocodile as well as the real thing, fashion consultant Robert Burke said.\n\n\"There's certainly a sensitivity in the luxury market of anything that is too much luxury, and alligator would fit into that category,\" Burke said.\n\nHis income from hauling off nuisance alligators let Guy leave construction work six years ago, but he's back now - and running out far less often for alligators.\n\n\"Instead of going on every call as soon as it comes in, you prioritize them,\" Guy said. \"If it's under a car in the Sonic parking lot, you've got to go.\"\n\nDemand for crocodilian leather, including the large alligator and crocodile skins used for handbags and the caiman leather used for cowboy boots, dropped more than 40 percent worldwide between the first quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009, according to Choon Heong Koh, executive director of Singapore tannery Heng Long International Ltd.\n\nDemand for small, farmed hides used for watchbands fell even more dramatically - 80 percent or more, he said in an e-mail to The Associated Press.\n\nLuxury watches are \"such a high-end item - when those people stop spending money you get real nervous,\" said Dave Travers, owner of Sebring Custom Tanning in Sebring, Fla.\n\nEven John Price - whose Insta-Gator Ranch and Hatchery in Covington gets 40 percent of its income from tours, including egg-hatching tours that start in mid-August each year - has suffered. He usually raises about 1,500 alligators a year to sell their hides. Instead of collecting 1,500 eggs this year from the wild, he collected 200, largely because people want to hold eggs while they hatch.\n\n\"We have customers who have booked the right to hatch an alligator. I don't want to call them back and say, 'Sorry, we're not doing it,'\" Price said.\n\nAbout 30 of those 200 'gators will wind up back in the wild.

{"id": 2011294773, "title": "20111109 - Review of Glee, \"The First Time\"", "text": "Review of Glee, \"The First Time\"\n\n\nLast American virgins: Rachel and Blaine contemplate some, er, character research in \"The First Time.\"\n\nSpoilers for last night's Glee below:\n\nRight up front, let me say that \"The First Time\" was the best episode, overall, of Glee season three. Before we get to the good stuff, though, we had to get through about fifteen minutes of complete contrivance. So let me gripe about those first, because I'm kind of a jerk that way.\n\n\"The First Time\" is about sex and virginity, hence the name. And lest we miss that theme, it begins by morphing Artie into an overconfident, pushy director who questions Rachel and Blaine's ability to play Maria and Tony without having become Jets all the way, as it were. (Later, he decides to counsel Coach Beiste, diagnosing her problem with intimacy. Artie, it seems, is now Dr. Drew Pinsky.)\n\nThe scene screams of a forced conflict designed to drive the plot: it's as if Artie has become Will, assigning Rachel and Blaine the loss of their virginity by writing SEX on a whiteboard as their weekly project. I don't buy it: I don't buy [1] that Artie would become fixed on this idea (despite the intro about his trying to fake his way through directing by having strong opinions) [2] that Rachel and Blaine would take it to heart (\"How are we, as virgins, supposed to follow that?\") and [3] two faculty members, however uncomfortable with the topic for their own reasons, would step back while a school musical director urged his stars to have sex for the good of the performance.\n\nThe thing is, you don't need a contrived reason to make an episode of Glee about sex and sexual pressure. Here's a perfectly good reason: the show takes place in a high school. Sex as a topic is kind of a given. And once we got past that setup - and that unfortunate Warblers Billy Joel video - this was a really fine episode with some genuine, believable character moments.\n\nLots of them too, and yet probably the best thing I can say for \"First Time\" is that it serviced a good half-dozen storylines but did not feel at all crowded. (Though her story got third billing, Dot Jones continued stunning work as Coach Beiste, one of Glee's few characters who can be over-the-top funny and moving at the same time, rather than in alternation.) Kurt and Rachel's respective virginity stories, for instance, were rooted in very real, existing relationship dynamics that needed no dues-ex-Artie to prod them.\n\nIn Kurt's case, it was about his wanting to assert his identity as an out gay teen, but also his autonomy to be the kind of gay teen he wants to be: in his case, a sweet, even corny romantic-which itself is a rebellion against highly sexualized teen culture in general (manifest in many things, Glee among them) and against a specific sexualized subculture within the gay community (here represented by seeming Gossip-Girl outtake Sebastian, and the saddest gay bar in Ohio).\n\nThis, not any \"Will they do it?\" debate, was was made his storyline for me: in its own way, his fight with Blaine in the parking lot was as much a statement as his coming out itself. It's his way of asserting that to him, being gay is not simply defined by sex, it's defined by love. And his tete-a-tete with newly-minted bear Karofsky, a nice epilogue to that storyline from last season, built on that: it underscored the point that being gay does not in itself settle your identity, it's simply one more step in figuring out what your identity is ultimately going to be, where you fit in.\n\nRachel and Finn's will-they-won't-they, meanwhile, hung on Rachel's insecurity as a performer - it is a Rachel story, after all - but also on their often-unspoken realization that there are forces that may push them apart after graduation. This got brought to a head for Finn in his disappointment with the Ohio State recruiter; hearing that he's reached his \"ceiling\" was a harsh and very real moment, and Cory Monteith really sold Finn's feeling of being helpless and overmatched, unable to keep up with Rachel as she moves on to bigger things. I'm not sure how romantic it is to see them end up in bed essentially as pity sex (I half-expected Rachel to say, \"Now I'm doing this for the right reason: Because I feel sorry for you\"). But it rooted the decision in their larger story: it's one way they can be together that's still in their control.\n\nOh, yeah: I guess I should say something about the whole plot-about-teens-having-sex business. Um, it's high school? I know some people hold stories set in school to a different standard, but I have a hard time with the idea that a TV show should (or can) try to influence teenagers\" sexual behavior-much less influence it toward never, ever having sex until marriage (or at least graduation).\n\nThe episode said a lot of things about sex, negative and positive, but the bottom line was that it made out first-time sex to be a big deal. That seems about right.\n\nNow a quick hail of bullets:\n\n* I hadn't thought there was much Glee could do to switch up its musical format, but I very much liked the device of using rehearsal performances of West Side songs to comment on the action. I don't know that the series can repeat the device once the musical is over, but I do hope it continues to mix things up.\n\n* Likewise, while there was a certain TV level of production in the musical itself, it was a good move to make the effort to have it sound like an actual high school production in an auditorium, rather than a highly-produced iTunes download.\n\n* \"Poison Arrow\" is easily my favorite ABC song - from back when I was a young person, before the Great War - so it was a little sad to see it now used as an auditory shorthand for \"seedy Ohio nightclub.\" But I cannot say it was entirely inappropriate.\n\n* I'm not sure if the musical scenes are meant to convey the sense that Santana is currently blowing everyone else in New Directions away, but that's how it looks to me.\n\n* Will and Sue? Did not miss them one bit.\n", "evaluation_span": [3520, 4930], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [3520, 3526], "entity_id": "Q1990104", "name": "Rachel Berry", "type": "Q17537576|Q215627"}, {"id": 1, "span": [3531, 3535], "entity_id": "Q2163539", "name": "Finn Christopher Hudson", "type": "Q17537576|Q215627"}, {"id": 2, "span": [3579, 3585], "entity_id": "Q1990104", "name": "Rachel Berry", "type": "Q17537576|Q215627"}, {"id": 3, "span": [3588, 3598], "entity_id": "Q3152967", "name": "emotional insecurity", "type": "Q169872"}, {"id": 4, "span": [3604, 3613], "entity_id": "Q713200", "name": "performing artist", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871"}, {"id": 5, "span": [3624, 3630], "entity_id": "Q1990104", "name": "Rachel Berry", "type": "Q17537576|Q215627"}, {"id": 6, "span": [3791, 3795], "entity_id": "Q2163539", "name": "Finn Christopher Hudson", "type": "Q17537576|Q215627"}, {"id": 7, "span": [3799, 3802], "entity_id": "Q2163539", "name": "Finn Christopher Hudson", "type": "Q17537576|Q215627"}, {"id": 8, "span": [3827, 3837], "entity_id": "Q7080909", "name": "Ohio State Buckeyes football", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 9, "span": [3838, 3847], "entity_id": "Q2072298", "name": "recruiter", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871"}, {"id": 10, "span": [3862, 3864], "entity_id": "Q2163539", "name": "Finn Christopher Hudson", "type": "Q17537576|Q215627"}, {"id": 11, "span": [3875, 3878], "entity_id": "Q2163539", "name": "Finn Christopher Hudson", "type": "Q17537576|Q215627"}, {"id": 12, "span": [3927, 3940], "entity_id": "Q296484", "name": "Cory Monteith", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 13, "span": [3953, 3957], "entity_id": "Q2163539", "name": "Finn Christopher Hudson", "type": "Q17537576|Q215627"}, {"id": 14, "span": [4026, 4032], "entity_id": "Q1990104", "name": "Rachel Berry", "type": "Q17537576|Q215627"}, {"id": 15, "span": [4036, 4039], "entity_id": "Q1990104", "name": "Rachel Berry", "type": "Q17537576|Q215627"}, {"id": 16, "span": [4067, 4068], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 17, "span": [4150, 4151], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 18, "span": [4166, 4172], "entity_id": "Q1990104", "name": "Rachel Berry", "type": "Q17537576|Q215627"}, {"id": 19, "span": [4186, 4187], "entity_id": "Q1990104", "name": "Rachel Berry", "type": "Q17537576|Q215627"}, {"id": 20, "span": [4231, 4232], "entity_id": "Q1990104", "name": "Rachel Berry", "type": "Q17537576|Q215627"}, {"id": 21, "span": [4248, 4251], "entity_id": "Q2163539", "name": "Finn Christopher Hudson", "type": "Q17537576|Q215627"}, {"id": 22, "span": [4381, 4382], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 23, "span": [4389, 4390], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 24, "span": [4488, 4489], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 25, "span": [4563, 4564], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 26, "span": [4766, 4777], "entity_id": "Q520766", "name": "The First Time", "type": "Q17537576|Q2424752"}]}

{"id": 20181523890, "title": "20180220 - Feminists want Mila Kunis to turn down a Harvard award", "text": "Feminists want Mila Kunis to turn down a Harvard award\n\nA Harvard University theater group with an all-male cast is under fire from those who say it should allow women onstage - and they're asking Mila Kunis to take up their cause.\n\nDetractors are calling on the Hasty Pudding troupe to start casting women and to update sexist portrayals of women. Amid the debate, some are calling on Kunis to reconsider her acceptance of the group's Woman of the Year award on Thursday to protest the exclusion.\n\n'It would be a wonderful thing for her to not accept this award, to say this is gender inequality,' said Liz Kantor, a senior studying molecular and cellular biology, who auditioned for this year's show.\n\n'There are women on campus who are more than willing to take advantage of these opportunities, yet they're still being excluded.'\n\nTickets to the Man of the Year roast honoring Paul Rudd cost $200 - but the price for the Woman of the Year event are just $80.\n\nHasty Pudding is known for bawdy comedic revues that feature men in drag playing female characters, a longstanding tradition in the group, which says it was formed in 1795.\n\nBut more recently, women have sought acting roles in the student-written parodies, which are shown in Massachusetts, New York and Bermuda and have helped launch careers for former students ranging from Jack Lemmon to Broadway composer Larry O'Keefe.\n\nKantor is among about 20 women who auditioned for this year's show as a form of protest, an idea started by two women in 2015. Each year, the women have promptly been cut.\n\nWomen can instead take behind-the-scenes jobs, including writing the shows or working on the technical crew, the group says on its website.\n\nStudents on Hasty Pudding's executive board, which is led by a woman and includes several female members, declined to comment. Overall, about half the 50 students involved with the group are women.\n\nThe troupe has been criticized for its all-male cast before, including in a 2016 petition from dozens of former members.\n\nIts shows take cues from the Shakespearean era, when men played all roles. Harvard itself admitted only male undergraduates until a partial merger with Radcliffe College in 1977.\n\nThe Man and Woman of the Year awards precede the kickoff of the annual revue, which includes more than 30 performances in February and March.\n\nKunis, whose credits include 'That '70s Show' and 'Black Swan,' has spoken out sharply against sexism in entertainment, including in a 2016 essay. She did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSome students and alumni have also said this year's Man of the Year, Paul Rudd, should stand up against the exclusion. A message seeking comment was sent to a representative for the actor.\n\nOthers recently named Woman of the Year by the group include Octavia Spencer and Amy Poehler, who cracked a biting joke about the group's exclusion of women when she accepted the honor in 2015.\n\n'You know it's time for a change when the Augusta National Golf Club has lapped you in terms of being progressive,' Poehler said, referring to the Georgia club's 2012 decision to admit women.\n\nSome critics are also challenging the portrayal of women in the revues, which have featured characters with names like 'Donna My Knees' and 'Sheila Rowsya.'\n\n'It just magnifies the misogyny that men are portraying these characters,' said Kantor, of West Nyack, New York. 'They're usually just the most blatant stereotypes you could think of.'\n\nWomen who have pushed for a place in the cast say students are split. Some say women in drag wouldn't be as funny, and some say the all-male cast is a tradition that should be protected.\n\nHasty Pudding started as a social club, taking its name from the porridge members brought to meetings.

On top of this, there's a 1.3 per cent credit card charge.\n\nConsider if you donated \u00a310 by credit card. The amount is topped up to \u00a312.50 because of gift aid. The 5 per cent fee is applied - 63p - then 1.3 per cent credit card charge on the \u00a310 - 13p - taking the total to 76p.\n\nThis means fees account for 7.6 per cent of the original \u00a310 donation\n\nSome of the people I've spoken to this week, on social media and in person, don't realise there is a fee at all.\n\nIt's hardly surprising. There's no mention of it on the homepage and only a small reference way down at the foot of each giving page, which most donors are unlikely to see.\n\nJustGiving pioneered this method of online giving a decade ago but now it's the supine encumbent, surpassed by far cheaper rivals, such as Virginmoneygiving.com, Bmycharity.com and Charitygiving.co.uk.\n\nVirgin Money, which is not-for-profit, only charges 2 per cent on donations and not on gift aid, and Bmycharity.com applies no commission, just a flat charge on card payments.\n\nThey also charge the charities a lower fee than JustGiving just to register to accept donations. [Read the story on Justgiving and its cheaper rivals].\n\nIt's big business for JustGiving. Consider that the London Marathon raises more than \u00a350million a year. JustGiving will account for a large chunk of that each year - and take 5 per cent.\n\nJustGiving claims its revenues help to hone the process of giving and help it make more money for charities. It claims to have raised \u00a3770million since 2000, which should mean earnings of \u00a338.5million for the company. It insists \u00a314million has been 're-invested in technology alone'.\n\nPresumably after the staff are paid - there's 72 of them - there's potential for decent profits.\n\nTo be fair, innovation should be encouraged and rewarded when it contributes to the common good.\n\nBut for the sake of transparency the company should declare its cut of each donation during the actual payment process and publish its annual profits on the website. And just maybe it should take a little less.\n", "evaluation_span": [2070, 2639], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [2092, 2102], "entity_id": "Q6316819", "name": "Justgiving", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 1, "span": [2122, 2137], "entity_id": "Q578794", "name": "London Marathon", "type": "Q1656682|Q349"}, {"id": 2, "span": [2156, 2165], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY"}, {"id": 3, "span": [2174, 2184], "entity_id": "Q6316819", "name": "Justgiving", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 4, "span": [2245, 2246], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY"}, {"id": 5, "span": [2258, 2268], "entity_id": "Q6316819", "name": "Justgiving", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 6, "span": [2276, 2279], "entity_id": "Q6316819", "name": "Justgiving", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 7, "span": [2333, 2335], "entity_id": "Q6316819", "name": "Justgiving", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 8, "span": [2367, 2369], "entity_id": "Q6316819", "name": "Justgiving", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 9, "span": [2393, 2403], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY"}, {"id": 10, "span": [2410, 2414], "entity_id": "DATETIME", "name": "Unknown", "type": "DATETIME"}, {"id": 11, "span": [2447, 2458], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY"}, {"id": 12, "span": [2463, 2474], "entity_id": "Q6316819", "name": "Justgiving", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 13, "span": [2476, 2478], "entity_id": "Q6316819", "name": "Justgiving", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 14, "span": [2488, 2497], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY"}, {"id": 15, "span": [2589, 2591], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY"}]}

He don't try at all though. Younger than my exes but he act like such a man so I see nothing better, I keep him forever.'\n\nFans immediately assumed Taylor was singing about actor boyfriend Joe, 26, who is younger than previous loves Tom, 36, and Calvin, 33, and made his movie debut as a solider in the 2016 film Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk.\n\nThe superstar then seems to allude to her past doomed romances with Tom, Calvin and the likes of Harry Styles, 23 and Jake Gyllenhaal, 26, by purring: 'Every love I've known in comparison is a failure, I forget their names now. I'm so very tame now. Never be the same now.'\n\nMeanwhile, others have asked if Taylor is poking fun at her serial dater reputation with the lyrics: 'Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me, stealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry.'\n\nTo an ebullient tune, the chorus blares that 'In the middle of the night, in my dreams, you should see the things we do, baby. In the middle of the night, in my dreams, I know I'm gonna be with you.'\n\nTaylor has been quietly dating Joe since last year, choosing to keep their romance away from the limelight, which means if Ready For It? was penned about Joe, it's the first time she's publicly acknowledged the relationship.\n\nSome fans have wondered whether the song title, Ready For It?, is directed at Joe, asking if he's ready for the attention that comes with dating the pop princess.\n\nThe song was released amid claims Taylor has filed paperwork to trademark phrases and lyrics connected with her new reputation album, including the line from Look What You Made Me Do, 'The old Taylor can't come to the phone right now. Why? Because she's dead.'\n\nAccording to TMZ, the award-winning singer-songwriter has also trademarked song titles from her reputation album so she can use the lyrics and titles on official merchandise.\n\nMeanwhile, a minute-long snippet of Ready For It? debuted during the Alabama versus Florida State football game on Saturday, before Taylor released the entire track to YouTube on Sunday.\n\nIn stark contrast to Look What You Made Me Do, the peppy new anthem struck a far more upbeat note, with Taylor singing of love and romance.\n\nBoth Taylor and ESPN shared a clip of the track with fans on social media, which was the background music for scenes of the two football teams prepared to hit the field.\n\nThe video featured scenes of cheerleaders, fans, football players, and seemed to herald a major shift from Look What You Made Me Do.\n\n'Are you ready for it?' Taylor sings in the pop country song. 'Baby let the games begin.'\n\nTwitter was ablaze with fan reaction, including YouTube personality Raphael Gomes, who wrote: 'oh my good i am shooketh, #readyforit sounds like red meets 1989 meets look what you made me do, it sounds magical'.\n\nAnother fan wrote a tweet in which his response to the song snippet was a GIF of Jim Parsons' The Big Bang Theory character Sheldon hyperventilating into a paper bag.\n\nAs some eagle-eyed fans noticed, Taylor had hinted at this single on August 24, in an Instagram post promoting Look What You Made Me Do.\n\nShe'd written: '...ready for it? New single #LookWhatYouMadeMeDo out now. Pre-order #reputation (link in bio) and find out about tickets and merch at taylorswift.com'.\n\nThe whole song will be the opener on reputation, according toPeople.\n\nDespite the fact Look What You Made Me Do proclaimed the 'old Taylor' was 'dead,' Ready For It? appears to be a return to form - a country-tinged, peppy love song.\n\nLook What You Made Me Do, on the other hand, had been a score-settling number aimed at those 'I don't like.'\n\nShe lashed out at betrayals: 'You asked me for a place to sleep, / Locked me out, and threw a feast,' and appeared to dredge up her on-off feud with Kanye West in the line: 'I don't like your tilted stage,' Kanye having performed on tilted stages on tour.\n\nThe lyrics insisted that 'I got smarter. I got harder in the nick of time,' and that 'Honey, I rose up from the dead. I do it all the time.'\n\nShe warned: 'I've got a list of names, and yours is in red underlined.'\n\nWhen that song's music video debuted at Sunday's MTV Video Music Awards, fans were treated to a smorgasbord of references to her old beefs.\n\nAt one point, she looks strikingly like Katy Perry while crashing a car and emerging from the wreck brandishing a Grammy Award.\n\nKaty's infamously a 13-time Grammy nominee and a zero-time winner, whilst Taylor's won a grand total of 10 Grammy Awards herself.\n\nIn the most scathing dig of the video, she lounges in a bathtub full of jewelry, possibly in reference to Kim Kardashian's robbery last October in Paris.\n\nThe robbers had bound her at gunpoint and flung her into the bathtub of her suite at the H\u00f4tel de Pourtal\u00e8s, making off with millions of dollars worth of her jewelry.\n\nAt one point, whilst sitting in the bathtub in the music video, Taylor even mimes firing off a gun.\n\nKim had involved herself in Taylor's feud with Kanye last year, after which Taylor accused the couple of 'character assassination,' so it's interesting that the bathtub bit of the music video sees Taylor gripe about 'How you laugh when you lie.'\n\nOld flames get a going over too, including Tom Hiddleston, who was notoriously photographed during their relationship in a tank top reading: 'I [heart] T.S.'\n\nTaylor appears in the video with male backup dancers wearing stilettos, hose and crop tops that have got that same inscription.\n\nBy the end of the video, there's a row of Taylors - each dressed to represent a different one of her past personae - and they all begin sniping at one another.\n\nOne, for example, is the gawky Taylor of the You Belong With Me video, and another's wearing the gown she wore to the 2009 VMAs, at which Kanye had interrupted her acceptance speech to shower praise on Beyonce.\n\nThe dorky, perpetually thrilled You Belong With Me Taylor is hectored by one of the others: 'You can't possibly be that surprised all the time.'\n\nWhen VMA Taylor expresses a desire 'to be excluded from this narrative' - a phrase she'd used last summer vis-\u00e0-vis the Kimye feud - all the others scream: 'SHUT UP!'\n", "evaluation_span": [2617, 3120], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [2630, 2633], "entity_id": "Q2630118", "name": "TMZ", "type": "Q2424752"}, {"id": 1, "span": [2635, 2670], "entity_id": "Q26876", "name": "Taylor Swift", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 2, "span": [2709, 2712], "entity_id": "Q26876", "name": "Taylor Swift", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 3, "span": [2713, 2729], "entity_id": "Q37814092", "name": "Reputation", "type": "Q2424752", "children": [4]}, {"id": 4, "span": [2713, 2723], "entity_id": "Q37814092", "name": "Reputation", "type": "Q2424752", "parent": 3}, {"id": 5, "span": [2733, 2736], "entity_id": "Q26876", "name": "Taylor Swift", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 6, "span": [2829, 2842], "entity_id": "Q38552445", "name": "...Ready for It?", "type": "Q2424752"}, {"id": 7, "span": [2862, 2869], "entity_id": "Q4705216", "name": "Alabama Crimson Tide football", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 8, "span": [2877, 2890], "entity_id": "Q5461626", "name": "Florida State Seminoles football", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 9, "span": [2891, 2899], "entity_id": "Q41323", "name": "American football", "type": "Q349"}, {"id": 10, "span": [2908, 2916], "entity_id": "DATETIME", "name": "Unknown", "type": "DATETIME"}, {"id": 11, "span": [2925, 2931], "entity_id": "Q26876", "name": "Taylor Swift", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 12, "span": [2941, 2957], "entity_id": "Q38552445", "name": "...Ready for It?", "type": "Q2424752"}, {"id": 13, "span": [2961, 2968], "entity_id": "Q866", "name": "YouTube", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 14, "span": [2972, 2978], "entity_id": "DATETIME", "name": "Unknown", "type": "DATETIME"}, {"id": 15, "span": [3002, 3026], "entity_id": "Q37912621", "name": "Look What You Made Me Do", "type": "Q2424752"}, {"id": 16, "span": [3028, 3048], "entity_id": "Q38552445", "name": "...Ready for It?", "type": "Q2424752"}, {"id": 17, "span": [3085, 3091], "entity_id": "Q26876", "name": "Taylor Swift", "type": "Q215627"}]}

Kasem began that show in 1970 and hosted it and variations of it until finally ending his radio career in 2009.\n\nBut for more than just those encouraging words, Kasem will be remembered for helping to elevate the radio disc jockey gig to one of storyteller and observer of the human condition.\n\nFans would write in to his show for \"long-distance dedications\" -- requesting a song for a loved one, a friend or a personal connection far away. In his smooth baritone voice, Kasem would begin \"Dear Casey\" and proceed to tell tales that ranged from heartbreaking to inspirational.\n\nThe dedications poured in from around the world. In 1986, Kasem read a dedication request from a woman in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, who wanted to honor her sister who -- despite suffering paralysis -- was studying for her master's degree in the United States.\n\n\"I'm so proud of her, not only for her achievements, but proud of her will and toughness and of her stubborn determination to pick up the pieces and start all over again when most of us would break down and quit,\" Kasem read. \"Casey, could you kindly play 'Broken Wings' for my sister Ayesha at Oklahoma State University? I do hope she's listening, for this is a message from those who love her, all the way from home here in Malaysia.\"\n\nKasem got personal after the death of Beatle John Lennon. The DJ offered up moving words in 1980 after Lennon was gunned down near his New York City apartment by Mark David Chapman.\n\n\"But John died having discovered who he was,\" Kasem said. \"John Lennon, husband to Yoko, father to Sean [Lennon's young son with wife Yoko Ono].\"\n\nThe role of music orator was one Kasem took very seriously.\n\n\"It's so simple: what do people love?\" Kasem said to the New York Times in a 1999 article. \"Plato said it best. 'People who tell the stories rule society.' And we tell the stories, and people love to hear the stories. Of course, we've got tremendous responsibility to become accurate with those stories. And in most cases to be wholesome.\"\n\nOn Sunday, the \"AT40\" website posted a tribute to Kasem.

In Cameron's case, losing another vote on Syria could trigger a leadership challenge against him, something that a significant minority in his fractious party would welcome.\n\nMany politicians and commentators have also expressed fears that Cameron's defeat could damage Britain's 'special relationship' with the United States given that President Barack Obama had asked for and not got British military support.\n\nHowever, another poll showed most Britons did not share that fear. The survey, by the BBC, showed that 72 percent of those asked did not think UK-U.S. ties would be harmed, and two thirds of respondents would not care if they were.\n\n(Reporting By Andrew Osborn; Editing by Andrew Heavens)\n", "evaluation_span": [84, 755], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [85, 91], "entity_id": "Q84", "name": "London", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 1, "span": [93, 100], "entity_id": "Q130879", "name": "Reuters", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 2, "span": [104, 126], "entity_id": "Q14211", "name": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom", "type": "Q4164871"}, {"id": 3, "span": [127, 140], "entity_id": "Q192", "name": "David Cameron", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 4, "span": [208, 213], "entity_id": "Q858", "name": "Syria", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 5, "span": [223, 226], "entity_id": "Q192", "name": "David Cameron", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 6, "span": [256, 262], "entity_id": "DATETIME", "name": "Unknown", "type": "DATETIME"}, {"id": 7, "span": [274, 281], "entity_id": "Q842438", "name": "British people", "type": "Q33829"}, {"id": 8, "span": [291, 294], "entity_id": "Q192", "name": "David Cameron", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 9, "span": [322, 325], "entity_id": "Q192", "name": "David Cameron", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 10, "span": [344, 350], "entity_id": "Q5150446", "name": "ComRes", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 11, "span": [351, 354], "entity_id": "Q220072", "name": "ITV", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 12, "span": [372, 374], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY"}, {"id": 13, "span": [406, 408], "entity_id": "Q192", "name": "David Cameron", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 14, "span": [444, 452], "entity_id": "DATETIME", "name": "Unknown", "type": "DATETIME"}, {"id": 15, "span": [503, 505], "entity_id": "Q192", "name": "David Cameron", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 16, "span": [510, 519], "entity_id": "Q4175034", "name": "legislator", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871"}, {"id": 17, "span": [566, 578], "entity_id": "Q9630", "name": "Labour Party", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 18, "span": [593, 596], "entity_id": "Q9630", "name": "Labour Party", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 19, "span": [607, 614], "entity_id": "Q192", "name": "David Cameron", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 20, "span": [624, 637], "entity_id": "Q9626", "name": "Conservative Party", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 21, "span": [641, 643], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY"}, {"id": 22, "span": [649, 653], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY"}, {"id": 23, "span": [717, 720], "entity_id": "Q192", "name": "David Cameron", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 24, "span": [750, 754], "entity_id": "DATETIME", "name": "Unknown", "type": "DATETIME"}]}

It inflames people.\n\nAnd no politician in the history of Planet Earth inflames people quite as much as Donald J. Trump.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nOn Friday, a video was posted on Twitter by Ansel Herz, deputy communications director for Democrat Rep. Pramila Jayapal.\n\nIt showed Trump appearing to avoid shaking hands with a disabled child before leaving a White House function.\n\n\"Child in wheelchair reaches up twice to shake the president's hand,\" was Herz's simple but devastating caption.\n\n\"If you're disgusted by this,\" he added, \"follow my boss: @RepJayapal. People call her \"the anti-Trump.\" \"\n\nDisgust duly followed.\n\nThe short video clip went viral within minutes, sparking horror and rage around the world.\n\nShare this article\n\nShare\n\n4.4k shares\n\nKeith Olbermann, infamous left-wing political commentator who now hosts a Trump-bashing GQ webshow \"The Resistance,\" led the charge, re-tweeting Herz's video clip with the words: \"About Trump, this is mortifying, revelatory. OTOH, I'm somebody who shook his damnable hand. The child is fortunate he didn't touch the evil.\"\n\nFor JK Rowling, this was the moment she had long been waiting for.\n\nHere, right before our very eyes, was actual visible proof that Trump really is a barbaric, callous monster as she keeps saying.\n\nShe hit her laptop faster than Usain Bolt hits his stride.\n\nFirst, Rowling retweeted Herz's tweet alongside a quote she had located from legendary civil rights activist Maya Angelou that read: \"When someone shows you who they are, believe them.\"\n\nIn other words, THIS was the real Donald Trump: a merciless man who would deliberately ignore a young disabled child reaching up to shake his hand.\n\nSeconds later, she tweeted again: \"Trump imitated a disabled reporter. Now he pretends not to see a child in a wheelchair, as though frightened he may catch his condition.\"\n\nWow.\n\nNo room for ambiguity there.\n\nRowling was very clear: Trump knew the disabled child was there and snubbed him because he was worried about being infected with whatever disease the boy may have.\n\nTweets No3 and No4 came together, fast and furious: \"This monster of narcissism values only himself and his pale reflections. The disabled, minorities, transgender people, the poor, women... (unless related to him by ties of blood, and therefore his creations) are treated with contempt, because they do not resemble Trump.\"\n\nThen, in tweet No5, Rowling got personal, invoking the spirit of her mother who died in 1990.\n\n\"My mother used a wheelchair. I witnessed people uncomfortable around her disability, but if they had a shred of decency they got over it.\"\n\nTweet No6 explained this was why Rowling felt SO enraged: \"So, yes, that clip of Trump looking deliberately over a disabled child's head, ignoring his outstretched hand, has touched me on the raw.\"\n\nAgain, she left no room for any doubt. Trump hadn't accidentally snubbed the boy, he had done it \"deliberately.\"\n\nTweet No7 clarified why this was so vile: \"That man occupies the most powerful office in the free world and his daily outrages against civilised norms are having a corrosive effect.\"\n\nAnd then, in Tweet No8, JK Rowling reached peak anger: \"How stunning,\" she wrote, \"and how horrible, that Trump cannot bring himself to shake the hand of a small boy who only wanted to touch the President.\"\n\nBy this stage, it would be hard not to share Rowling's uncontrollable rage - right? I suspect most of her 11.4 million Twitter followers would certainly have felt that way.\n\nThey trust Rowling.\n\nAs she never ceases to remind us from her high moral plinth, she is the very beacon of honesty, decency and fairness in a world increasingly blighted by Trump-related lies, indecency and unfairness.\n\nShe, like Rep. Jayapal, is the \"anti-Trump.\"\n\nShe is someone who would never snub a disabled boy.\n\nThere's just one problem: it was all a lie.\n\nTrump didn't snub the boy. In fact he did the complete opposite.\n\nThe full video of this incident emerged several hours after Rowling tweeted.\n\nIt shows Trump heading directly to the boy the moment he entered the room.\n\nHe greets him before he greets anyone else.\n\nThen the President crouches down, touches the boy and talks just to him for a few more seconds before moving on.\n\nIt turns out that Trump spent more time with the boy in the wheelchair than any other guest - displaying all the compassion and empathy he had been accused of failing to display.\n\nBy the time this longer video appeared, the original edited clip was everywhere, gleefully fuelled by high profile liberals.\n\nChelsea Clinton, who has 1.8 million followers, seized on Rowling's tweets, re-tweeting both the Maya Angelou quote and clip, and the one about how \"stunning and horrible\" it was that Trump snubbed the boy.\n\nAs Sir Winston Churchill once said: \"A lie gets halfway round the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on.\"\n\nAnsel Herz, once he saw the full video, immediately removed his tweets.\n\n\"Deleted because it turned out to missing some context,\" he said. \"Apologies.\"\n\nMissing some context? You can say that again, buddy.\n\nLet's be very clear: you made the whole world think Trump hates disabled kids.\n\nNow, at this point, some five hours after her vicious tweet-storm, JK Rowling started to be bombarded with demands to delete her own tweets and apologise. I tweeted her myself to say: \"What's stunning and horrible is how you lied to viciously smear Trump. Delete these lies.\"\n\nShe didn't respond, to anybody.\n\nThe world's most aggressively self-righteous tweeter went unusually silent.\n\nA whole day went by.\n\nThen another.\n\nFinally, more than 48 hours later, Rowling came back on Twitter yesterday.\n\nBut not, it transpired, to delete the tweets that she now knew were 100% wrong.\n\nNo, instead she wished to rant about some deeply offensive comments made by an Irish newspaper columnist.\n\n\"This filth was published in the Sunday Times,\" she seethed. \"Let that sink in for a moment.\"\n\nI didn't have much time to let it sink in before the newspaper concerned deleted the column, profusely apologised and fired the journalist who wrote it.\n\nYet, incredibly, indignant Rowling saw no inconsistency in allowing her own deeply offensive tweets about Trump and the disabled boy to remain on her feed.\n\nEven the boy's mother pleaded with her to remove the tweets.\n\n\"Ummm,\" said Marjorie Kelly Weer in a Facebook post, \"if someone can please get a message to JK Rowling. Trump didn't snub my son & Monty wasn't even trying to shake his hand (1. He's 3 and hand shaking is not his thing. 2. He was showing off his newly acquired secret service patch). Thanks.\"\n\nBut this too fell on deaf, or stubborn ears.\n\nLast December, in yet another rant about Trump, JK Rowling made her feelings crystal clear about people who don't apologise for getting things wrong.\n\nShe did so by tweeting this quote from the 17th century French writer Francois de la Rochefoucauld: \"No people are more frequently wrong than those who will not admit they are wrong.\"\n\nIt has now been three days since JK Rowling posted a pack of lies about Donald Trump to her 11 million followers.\n\nShe knows it was wrong. We all know it was wrong.\n\nYet, as I write, she still refuses to delete the tweets, correct her lies, or apologise.\n\nEven if she does so now, perhaps after reading this column, the damage has been done.\n\nBy contrast, everyone else I have mentioned did remove their tweets once they realised the truth.\n\nHerz deleted, Olbermann deleted and Chelsea Clinton, when I brought it to her attention yesterday, also deleted.\n\nRowling, however, would prefer to continue using a three-year-old disabled boy to falsely smear Donald Trump, such is her blind hatred for the man.\n\nBy doing so, she is telling her millions of young impressionable Potter fans that it's absolutely fine to lie and never correct or apologise for a lie - after spending the past two years telling them that Trump is disgusting because he lies and never corrects or apologises for his lies.\n\nThis makes her a shameful, disgraceful hypocrite.\n\nNobody should believe a word this self-appointed High Priestess of Honesty ever says again, about anything.\n", "evaluation_span": [5701, 6110], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [5723, 5726], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 1, "span": [5776, 5779], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 2, "span": [5807, 5812], "entity_id": "Q22686", "name": "Donald Trump", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 3, "span": [5860, 5864], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY"}, {"id": 4, "span": [5877, 5880], "entity_id": "Q34660", "name": "J.

Photograph: David Jones/PA\n\nG4S, the controversial private security company, is to run services providing medical examinations and counselling for victims of rape and sexual assault in the West Midlands.\n\nThe company has been awarded a three-year contract to take over two sexual assault referral centres (Sarcs) in Birmingham and Walsall. The national network of 33 centres across England which have developed over the past decade also allow rape and sexual assault victims to report attacks without going to the police first.\n\nThe decision to award the contract for such sensitive services to the company, despite widespread criticism over its failings in the Olympics security contract, was made by local NHS commissioners who have recently taken over responsibility for the network of Sarcs from the police.\n\nUnion leaders and violence against women campaigners sharply criticised the \"sell-off\" of such sensitive services to a private company with such a chequered record.\n\nKaren Jennings, Unison's assistant general secretary, said: \"It is shocking that a private, profit-making company with such a chequered record should be put in charge of these highly sensitive and intimate support services. A woman at her most vulnerable must be treated with the ultimate respect, dignity and sensitivity by trained professionals who she feels confident about placing her trust in,\" she said.\n\n\"The police service has developed over the years experience and expertise in working with women at such difficult times. They have well-established links with supportive services and agencies and that progress should not be undermined by selling these services off.\"\n\nRape Crisis (England and Wales) said victims of sexual violence need to access long-term support and counselling as well as immediate medical and legal help: \"Our concern is that commissioning generic private contractors such as G4S to run Sarcs will lead to a focus on cost-efficiency above the needs of sexual violence victims and, in particular, that crucial long-term support services will be sacrificed in the name of cost-cutting.\"\n\nThe decision to give G4S the contract appears to follow complaints that the existing centre in the West Midlands had failed to meet official minimum standards for at least four years.\n\nG4S Forensic and Medical Services is already involved in providing similar services in Essex, Worcester and Telford. Women \"crisis workers\" staff the centres, assist with medical assessment and provide advice on follow-up services. G4S also provides women-only call handlers for dedicated phone lines for victims who contact Sarcs in Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire, Wiltshire and Hertfordshire. It also provides a specialist service for child victims of sexual abuse in Devon.\n\nThe company has recently advertised for \"female crisis workers\" to work at Sarcs at \u00a312.50 an hour and to be on call on a 24/7 rota.\n\nIn response to the criticism, Gary Green, managing director of G4S Forensic and Medical Services, said it has been working in this area since 2005 and had developed substantial expertise in providing a high standard of care while helping the police protect the evidence they need to secure a conviction: \"Our dedicated medical staff come from a range of backgrounds in health and social care and are absolutely committed to looking after the needs of the victim at what can be a very traumatic time. That's why we work with the local health services and the police to ensure that in the centres we manage, we have specially trained advocates focused solely on the welfare of those who come forward to report rape or sexual assault.\"\n\nAt the launch of the West Midlands G4S contracts earlier this week, Chief Superintendent Simon Hyde, the West Midlands police's head of public protection, said: \"Research and evidence stresses how important it is for victims to be able to access skilled, experienced forensic medical practitioners as part of the service, and that a high ratio of these physicians should be female.\n\n\"We wanted to bring the focus back on the service we provide to victims and have ensured that we have consulted with our partners and voluntary agencies to ensure the facilities provided through the NHS give the highest standards of victim care and treatment.\"\n", "evaluation_span": [1140, 2256], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [1140, 1154], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 1, "span": [1156, 1162], "entity_id": "Q3547264", "name": "UNISON", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 2, "span": [1165, 1192], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 3, "span": [1473, 1486], "entity_id": "Q1391344", "name": "specialist", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871"}, {"id": 4, "span": [1540, 1543], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 5, "span": [1819, 1850], "entity_id": "Q7293878", "name": "Rape Crisis England and Wales", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 6, "span": [1978, 1981], "entity_id": "Q7293878", "name": "Rape Crisis England and Wales", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 7, "span": [2048, 2051], "entity_id": "Q1322045", "name": "G4S", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}]}

Each year the Library of Congress adds 25 more films that must be at least 10 years old, in order to \"safeguard\" American-made films.\n\nNational Public Radio reported Wednesday that the announced selections should mirror American culture as \"compositions of consequence.\"\n\nDiverse genres, length and style of film comprise the 25 the Library of Congress selected, such as Jurassic Park (1993), Disney's 1950 classic Cinderella, Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain (2005), the Rex Harrison-Audrey Hepburn musical My Fair Lady (1964), Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca (1940), Field of Dreams (1989), the Generation X favorite The Goonies (1985) and The Shining (1980), the Stanley Kubrick horror flick starring Jack Nicholson.\n\nLibrarian of Congress Carla Hayden said: \"These cinematic treasures must be protected because they document our history, culture, hopes and dreams.\"\n\nSelection criteria for the registry focus on \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\" films. Historically, the National Film Registry includes American company-produced films, \"typically for theatrical release or recognized as a film through film festivals or film awards,\" reads the Library of Congress website. The purpose is to \"safeguard\" U.S. films.\n\nThe registry originated in 1989, when some of the first films chosen included undeniably classic The Wizard of Oz (1939), Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958), Singing in the Rain (1952), On the Waterfront with Marlon Brando (1954), Star Wars (1977) and a slew of Academy Award winning movies.\n\nThe new crop boasts a broader selection, including a short film, Hair Piece: A Film for Nappy Headed People (1984) and Smoke Signals (1998), the first-ever Native American-written, directed, co-produced and acted movie.\n\nIn a democratic show of hands, the Library of Congress gleans ongoing nominations from the public. To glimpse a list of suggested movies - listed by year - that you may want to nominate for next year's list, the library posts an online nomination form.\n\n\"Please do vote,\" reads the page. \"Films that receive the most support each year are given special consideration during the process by members of the National Film Preservation Board.\"\n\nThat means that films released in 2009 are now eligible for consideration, ranging back to 1890. If you have a special fondness for Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel, Angels and Demons, Fantastic Mr. Fox, Julie and Julia, The Hangover, Monsters vs. Aliens or any preceding year's film, now is your chance to vote - up to 50 times per year.\n\nHere's the full list of the 2018 additions:\n\nBad Day at Black Rock (1955)\n\nBroadcast News (1987)\n\nBrokeback Mountain (2005)\n\nCinderella (1950)\n\nDays of Wine and Roses (1962)\n\nDixon-Wanamaker Expedition to Crow Agency (1908)\n\nEve's Bayou (1997)\n\nThe Girl Without a Soul (1917)\n\nHair Piece: A Film for Nappy-Headed People (1984)\n\nHearts and Minds (1974)\n\nHud (1963)\n\nThe Informer (1935)\n\nJurassic Park (1993)\n\nThe Lady From Shanghai (1947)\n\nLeave Her to Heaven (1945)\n\nMonterey Pop (1968)\n\nMy Fair Lady (1964)\n\nThe Navigator (1924)\n\nOn the Town (1949)\n\nOne-Eyed Jacks (1961)\n\nPickup on South Street (1953)\n\nRebecca (1940)\n\nThe Shining (1980)\n\nSmoke Signals (1998)\n\nSomething Good - Negro Kiss (1898)\n", "evaluation_span": [3295, 3363], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [3295, 3309], "entity_id": "Q174513", "name": "One-Eyed Jacks", "type": "Q17537576|Q2424752"}, {"id": 1, "span": [3311, 3315], "entity_id": "DATETIME", "name": "Unknown", "type": "DATETIME"}, {"id": 2, "span": [3318, 3340], "entity_id": "Q1311296", "name": "Pickup on South Street", "type": "Q17537576|Q2424752"}, {"id": 3, "span": [3342, 3346], "entity_id": "DATETIME", "name": "Unknown", "type": "DATETIME"}, {"id": 4, "span": [3349, 3356], "entity_id": "Q204212", "name": "Rebecca", "type": "Q17537576|Q2424752"}, {"id": 5, "span": [3358, 3362], "entity_id": "DATETIME", "name": "Unknown", "type": "DATETIME"}]}

I don't need that amount of money, it's too much for me,' the man told officials.\n\n'I'm going to share the prize money with my family. I'll make sure it doesn't change who I am but I'll definitely be able to live a better lifestyle, with a few more toys.\n\n'I love being out on the water so I'll buy myself a boat and a jet ski, and my kids have been wanting the new iPhone 6 so they can have that now and I might spoil them each with a new car,' the anonymous man said.\n\nMr Baron was in charge of collecting $20 from each syndicate member to purchase lottery tickets on behalf of the group, according to a writ filed last year.\n\nThere was an understanding any winnings would be split equally between all members.\n\nMembers of the Syndicate, who said they were friends with Baron, told A Current Affair they questioned him about his recent lavish purchases.\n\n'I said \"you haven't pulled off the Powerball and haven't told us or anything have ya?\" and he just goes \"nah, nah\" and he just laughed and walked away,' one of men in the syndicate said.\n\n'Winning Tatts lotto is like, everybody dreams of it, that it only happened to the lucky few once in a while, this was our shot, and it's gone - he took it away from us.'\n\nThe 14 syndicate members only learned the truth about Baron's newfound wealth after one of his Toll colleagues delivered him a congratulatory bottle of champagne from Tattslotto.\n\nThe civil trial ended on the same day it began in the Victorian Supreme Court on Wednesday. It was expected to carry on for five days.\n\n'Things have changed a bit,' Justice Kim Hargrave said after counsel for the group suing Mr Baron advised the court the case had been resolved.\n\nIt is understood each of the members wanted around $1 million in a pay-out but may get less than a quarter of that, according to A Current Affair.\n", "evaluation_span": [2819, 3247], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [2844, 2856], "entity_id": "DATETIME", "name": "Unknown", "type": "DATETIME"}, {"id": 1, "span": [2873, 2896], "entity_id": "Q4109092", "name": "Supreme Court of Victoria", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 2, "span": [2900, 2909], "entity_id": "DATETIME", "name": "Unknown", "type": "DATETIME"}, {"id": 3, "span": [2943, 2947], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY"}, {"id": 4, "span": [2984, 3004], "entity_id": "Q16729644", "name": "Kim Hargrave", "type": "Q215627", "children": [5, 7]}, {"id": 5, "span": [2984, 2991], "entity_id": "Q56060731", "name": "Justice of the Victorian Supreme Court", "type": "Q4164871", "parent": 4, "children": [6]}, {"id": 6, "span": [2984, 2991], "entity_id": "Q16533", "name": "judge", "type": "Q12737077|Q215627|Q4164871", "parent": 5}, {"id": 7, "span": [2992, 3004], "entity_id": "Q16729644", "name": "Kim Hargrave", "type": "Q215627", "parent": 4, "children": [6]}, {"id": 8, "span": [3016, 3023], "entity_id": "Q17131110", "name": "counsel", "type": "Q12737077|Q215627|Q4164871"}, {"id": 9, "span": [3044, 3052], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 10, "span": [3061, 3070], "entity_id": "Q4109092", "name": "Supreme Court of Victoria", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 11, "span": [3152, 3161], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY"}, {"id": 12, "span": [3229, 3245], "entity_id": "Q4656226", "name": "A Current Affair", "type": "Q17537576|Q2424752"}]}

A look at coverage and plans in her honor:\n\nLooking back on the film that spotlighted Ginsburg worldwide, and offered intimate insight for young people, one of the CNN executives who shepherded the 2018 release pointed to the justice's cultural relevance.\n\n\"We greenlit the film because of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's extraordinary legacy in equal rights and her stature within our national culture,\" Amy Entelis, executive vice president for talent and content development for CNN Worldwide, told The Associated Press in an email Saturday.\n\n\"We never expected the film to generate the reaction that it did. Many people were unfamiliar with her pre-judicial career as a lawyer for the ACLU and how she played such an essential role in securing equal rights, particularly for women, which meant all Americans benefited,\" she wrote. \"The stories of her personal struggle to become an attorney makes her singular contributions to the law that much more poignant.

She taught us all so much. I will miss her deeply.\"\n\nOther distribution plans for the movie were pending Saturday.\n\nTributes and re-broadcasts are trending on streaming services and the apps of major networks, with more to come.\n\nPlans for \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" beginning at 9 a.m. Eastern, include journalist Erin Moriarty looking back on the life and times of the judge.

Pantone has declared Ultra Violet the shade of 2018, so expect to see it on make-up counters in everything from eyeliner to lipstick.\n\nIf that feels a step too far, try a violet nail polish. Nailberry's L'Oxygene Polish in Extravagant (\u00a314.50, nailberry.co.uk) ensures nails won't dry out, or for a deeper shade, try YSL La Laque Couture Nail Polish in Violet Baroque (\u00a319.50, yslbeauty.co.uk).\n\nI love L'Oreal Color Riche Oil Nail Polish in Violet Vendome (\u00a34.95, nailpolishdirect.co.uk), a rich, vibrant hue.\n\n\nAll eyes have been on Meghan Markle and her glowing skin since her engagement.\n\nSo it's nice to hear she loves a multi-tasking bargain just as much as the rest of us.

Try Thursday Plantation Tea Tree Oil (\u00a39.99, Boots).\n\n\nIt's always tempting to relax in a long, hot bath - especially on a day like today. But it is not such good news for your complexion. Hot water strips the natural oils and moisture from your skin, leaving it parched, dry and even scaly. This can also lead to more wrinkles, as drier skin tends to crease more readily.\n\nTry to resist using water that is too hot, and limit baths or showers to 15 minutes tops. Most importantly, make sure you add a moisturising product to the water.\n\nBramley Bubble Bath (\u00a312, bramley products.co.uk) contains geranium and lavender, with sweet orange essential oils. It's gentle and gets to work hydrating the skin while you relax.\n\n\nIf you feel like your complexion needs extra help to counteract overindulgence and revive dull skin (who doesn't at this time of year) Chanel's new palette is your secret weapon.\n\nThe Palette Essentielle (\u00a352, chanel.com) contains a blush, a concealer and a highlighter in natural, complementary colours to hide blemishes and give cheeks a glow.\n\n\nIn your 50s: Perfect for brightening under the eyes, Rimmel Wake Me Up Concealer (\u00a36.49, Boots) can also be used on pigmentation. Pat over your foundation with the applicator and blend with your finger.\n\nIn your 60s: MUA Cover and Conceal Wand (\u00a31.50, Superdrug) should be used before applying foundation for long-lasting coverage. It works particularly well on thread veins or dark under-eye shadows.\n\nIn your 70s: Available in 12 shades, NYX Studio Photogenic Wand Concealer (\u00a36, Debenhams) works for most skin tones. It brightens and camouflages and even comes in a green shade to neutralise redness.\n\n\nJanuary is when our immune systems most need a boost to ward off coughs and colds.\n\nEchinacea has been shown to aid the body's defence against germs and now - thanks to Fresh cosmetics - the immune boosting plant extract can benefit our skin, too.\n\nThe Fresh Creme Ancienne Ultimate Nourishing Honey Mask (\u00a3116 John Lewis) uses echinacea to detoxify, and pure honey to help seal in moisture, soften skin and improve elasticity.\n\nApply to dampened face, leave on for 10 minutes, then rinse as normal.

The flight is paid for by taxpayers and will cost around \u00a33,500.\n\nBut dignitaries and flag-waving wellwishers were left shivering in the cold as her pilot waited for a break in the weather.\n\nMany grumbled that the foggy conditions had been known about well in advance and asked why Kate had not simply taken the train, a three-and-a-half hour journey which costs \u00a342.50 each way.\n\nA St James's Palace spokesman said: \"A number of factors are taken into consideration when deciding on transport, including cost, practicality and security arrangements and what the member of the Royal Family is doing before and after the engagement.\"\n\nCatherine, Duchess of Cambridge greets children in Grimsby, England.

{"id": 2015812096, "title": "20150211 - Bill Shorten and the chamber of petulance", "text": "Bill Shorten and the chamber of petulance\n\nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten in Parliament on Wednesday.\n\nPhoto: Alex Ellinghausen\n\nIf puerile nastiness entertains you, or watching adults behave like petulant adolescents, then Federal Parliament was the show to watch this week. Anyone who witnessed question time, especially from inside the chamber, would have seen small-mindedness triumphant. If Australia is suffering from a failure of political leadership, causing a loss of business confidence and investment, then that failure is clearly bi-partisan.\n\nWith a precipitous decline in revenue as the price of all our major energy exports have plunged, and the Senate serving as a chamber where budget cuts go to die, Australia has a real challenge in finding new sources of revenue and new ways of curbing spending. The government has made efforts, and most of them have been rebuffed in the Senate and rejected by the public. New measures are needed. The time for posturing is over.\n\nIf Australia is suffering from a failure of political leadership, causing a loss of business confidence and investment, then that failure is clearly bi-partisan.\n\nYet this is what the alternate leader of the nation, Bill Shorten had to offer on the first day of Parliament in 2015:\n\nQuestion one: \"Given that nearly half of his parliamentary colleagues, including two-thirds of his Liberal backbenchers, have today expressed a lack of confidence in the Prime Minister, how can the Prime Minister claim to have a mandate from this country?\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo: \"Is the Prime Minister planning to abandon any of his budget measures? Or is he just planning to abandon his Treasurer, as he did at the press conference today?\"\n\nThree: \"I refer to the Liberal member for Brisbane's perceptive comments yesterday: We cannot govern ourselves in an internal climate of fear and intimidation. And that is the unacceptable situation we have endured for the past five years. Does the Prime Minister agree with the member for Brisbane?\"\n\nFour: \"My question is to the Minister for Communications [Malcolm Turnbull]. Minister, why are you still on the front bench?\"\n\nThe answers were (question one) no; (question two) yes; (question three) no; (question four) because I'm not a treacherous back-stabber who helped bring down both leaders I have served under.\n\nMr Shorten then moved a no-confidence motion in the Prime Minister, yet devoted much of his energy to a gratuitous personal attack on Turnbull: \"He, the Zorro of the dispatch box, has said that he wants the job but he will not fight for the job. He is prepared to injure his Prime Minister but he leaves his supporters hanging. He is a veritable ball of ambivalence!\"\n\nAnd so on. Shorten will not be remembered for his wit.\n\nThis week was an opportunity for him to display that he was a better man than the Prime Minister, that he was more than a vindictive point-scorer, that he had policies to address the nation's drift into debt and deficit. He did not take that opportunity. He missed it completely.\n\nThen there were the voyeurs of the opposition, the members waving goodbye to the Prime Minister and Treasurer Joe Hockey. They were led from the front row by Jenny Macklin, who, you would think, would know better, having reached her 60s and been in parliament for 19 years. Nineteen years in which six Labor leaders were deposed in eight leadership changes, with all but Paul Keating departing at the behest of their own colleagues (Kim Beazley, Simon Crean, Mark Latham, Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard).\n\nThe Dummy-Spit Award for the most childish member of the house was a tie between Pat Conroy and Nick Champion, both former union officials and both serial brats. Labor breeds haters. It is famous for that. Even the most colourless in its ranks, like Macklin, can revel in pettiness.\n\nObserving all this was the omnipresent, non-partisan political editor of Sky News, David Speers, who, after noting the bilious gloating of the opposition, also noted that karma had come back to bite the Prime Minister. He pointed out that Abbott had baited Gillard with some similarly goading questions after she had suffered political near-death at the hands of her colleagues.\n\nKarma is also repaying Abbott for his ingloriously unwise comment that \"the adults are back in charge.\"\n\nTuesday was more of the same. Shorten's first question: \"If good government starts today, what on earth has the Prime Minister been doing for the past 521 days?\"\n\nIn summary, the second sitting day of 2015 was almost identical to the first. Unedifying.\n\nWednesday, however, was different. Shorten asked a series of constructive, penetrating questions. Perhaps feedback had come back that he had gone too far, been too nasty, too petty, and his gloating had been bad optics.\n\nTwitter: Paul_Sheehan_\n", "evaluation_span": [2332, 3036], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [2332, 2342], "entity_id": "Q4910865", "name": "Bill Shorten", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 1, "span": [2380, 2398], "entity_id": "Q348577", "name": "Tony Abbott", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 2, "span": [2420, 2423], "entity_id": "Q4910865", "name": "Bill Shorten", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 3, "span": [2466, 2474], "entity_id": "Q927550", "name": "Malcolm Turnbull", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 4, "span": [2477, 2479], "entity_id": "Q927550", "name": "Malcolm Turnbull", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 5, "span": [2485, 2490], "entity_id": "Q226822", "name": "Zorro", "type": "Q17537576|Q215627"}, {"id": 6, "span": [2526, 2528], "entity_id": "Q927550", "name": "Malcolm Turnbull", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 7, "span": [2535, 2542], "entity_id": "Q319145", "name": "Prime Minister of Australia", "type": "Q4164871"}, {"id": 8, "span": [2547, 2549], "entity_id": "Q927550", "name": "Malcolm Turnbull", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 9, "span": [2569, 2576], "entity_id": "Q319145", "name": "Prime Minister of Australia", "type": "Q4164871"}, {"id": 10, "span": [2578, 2580], "entity_id": "Q927550", "name": "Malcolm Turnbull", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 11, "span": [2603, 2621], "entity_id": "Q348577", "name": "Tony Abbott", "type": "Q215627", "children": [12, 13]}, {"id": 12, "span": [2603, 2606], "entity_id": "Q927550", "name": "Malcolm Turnbull", "type": "Q215627", "parent": 11}, {"id": 13, "span": [2607, 2621], "entity_id": "Q319145", "name": "Prime Minister of Australia", "type": "Q4164871", "parent": 11}, {"id": 14, "span": [2626, 2628], "entity_id": "Q927550", "name": "Malcolm Turnbull", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 15, "span": [2636, 2639], "entity_id": "Q927550", "name": "Malcolm Turnbull", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 16, "span": [2660, 2662], "entity_id": "Q927550", "name": "Malcolm Turnbull", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 17, "span": [2712, 2719], "entity_id": "Q4910865", "name": "Bill Shorten", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 18, "span": [2747, 2750], "entity_id": "Q4910865", "name": "Bill Shorten", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 19, "span": [2757, 2766], "entity_id": "DATETIME", "name": "Unknown", "type": "DATETIME"}, {"id": 20, "span": [2790, 2793], "entity_id": "Q4910865", "name": "Bill Shorten", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 21, "span": [2810, 2812], "entity_id": "Q4910865", "name": "Bill Shorten", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 22, "span": [2835, 2853], "entity_id": "Q348577", "name": "Tony Abbott", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 23, "span": [2860, 2862], "entity_id": "Q4910865", "name": "Bill Shorten", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 24, "span": [2909, 2911], "entity_id": "Q4910865", "name": "Bill Shorten", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 25, "span": [2936, 2946], "entity_id": "Q408", "name": "Australia", "type": "Q27096213|Q4164871|Q43229"}, {"id": 26, "span": [2978, 2980], "entity_id": "Q4910865", "name": "Bill Shorten", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 27, "span": [3012, 3014], "entity_id": "Q4910865", "name": "Bill Shorten", "type": "Q215627"}]}

As the trail appeared to go cold, there was speculation that someone else was involved - or that the burning car was a decoy.\n\nSecurity was stepped up across southern California and there were long delays at the US-Mexico border as every vehicle was searched.\n\nBut it appears he was hiding out in one of the hundreds of mountain cabins in the centre of town - just half a mile from the police control centre.\n\n\"We haven't had so much excitement around here in 20 years since that armed bank robbery,\" one local said, getting a coffee as this tourist city 7,000ft (2,133m) up in the mountains could finally relax.\n\nRon White, from Big Bear Donuts, said the locals weren't afraid: \"He was targeting police, not us.\"\n\nPlease turn on JavaScript.

{"id": 2013390195, "title": "20130608 - Turkey protests pose a new threat to Syria peace efforts", "text": "Turkey protests pose a new threat to Syria peace efforts\n\nEuropeans are worried Turkey's controversial handling of protests over a minor urban development in Istanbul is damaging the whole EU-NATO peacemaking and security project in Syria.\n\nISTANBUL, Turkey, June 7 (UPI) -- Europeans are worried Turkey's handling of protests over a minor urban development in Istanbul is damaging the whole EU-NATO peacemaking and security project in Syria.\n\nTurkey has staked its reputation as a non-partisan, non-Arab arbiter of disputes and flare-ups in its neighborhood and as the modern inheritor of the mantle of the old Ottoman Empire.\n\nArabs tolerated Turkey's role as a mediator and facilitator despite strong reservations about Ottoman rule over their lands before independence or creation of modern Arab states, preferring it to British and French mandates.\n\nBut Turkey bared new ambitions during the turmoil in Iraq after the 2003 allied invasion that brought down Saddam Hussein and more recently in Syria, both former colonies of its Ottoman predecessors.\n\nAs Syria plunged deeper into strife and thousands of Syrians sought refuge in southeastern Turkey, Ankara could convincingly argue it had a stake in Syria's future.\n\nEurope saw Turkey as a valuable rear guard as it tried to shield itself from political and security fallout from Syria. As the Syrian conflict threatened to spill over into Turkey along with the fleeing multitudes, European defense commanders promptly sent and installed Patriot missile batteries along Turkey's Syrian border.\n\nBut it all appeared to be going wrong as Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, riding high approval ratings amid what Turks saw as their country's resurgence as a regional power, began to implement a long-cherished Islamization of the country's deeply entrenched secular society.\n\nLast month authorities began shutting down establishments that served alcohol or what Erdogan aides saw as the lewd westernization of society. With his popularity on the rise, Erdogan easily silenced critics who saw his measures as an attempt to recast Turkey after his own Islamist model.\n\nTurks in general are not against some Islamic elements marking day-to-day pursuits and lifestyle that link them to their heritage and tradition, but most draw a line at what they see as going beyond \"moderation\" -- a term open to heated debate over the decades since Kemal Ataturk ushered in the republic in 1922.\n\nErdogan is adamant that forces inimical to his rule rather than Turkish masses turned the Istanbul protests into a movement increasingly questioning his legitimacy.\n\nHe also shocked European partners by insisting his handling of the protests was mild compared to what EU partners would have done in similar circumstances.\n\nEuropean criticism of Erdogan has been sharp but cautiously coded.\n\nThe protests have also demonstrated that, through years of exposure to mainland Europe and yearning for Turkey's eventual entry into the club of nations, Turks are more Europeanized than the ruling party's ideologues.\n\nMost Turks see the government's conduct as indicative of its eastward push rather than a westward reach to Europe and democratic values enshrined in EU rules for letting new members in.\n\nTurkey has been vying for EU entry since 2005 but lags behind almost everyone being considered as part of EU enlargement. The eight new potential entrants are Albania, Bosnia, Croatia, Iceland, Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey.\n\nEU Enlargement Minister Stefan Fuele, who was in Istanbul for talks, delivered a public reproach.\n\n\"Peaceful demonstrations constitute a legitimate way for groups to express their views in a democratic society,\" Fuele said.\n\n\"Excessive use of force by police against these demonstrations has no place in such a democracy.\"\n\nThe widely publicized chastisement was music to the ears of Erdogan's many foes on the right, left and center of Turkey's volatile political spectrum. The civil strife complicates Turkey's overt support for Syria's armed opposition, based in Istanbul, and a dangerous balancing act with eastern Kurdish factions known to have strong links with armed groups in Syria, Iraq and Iran.\n\nTurkey is a major player in international peacemaking efforts now under way in Syria, involving negotiators from the EU, the United Nations, Russia, the United States and the Arab world.\n\nErdogan has banked on continued popularity, a robust economy and a strong power base within the political establishment, but his response to the protests threatens to change all that.\n\nIstanbul and the southwestern tourism belt were the worst hit after the protests, with hotels reporting mass cancellations. Turkey's service sector provides the bulk of the national earnings -- up to 63 percent according to latest data.\n\nAs the sixth most popular tourism destination in the world, Turkey drew 31 million tourists in 2011. This week the Turkish stock market was reeling under the impact of the protests. Analysts predicted job losses in the service sector, a potent new flashpoint.\n", "evaluation_span": [3574, 4180], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [3687, 3692], "entity_id": "Q370164", "name": "\u0160tefan F\u00fcle", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 1, "span": [3786, 3795], "entity_id": "Q7174", "name": "democracy", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 2, "span": [3859, 3866], "entity_id": "Q39259", "name": "Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 3, "span": [3912, 3918], "entity_id": "Q43", "name": "Turkey", "type": "Q27096213|Q4164871|Q43229"}, {"id": 4, "span": [3979, 3985], "entity_id": "Q43", "name": "Turkey", "type": "Q27096213|Q4164871|Q43229"}, {"id": 5, "span": [4006, 4011], "entity_id": "Q858", "name": "Syria", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 6, "span": [4041, 4049], "entity_id": "Q406", "name": "Istanbul", "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 7, "span": [4094, 4101], "entity_id": "Q12223", "name": "Kurds", "type": "Q33829"}, {"id": 8, "span": [4159, 4164], "entity_id": "Q858", "name": "Syria", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 9, "span": [4166, 4170], "entity_id": "Q796", "name": "Iraq", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 10, "span": [4175, 4179], "entity_id": "Q794", "name": "Iran", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}]}

Most needs to be toasted with a slight burned area. I was a Girl Scout.'\n\nSome others shared stronger opinions on the topic of toasting marshmallows, as one woman said: 'Anyone who chooses one-six must have some real issues in their lives......or they could be diagnosed with ADHD.'\n\n'Always disturbed me, the people who set their marshmallows on fire. Like damn, be patient,' another said.\n\nMeanwhile, one user shared a small 'guide' of their own, as he jokingly detailed what he believes is the meaning behind each marshmallow.\n\n'One-two is a waste of a stick. Three-four is what you give the kids who really want one but are doing what their told.\n\n'Five-six is good seven-eight is being thankful it didn't turn into... nine-ten is a waste of a stick, do not eat that trash,' he added.\n\nAnother said: 'Dude, no.

This developed into restriction, purging and over-exercising.\n\nShe continued: 'When I began to lose weight unhealthily, I was awarded with multiple lead roles for the first time and placed in the highest level.\n\n'This fuelled my disorder and only made me more determined to get sicker.'\n\nBy the time she graduated, Anais was battling a severe eating disorder and was hospitalised during her first year of university.\n\nShe was forced to give up ballet and gained 20lbs. However 18 months after she returned to dance she suffered a 'very deadly relapse'.\n\nShe said: 'I was devastated because after all the sacrifice and work, I had regressed to a point even lower than before.\n\n'This time it was different. No longer was I purging, abusing laxatives, or over exercising. This time I simply refused to eat; it was anorexia at its worst.\n\n'I would dance for hours with nothing in my system, and I would rely on caffeine to get me through each day.'\n\nHer turning point came when she was rushed to the emergency room after collapsing on a photo shoot.\n\nShe said: 'I felt really weak and delirious however, I wasn't scared. I thought I was going to die and I felt at peace knowing that I wouldn't suffer anymore from my eating disorder.\n\n'It's sad to say but at the time I wouldn't have minded dying. I felt bad that my mum had to see me so sick. This event really woke me up to the reality of my disorder.'\n\nAnais pledged to gain weight, saying she was 'fueled by her anger, determination and fear'.\n\nShe forced herself to meal prep and up her calories each week until she had reached 2000 calories a day.\n\nShe added: 'The most important thing I did was rest. My body had a lot to catch up on, so I slept for weeks.\n\n'Slowly but surely my energy began returning and my weight began increasing.\n\n'I only weighed myself at the doctor's office because I refused to be a slave to the scale in my own house considering I use to weigh myself after each meal.'\n\nNow she is reclaiming control over her life both mentally and physically.\n\nShe said: 'In the past, I would turn down invitations, parties, meals, anything that possibly involved food.\n\n'Now, I am rediscovering life and it's many benefits. I eat cake once in a while, and go out with friends when asked.\n\n'I also recently started my blog to share my story and hopefully help others.'\n\nDespite reaching a healthy weight, she admits she has further to go.\n\nShe added: 'I am heading in the right direction. I am only going to recover as much as my determination allows, and as of now I refuse to die.\n\n'I am on a mission to recover fully and help others one day.'\n", "evaluation_span": [481, 944], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [485, 500], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 1, "span": [564, 571], "entity_id": "Q805221", "name": "ballet dancer", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871"}, {"id": 2, "span": [622, 627], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 3, "span": [699, 707], "entity_id": "Q48282", "name": "student", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871"}, {"id": 4, "span": [842, 845], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 5, "span": [853, 854], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 6, "span": [885, 887], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}]}

They've played pretty well throughout and we have enormous respect for them.\n\n\"They have a massive enthusiasm, cohesion up front and an ability to stay in the game for 80 minutes, which has not always been the case.\n\n\"Any momentary lapse in concentration could cause us lots of problems.\"\n\nWith prop Vickery starting the game on the bench following his two-game ban, Martin Corry will skipper the side.\n\nAnd the Leicester forward says the team will not make the mistake of underestimating Tonga.\n\n\"We are going to have to win the game, and we expect to win the game, but that is taking nothing away from Tonga,\" he said.\n\n\"They are coming into this game full of confidence, but we are just focusing on ourselves and looking to improve on what we did against Samoa.\"\n\nAshton has made some bold choices in his selection, leaving Vickery on the bench and bringing Lewis Moody in at open-side flanker for his first start of the tournament.\n\nBut Jonny Wilkinson will continue his half-back partnership with scrum-half Andy Gomarsall.\n\nWilkinson missed the first two games of the tournament because of an ankle injury but kicked 24 points on his return as England beat Samoa.\n\nHe now needs another 22 points to become the record points scorer in World Cups, eclipsing the 227 amassed by Scotland great Gavin Hastings.\n\nEngland and Tonga have met only once before in an officially recognised Test. It came in the 1999 World Cup, with England easing to a 101-10 victory.\n\nBut this time round promises to be a lot closer, with Latu promising: \"We are going to throw the kitchen sink at England.\n\n\"People back home have been over the moon with what we have done, and it is rewarding for us to see where the country is now. Even being here is bringing Tongans together as one, but it's not just for us.\n\n\"We are here to do a job and change the face of rugby in the Islands, and in Tonga especially.\"\n\nThe Tongans had planned to take to the field with their hair dyed green to thank an Irish bookmaker for supporting them financially in France.\n\nBut the International Rugby Board says that would constitute advertising and has ordered Tonga not to go ahead with the publicity stunt.\n\nEngland: Lewsey; Sackey, Tait, Barkley, Cueto; Wilkinson, Gomarsall; Sheridan, Chuter, Stevens, Borthwick, Kay, Corry (capt), Moody, Easter\nReplacements: Mears, Vickery, Dallaglio, Worsley, Richards, Farrell, Hipkiss.\n\nTonga: Lilo; Tu'ifua, Hufanga, Taione, Vaka; Hola, Tu'ipulotu; Tonga'uiha, Lutui, Pulu, Vaki, Fa'aoso, T-Pole, Latu (capt), Maka\nReplacements: Taukafa, Taufa'ao Filise, Molitika, Afeaki, Havea, Huson Tonga'uiha, Havili.\n", "evaluation_span": [2306, 2738], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [2306, 2315], "entity_id": "Q318920", "name": "Jonny Wilkinson", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 1, "span": [2327, 2332], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY"}, {"id": 2, "span": [2333, 2336], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY"}, {"id": 3, "span": [2346, 2360], "entity_id": "Q124753", "name": "2007 Rugby World Cup", "type": "Q1656682"}, {"id": 4, "span": [2399, 2401], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY"}, {"id": 5, "span": [2412, 2415], "entity_id": "Q318920", "name": "Jonny Wilkinson", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 6, "span": [2426, 2433], "entity_id": "Q378628", "name": "England national rugby union team", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 7, "span": [2439, 2444], "entity_id": "Q3590539", "name": "Samoa national rugby league team", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 8, "span": [2447, 2449], "entity_id": "Q318920", "name": "Jonny Wilkinson", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 9, "span": [2468, 2470], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY"}, {"id": 10, "span": [2516, 2526], "entity_id": "Q16640", "name": "Rugby World Cup", "type": "Q1656682"}, {"id": 11, "span": [2542, 2545], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY"}, {"id": 12, "span": [2557, 2565], "entity_id": "Q945016", "name": "Scotland national rugby union team", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 13, "span": [2572, 2586], "entity_id": "Q427291", "name": "Gavin Hastings", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 14, "span": [2589, 2596], "entity_id": "Q378628", "name": "England national rugby union team", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 15, "span": [2601, 2606], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 16, "span": [2682, 2696], "entity_id": "Q1141048", "name": "1999 Rugby World Cup", "type": "Q1656682"}, {"id": 17, "span": [2703, 2710], "entity_id": "Q378628", "name": "England national rugby union team", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 18, "span": [2723, 2726], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY"}, {"id": 19, "span": [2727, 2729], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY"}]}
