Rowan Pelling answers your questions about sex

QUESTION: I've been seeing my partner for five months and feel we have a long-term future, so are discussing changing our method of contraception. We've been using condoms, but my boyfriend wants me to go on the Pill. I don't want to go back to it aged 48, when my chances of getting pregnant are almost non-existent. Wouldn't the rhythm method be sufficient?

ANSWER: Now here's an ironic thing: if you were trying to fall pregnant at the age of 48, the medics would tell you that your chances of doing so naturally were rather less than those of being hit by an asteroid.

Suggest, however, that you're thinking of being laidback about contraception because you're far too old to conceive and the story changes dramatically. Everyone will cite a woman they know on the far side of her 40s who stopped bothering with protection and suddenly found herself knocked up.

<START>They might also mention the fact that middle-aged women are the fastest-growing demographic seeking abortions, and that much of what's said about female fertility is wrong.

So, when [COREF:Q7371805|I] tell [COREF:Unknown1|you] to be cautious, [COREF:Q7371805|I] really mean it. If [COREF:Unknown1|you]'re going to try the rhythm method, [COREF:Unknown1|you] need to be careful monitoring your temperature and ovulation.

[COREF:Unknown1|You] also need to be prepared to exercise extreme self-control during fertile periods - which is also when [COREF:Unknown1|you]'ll be feeling most desire. Good luck with that.<END>

None of this means that you have to go back on the Pill. There's a wide range of alternatives. The popular Mirena coil releases smaller doses of hormones than the contraceptive Pill and safeguards against pregnancy for five years.

I would advise a trip to your nearest family planning clinic, where a specialist will talk you through all the best options.

Channing Tatum pens sweet essay about his daughter Everly

Channing Tatum wants his daughter to be just like her mom Jenna Dewan.

The Magic Mike hunk penned a sweet essay for the June issue of Cosmopolitan magazine, where he opened up about his love for his wife and their three-year-old daughter.

'One day, Jenna just blurted out that she knew exactly what she wanted in life and she didn't have to look for it anymore because it was me... I remember feeling this incredible rush - it was the sexiest thing she'd ever done for me,' the 37-year-old wrote.

Speaking about his wife of eight years, Channing says it was her strength and honesty which made him fall for her.

**** ARTICLE #4: 20130324 - Commentary: Who says public schools need more money? (None) *****
Commentary: Who says public schools need more money?

Editor's note: Ben Chavis is the co-author with Carey Blakely of "Crazy Like A Fox: One Principal's Triumph in the Inner City." Chavis received his doctorate in education and philosophy from the University of Arizona and served as principal of American Indian Public Charter School for seven years. Chavis has also worked as a real estate investor. Currently, he is replicating the model he established at American Indian Public Charter School in various schools throughout the U.S. and Canada.

Educator Ben Chavis says money isn't enough to improve schools run by incompetent administrators.

(CNN) -- Teachers unions and politicians are constantly claiming that K-12 public schools need more money in order to produce good academic results. But does the data support the argument that our schools need more money to succeed?

The Oakland Unified School District had a budget of $602 million for the 2008-2009 school year, according to Katy Murphy, an education reporter with the Oakland Tribune. That budget, which includes $77 million spent on consultants, means that the district spends an average of $16,270 per student!

What have we, the public taxpayers, received for our exceptionally generous financial support of the Oakland public schools? According to the California Department of Education, the district's reported 2008 California Standardized Test scores show:

1. Of 707 eighth- and ninth-graders who took the California Standard test for general math: 1 percent tested advanced, 5 percent tested proficient and 94 percent failed by testing below grade level. See details about K-12 schools, teachers "

2. Of 2,506 ninth- and 10th-grade students who took the California Standards test in algebra: 0 percent tested advanced, 3 percent tested proficient and 97 percent failed the test.

How is it possible for a public school system to so liberally spend more than half a billion dollars and still fail to educate 94 percent or more students of all racial backgrounds? Does anyone believe providing more money to these public school systems will enhance these students' academic performance in mathematics?

During my principalship at American Indian Public Charter School, we spent less than $8,000 per student, proving that schools did not need more money. We served a student population that is on average 98 percent minority, with 97 percent receiving free or reduced-price lunch and many who are non-English speakers and from single-parent families. AIPCS students spend three to four hours a day working on mathematics and English-language arts.

In 2009, they excelled in academics, physical fitness and any standardized test that they were given. The hard work of these students and staff has paid off with virtually all of our eighth-graders testing advanced in algebra, including 100 percent of our eighth-grade black students, Mexican-American students and American Indian students.

Before I became its principal, people called American Indian Public Charter School the zoo. The neighbors hated it. They couldn't stand the behavior of the students, who, with little supervision or control, wreaked havoc in the area.

Unfortunately, the students who decided to attend the school did not receive the academics and structure they so direly needed. The school was in many ways a failure, a joke, a sham.

When I took over as principal in 2000, it was the worst middle school in Oakland. I told the board I would take the job only if they let me go my own way and do what I thought was best. I implemented a golden rule at American Indian Public Charter School for staff, students and families: If you act like a winner, you'll be treated like a winner. If you act like a fool, you'll be treated like a fool. The charter school is now one of the top-scoring schools in the state and is nationally recognized.

The United States spends more money on public education than any other country in the world. Yet, we still have a secondary public education system that ranks with Third World countries in preparing our children in English-language arts, mathematics, science and social studies.

Washington, D.C.; Detroit, Michigan; Los Angeles, California; Kansas City, Missouri; and numerous other cities throughout the United States are producing the same poor academic results at an extraordinary cost to the taxpayer and a tremendous academic loss to our students and country.

I believe all the money in the world would not be enough to improve schools run by incompetent public school administrators. We need proven leaders who can prepare our children to be competitive members in a free-market society.

The American public has been conned into believing that public schools need more money. Have you ever met a public school administrator who said they have enough money?

President Obama is moving in the "right" direction by reforming public schools to be held responsible to the American public in return for more money. It's very clear that most Americans want to ensure that accountability be attached to the stimulus money that is being awarded to all institutions, including public schools.

<START>Next time you hear [Unknown1|school [Q212238|officials]] or [Q82955|politicians] begging for more money, ask them how large the district's budget is and how many [Q48942|students] are enrolled in their district. Then you do the [Q395|math]. After all, it's your money they want to take.

Statement from Aaron J. Kowalski, Ph.D., President and CEO of JDRF, on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorization of the Tandem Control-IQ algorithm for use as part of a hybrid closed-loop system

NEW YORK, Dec. 13, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- "Regulatory authorization of the Tandem Control-IQ algorithm for use as part of a hybrid closed-loop system is a huge win for the type 1 diabetes (T1D) community and a critical step forward in making day-to-day life better for people living with the disease.

<START>As part of our mission to improve the lives of those affected by [Q124407|T1D], [Q6107958|JDRF] has been a leader in [Q1569064|artificial pancreas] ([Q1569064|AP]) research for more than [QUANTITY|15] years and partnered with the [Q204711|U.S. Food and Drug Administration] ([OPTIONAL:Q204711|FDA]) to establish regulatory pathways to ensure [Q1569064|AP] technology gets into the hands of people with [Q124407|T1D] as quickly as possible.

This is the [QUANTITY|second] hybrid closed-loop system on the market and the [QUANTITY|first] algorithm authorized as an interoperable automated glycemic controller, which means it could be a component of an open-protocol system. People with different devices could use the algorithm and manage their glucose levels in a way that works best for them. [Q6107958|JDRF] research grants supported the development of this algorithm, and our advocacy supported the Special Diabetes Program, which funded its clinical testing.

Until we find cures, we are continuing to support the development of new technologies and treatments to improve blood sugar management so people with [Q124407|T1D] can live healthier and more manageable lives. [Q6107958|JDRF] is also fighting to ensure people with [COREF:Q124407|this disease] have more choices and better access to the diabetes management tools that work best for them through our Coverage2Control campaign.

JDRF is the leading global organization funding type 1 diabetes (T1D) research. Our mission is to accelerate life-changing breakthroughs to cure, prevent and treat T1D and its complications. To accomplish this, JDRF has invested more than $2.2 billion in research funding since our inception. We are an organization built on a grassroots model of people connecting in their local communities, collaborating regionally for efficiency and broader fundraising impact and uniting on a national stage to pool resources, passion and energy. We collaborate with academic institutions, policymakers and corporate and industry partners to develop and deliver a pipeline of innovative therapies to people living with T1D. Our staff and volunteers throughout the United States and our six international affiliates are dedicated to advocacy, community engagement and our vision of a world without T1D.

Respite for reptiles as demand drops for skins

NEW ORLEANS (AP) - As conspicuous consumption loses some of its cachet during the recession, the swamp's most conspicuous consumers have less to fear from humans.

Instead of taking the half-million alligator eggs from marshes and swamps that they had in recent years, alligator farmers are expected to pull in 30,000 this year, with a final tally in December. And state wildlife officials expect the 2009 harvest of adult gators, which begins Aug. 26, to amount to a small fraction of last year's 35,500.

Nobody's buying, said Rapides Parish nuisance-alligator control officer Ron Guy. He's among more than 60 people around the state who get called if a gator wanders out of its bayou and into a local golf course or backyard. Their pay is the right to sell the skins.

Gators bought Louisiana farmers and hunters $71 million in 2007, modest revenue even at that peak. This year, revenue is expected to be closer to $10 million in 2009, a drop like locals say they've never seen.

"My father was in the fur and alligator business. I started buying fur and alligators when I was 13 years old," said Wayne Sagrera, 65, who has about 75,000 alligators at Vermilion Gator Farm Inc. in Abbeville. "I've seen some slowdowns. But nothing to compare to this."

People who are still buying expensive accessories have shifted away from conspicuous consumption - for instance, Jimmy Choo is selling obvious faux-crocodile as well as the real thing, fashion consultant Robert Burke said.

"There's certainly a sensitivity in the luxury market of anything that is too much luxury, and alligator would fit into that category," Burke said.

His income from hauling off nuisance alligators let Guy leave construction work six years ago, but he's back now - and running out far less often for alligators.

"Instead of going on every call as soon as it comes in, you prioritize them," Guy said. "If it's under a car in the Sonic parking lot, you've got to go."

Demand for crocodilian leather, including the large alligator and crocodile skins used for handbags and the caiman leather used for cowboy boots, dropped more than 40 percent worldwide between the first quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009, according to Choon Heong Koh, executive director of Singapore tannery Heng Long International Ltd.

Demand for small, farmed hides used for watchbands fell even more dramatically - 80 percent or more, he said in an e-mail to The Associated Press.

Luxury watches are "such a high-end item - when those people stop spending money you get real nervous," said Dave Travers, owner of Sebring Custom Tanning in Sebring, Fla.

Even John Price - whose Insta-Gator Ranch and Hatchery in Covington gets 40 percent of its income from tours, including egg-hatching tours that start in mid-August each year - has suffered. He usually raises about 1,500 alligators a year to sell their hides. Instead of collecting 1,500 eggs this year from the wild, he collected 200, largely because people want to hold eggs while they hatch.

"We have customers who have booked the right to hatch an alligator. I don't want to call them back and say, 'Sorry, we're not doing it,'" Price said.

About 30 of those 200 'gators will wind up back in the wild. As part of the program that brought alligators back from the brink of extinction, Louisiana's 59 licensed alligator farmers must return about 15 percent of those they raise to the swamps they came from.

That's about the same share that would survive non-human predators during their first four years in swamps and marshes.

Trolls 'bump shame' Duchess of Cambridge

Cruel internet trolls have 'bump shamed' the Duchess of Cambridge for her lack of pregnancy curves after her first public appearance since announcing her pregnancy.

Kate, 35, attended a reception at Buckingham Palace for World Mental Health Day on Tuesday, after taking six weeks off while she battled hyperemesis gravidarum - a severe form of morning sickness - revealing just a hint of a baby bump.

While many commenters on Kensington Palace's Instagram account complimented Kate on how well she looked, others were eager to point out her tiny stomach with one saying: 'I can't believe she's pregnant, she looks too thin.'

<START>Others even claimed that they look more pregnant than [COREF:Q10479|the [NO_COREF_ALT:Q4593319|Duchess]] does, questioning how [COREF:Q10479|she] can still look so slim.

However, [Q381160|experts] hit back at the comments saying that 'bump shaming' can cause unnecessary [Q154430|anxiety] for mothers-to-be.

[Unknown1|Lesley Gilchrist], practising [Q185196|midwife] and [Q45916492|co-founder] of [Unknown2|My Expert Midwife], said: 'Bump shaming can really damage a woman's body confidence and cause needless worry and [Q154430|anxiety] over the health of their baby.<END>

It's important to remember that the bump size is just the size of the baby's "packaging" and has no bearing on the size of their baby.'

Peggy Osborne, a midwife at The Women's Health Clinic who also teaches NHS antenatal classes added: 'There is a lot of pressure on new mothers to have the perfect bump, especially when you have had to announce it perhaps before you were ready.

'But there is no real use comparing one pregnancy to a previous one, as the embryo could implant differently or eating habits may have changed - especially with hyperemesis.'

Kate is estimated to be less than 20 weeks into her pregnancy, which was announced in August before she reached the crucial 12 week stage.

Peggy added: 'At this stage in the pregnancy the uterus is being pushed higher in to the abdomen but baby is yet to cause any real "bump," typically any additional roundness is just fluid.'

Unlike regular morning sickness, it doesn't fade away with time and can leave some women bedbound as they are unable to keep food or drink down.

It is also considered to be the second leading cause of hospitalisation during pregnancy and can lead to dehydration - dangerous to both the mother and child.

Vogue Business is the first product to emerge from the firm's "incubator" which develops new products and services for the company.

**** ARTICLE #10: 20111109 - Review of Glee, "The First Time" (None) *****
Review of Glee, "The First Time"


Last American virgins: Rachel and Blaine contemplate some, er, character research in "The First Time."

Spoilers for last night's Glee below:

Right up front, let me say that "The First Time" was the best episode, overall, of Glee season three. Before we get to the good stuff, though, we had to get through about fifteen minutes of complete contrivance. So let me gripe about those first, because I'm kind of a jerk that way.

"The First Time" is about sex and virginity, hence the name. And lest we miss that theme, it begins by morphing Artie into an overconfident, pushy director who questions Rachel and Blaine's ability to play Maria and Tony without having become Jets all the way, as it were. (Later, he decides to counsel Coach Beiste, diagnosing her problem with intimacy. Artie, it seems, is now Dr. Drew Pinsky.)

The scene screams of a forced conflict designed to drive the plot: it's as if Artie has become Will, assigning Rachel and Blaine the loss of their virginity by writing SEX on a whiteboard as their weekly project. I don't buy it: I don't buy [1] that Artie would become fixed on this idea (despite the intro about his trying to fake his way through directing by having strong opinions) [2] that Rachel and Blaine would take it to heart ("How are we, as virgins, supposed to follow that?") and [3] two faculty members, however uncomfortable with the topic for their own reasons, would step back while a school musical director urged his stars to have sex for the good of the performance.

The thing is, you don't need a contrived reason to make an episode of Glee about sex and sexual pressure. Here's a perfectly good reason: the show takes place in a high school. Sex as a topic is kind of a given. And once we got past that setup - and that unfortunate Warblers Billy Joel video - this was a really fine episode with some genuine, believable character moments.

Lots of them too, and yet probably the best thing I can say for "First Time" is that it serviced a good half-dozen storylines but did not feel at all crowded. (Though her story got third billing, Dot Jones continued stunning work as Coach Beiste, one of Glee's few characters who can be over-the-top funny and moving at the same time, rather than in alternation.) Kurt and Rachel's respective virginity stories, for instance, were rooted in very real, existing relationship dynamics that needed no dues-ex-Artie to prod them.

In Kurt's case, it was about his wanting to assert his identity as an out gay teen, but also his autonomy to be the kind of gay teen he wants to be: in his case, a sweet, even corny romantic-which itself is a rebellion against highly sexualized teen culture in general (manifest in many things, Glee among them) and against a specific sexualized subculture within the gay community (here represented by seeming Gossip-Girl outtake Sebastian, and the saddest gay bar in Ohio).

This, not any "Will they do it?" debate, was was made his storyline for me: in its own way, his fight with Blaine in the parking lot was as much a statement as his coming out itself. It's his way of asserting that to him, being gay is not simply defined by sex, it's defined by love. And his tete-a-tete with newly-minted bear Karofsky, a nice epilogue to that storyline from last season, built on that: it underscored the point that being gay does not in itself settle your identity, it's simply one more step in figuring out what your identity is ultimately going to be, where you fit in.

<START>[Q1990104|Rachel] and [Q2163539|Finn]'s will-they-won't-they, meanwhile, hung on [Q1990104|Rachel]'s [Q3152967|insecurity] as a [Q713200|performer] - it is a [Q1990104|Rachel] story, after all - but also on their often-unspoken realization that there are forces that may push them apart after graduation. This got brought to a head for [Q2163539|Finn] in [COREF:Q2163539|his] disappointment with the [Q7080909|Ohio State] [Q2072298|recruiter]; hearing that [COREF:Q2163539|he]'s reached [COREF:Q2163539|his] "ceiling" was a harsh and very real moment, and [Q296484|Cory Monteith] really sold [Q2163539|Finn]'s feeling of being helpless and overmatched, unable to keep up with [Q1990104|Rachel] as [COREF:Q1990104|she] moves on to bigger things. [COREF:Unknown1|I]'m not sure how romantic it is to see them end up in bed essentially as pity sex ([COREF:Unknown1|I] half-expected [Q1990104|Rachel] to say, "Now [COREF:Q1990104|I]'m doing this for the right reason: Because [COREF:Q1990104|I] feel sorry for [COREF:Q2163539|you]"). But it rooted the decision in their larger story: it's one way they can be together that's still in their control.

Oh, yeah: [COREF:Unknown1|I] guess [COREF:Unknown1|I] should say something about the whole plot-about-teens-having-sex business. Um, it's high school? [COREF:Unknown1|I] know some people hold stories set in school to a different standard, but [COREF:Unknown1|I] have a hard time with the idea that a TV show should (or can) try to influence teenagers" sexual behavior-much less influence it toward never, ever having sex until marriage (or at least graduation).

[COREF:Q520766|The episode] said a lot of things about sex, negative and positive, but the bottom line was that it made out first-time sex to be a big deal. That seems about right.<END>

Now a quick hail of bullets:

* I hadn't thought there was much Glee could do to switch up its musical format, but I very much liked the device of using rehearsal performances of West Side songs to comment on the action. I don't know that the series can repeat the device once the musical is over, but I do hope it continues to mix things up.

* Likewise, while there was a certain TV level of production in the musical itself, it was a good move to make the effort to have it sound like an actual high school production in an auditorium, rather than a highly-produced iTunes download.

* "Poison Arrow" is easily my favorite ABC song - from back when I was a young person, before the Great War - so it was a little sad to see it now used as an auditory shorthand for "seedy Ohio nightclub." But I cannot say it was entirely inappropriate.

* I'm not sure if the musical scenes are meant to convey the sense that Santana is currently blowing everyone else in New Directions away, but that's how it looks to me.

* Will and Sue? Did not miss them one bit.

Feminists want Mila Kunis to turn down a Harvard award

A Harvard University theater group with an all-male cast is under fire from those who say it should allow women onstage - and they're asking Mila Kunis to take up their cause.

Detractors are calling on the Hasty Pudding troupe to start casting women and to update sexist portrayals of women. Amid the debate, some are calling on Kunis to reconsider her acceptance of the group's Woman of the Year award on Thursday to protest the exclusion.

'It would be a wonderful thing for her to not accept this award, to say this is gender inequality,' said Liz Kantor, a senior studying molecular and cellular biology, who auditioned for this year's show.

'There are women on campus who are more than willing to take advantage of these opportunities, yet they're still being excluded.'

Tickets to the Man of the Year roast honoring Paul Rudd cost $200 - but the price for the Woman of the Year event are just $80.

Hasty Pudding is known for bawdy comedic revues that feature men in drag playing female characters, a longstanding tradition in the group, which says it was formed in 1795.

But more recently, women have sought acting roles in the student-written parodies, which are shown in Massachusetts, New York and Bermuda and have helped launch careers for former students ranging from Jack Lemmon to Broadway composer Larry O'Keefe.

Kantor is among about 20 women who auditioned for this year's show as a form of protest, an idea started by two women in 2015. Each year, the women have promptly been cut.

Women can instead take behind-the-scenes jobs, including writing the shows or working on the technical crew, the group says on its website.

Students on Hasty Pudding's executive board, which is led by a woman and includes several female members, declined to comment. Overall, about half the 50 students involved with the group are women.

<START>[COREF:Q1588813|The troupe] has been criticized for [COREF:Q1588813|its] all-male cast before, including in a [DATETIME|2016] petition from [QUANTITY|dozens] of former members.

[COREF:Q1588813|Its] shows take cues from the [Q692|Shakespearean] era, when men played all roles. [Q13371|Harvard] [COREF:Q13371|itself] admitted only male [Q21094885|undergraduates] until a partial merger with [Q49124|Radcliffe College] in [DATETIME|1977].

The [Q5680700|Man] and [Q10294045|[Q10294045|Woman of the Year] awards] precede the kickoff of the annual revue, which includes more than [QUANTITY|30] performances in February and March.<END>

Kunis, whose credits include 'That '70s Show' and 'Black Swan,' has spoken out sharply against sexism in entertainment, including in a 2016 essay. She did not respond to a request for comment.

Some students and alumni have also said this year's Man of the Year, Paul Rudd, should stand up against the exclusion. A message seeking comment was sent to a representative for the actor.

Others recently named Woman of the Year by the group include Octavia Spencer and Amy Poehler, who cracked a biting joke about the group's exclusion of women when she accepted the honor in 2015.

'You know it's time for a change when the Augusta National Golf Club has lapped you in terms of being progressive,' Poehler said, referring to the Georgia club's 2012 decision to admit women.

Some critics are also challenging the portrayal of women in the revues, which have featured characters with names like 'Donna My Knees' and 'Sheila Rowsya.'

'It just magnifies the misogyny that men are portraying these characters,' said Kantor, of West Nyack, New York. 'They're usually just the most blatant stereotypes you could think of.'

Women who have pushed for a place in the cast say students are split. Some say women in drag wouldn't be as funny, and some say the all-male cast is a tradition that should be protected.

Hasty Pudding started as a social club, taking its name from the porridge members brought to meetings. The school recognizes it as a student group but doesn't necessarily endorse its views, a school spokesman said. Officials declined to comment on its casting policies.

But the administration has been working to curb groups that exclude members based on gender, including secretive all-male groups known as 'final clubs.'

Students who join single-gender social groups, for example, are banned from campus leadership positions, but Hasty Pudding is considered an arts group, not a social group, and isn't subject to the rule.

Emily Ratajkowski shows off her washboard abs in crop tee

It may be winter in the U.S., but it's swimsuit season all year around for Emily Ratajkowski.

The 26-year-old's washboard abs were on full view as she perkily posed in a white crop T-shirt and red thong bikini bottoms on Friday.

The stunning model gave a sultry stare into the camera while posing up a storm.

The Blurred Lines vixen has understandably never been afraid of showing off her flawless figure on Instagram, and her social media offerings this week included a flirty dancing video and a Botticelli inspired snap.

Standing completely naked, she mimicked the goddess of love, beauty, sex and fertility from the Italian master's famous Birth Of Venus painting.

Like the seashell surfing deity, strategically placed hair and hands helped preserve her modesty.

In Harper's, for which she posed nude on horseback, Emily praised social media as 'a format where you can be so direct with an audience'.

She said: 'Social media is something women didn't have ten years ago, and that's a big aspect in feminism today. I don't have to be filtered by anyone. I choose.'

Exhibitionism is not Emily's only motive; the swimwear she so frequently models is from her own line.

JustGiving waived fee on Claire Squires' page but does it really need to take 8% from a £10 donation?

By Andrew Oxlade for the Daily Mail


When the huge public reaction to the death of marathon runner Claire Squires became apparent, the reaction from JustGiving, which hosted her fundraising, should have been automatic: it should waive the substantial fee that it creams off donations.

But it was only late last Tuesday morning that the "for-profit" company said the charge would not be applied - after an email from us and the start of a backlash on their own homepage blog, which was urging people to donate.

This evening, Claire's fundraising total had hit £910,000, or £1.1million including the gift aid top-up from taxpayers.

JustGiving says it charges 5 per cent but this is applied after gift aid so the £55,000 it would have made works out as more than 6 per cent of public donations. On top of this, there's a 1.3 per cent credit card charge.

Consider if you donated £10 by credit card. The amount is topped up to £12.50 because of gift aid. The 5 per cent fee is applied - 63p - then 1.3 per cent credit card charge on the £10 - 13p - taking the total to 76p.

This means fees account for 7.6 per cent of the original £10 donation

Some of the people I've spoken to this week, on social media and in person, don't realise there is a fee at all.

It's hardly surprising. There's no mention of it on the homepage and only a small reference way down at the foot of each giving page, which most donors are unlikely to see.

JustGiving pioneered this method of online giving a decade ago but now it's the supine encumbent, surpassed by far cheaper rivals, such as Virginmoneygiving.com, Bmycharity.com and Charitygiving.co.uk.

Virgin Money, which is not-for-profit, only charges 2 per cent on donations and not on gift aid, and Bmycharity.com applies no commission, just a flat charge on card payments.

They also charge the charities a lower fee than JustGiving just to register to accept donations. [Read the story on Justgiving and its cheaper rivals].

<START>It's big business for [Q6316819|JustGiving]. Consider that the [Q578794|London Marathon] raises more than £[QUANTITY|50million] a year. [Q6316819|JustGiving] will account for a large chunk of that each year - and take [QUANTITY|5] per cent.

[Q6316819|JustGiving] claims [COREF:Q6316819|its] revenues help to hone the process of giving and help [COREF:Q6316819|it] make more money for charities. [COREF:Q6316819|It] claims to have raised £[QUANTITY|770million] since [DATETIME|2000], which should mean earnings of £[QUANTITY|38.5million] for [COREF:Q6316819|the company]. [COREF:Q6316819|It] insists £[QUANTITY|14million] has been 're-invested in technology alone'.

Presumably after the staff are paid - there's [QUANTITY|72] of them - there's potential for decent profits.<END>

To be fair, innovation should be encouraged and rewarded when it contributes to the common good.

But for the sake of transparency the company should declare its cut of each donation during the actual payment process and publish its annual profits on the website. And just maybe it should take a little less.

Taylor Swift's new song disses famous ex-boyfriends

She's already lashed out at the likes of Katy Perry, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West on the first revenge-themed track from her new album.

But it appears absolutely nobody is safe from Taylor Swift's razor-sharp lyrics, as she seems to take aim at her impressive roster of famous ex-boyfriends in her new song Ready For It?

The sassy songstress uses the peppy new love anthem to lavish current boyfriend Joe Alwyn with praise, while not-so-subtly appearing to diss former lovers such as Tom Hiddleston and Calvin Harris.

Scroll down for video

Taylor, 27, has released the second track from new album, reputation, and sleuthing fans have already started decoding the lyrics to work out just who Taylor is singing about.

Her lyrics include: 'Knew he was a killer, first time that I saw him, wonder how many girls he had left haunted.'

She goes on: 'Some boys are tryin' too hard. He don't try at all though. Younger than my exes but he act like such a man so I see nothing better, I keep him forever.'

Fans immediately assumed Taylor was singing about actor boyfriend Joe, 26, who is younger than previous loves Tom, 36, and Calvin, 33, and made his movie debut as a solider in the 2016 film Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk.

The superstar then seems to allude to her past doomed romances with Tom, Calvin and the likes of Harry Styles, 23 and Jake Gyllenhaal, 26, by purring: 'Every love I've known in comparison is a failure, I forget their names now. I'm so very tame now. Never be the same now.'

Meanwhile, others have asked if Taylor is poking fun at her serial dater reputation with the lyrics: 'Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me, stealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry.'

To an ebullient tune, the chorus blares that 'In the middle of the night, in my dreams, you should see the things we do, baby. In the middle of the night, in my dreams, I know I'm gonna be with you.'

Taylor has been quietly dating Joe since last year, choosing to keep their romance away from the limelight, which means if Ready For It? was penned about Joe, it's the first time she's publicly acknowledged the relationship.

Some fans have wondered whether the song title, Ready For It?, is directed at Joe, asking if he's ready for the attention that comes with dating the pop princess.

The song was released amid claims Taylor has filed paperwork to trademark phrases and lyrics connected with her new reputation album, including the line from Look What You Made Me Do, 'The old Taylor can't come to the phone right now. Why? Because she's dead.'

<START>According to [Q2630118|TMZ], [COREF:Q26876|the award-winning [NO_COREF_ALT:Q488205|singer-songwriter]] has also trademarked song titles from [COREF:Q26876|her] [Q37814092|[Q37814092|reputation] album] so [COREF:Q26876|she] can use the lyrics and titles on official merchandise.

Meanwhile, a minute-long snippet of [Q38552445|Ready For It?] debuted during the [Q4705216|Alabama] versus [Q5461626|Florida State] [Q41323|football] game on [DATETIME|Saturday], before [Q26876|Taylor] released [COREF:Q38552445|the entire track] to [Q866|YouTube] on [DATETIME|Sunday].

In stark contrast to [Q37912621|Look What You Made Me Do], [COREF:Q38552445|the peppy new [NO_COREF_ALT:Q541947|anthem]] struck a far more upbeat note, with [Q26876|Taylor] singing of love and romance.<END>

Both Taylor and ESPN shared a clip of the track with fans on social media, which was the background music for scenes of the two football teams prepared to hit the field.

The video featured scenes of cheerleaders, fans, football players, and seemed to herald a major shift from Look What You Made Me Do.

'Are you ready for it?' Taylor sings in the pop country song. 'Baby let the games begin.'

Twitter was ablaze with fan reaction, including YouTube personality Raphael Gomes, who wrote: 'oh my good i am shooketh, #readyforit sounds like red meets 1989 meets look what you made me do, it sounds magical'.

Another fan wrote a tweet in which his response to the song snippet was a GIF of Jim Parsons' The Big Bang Theory character Sheldon hyperventilating into a paper bag.

As some eagle-eyed fans noticed, Taylor had hinted at this single on August 24, in an Instagram post promoting Look What You Made Me Do.

She'd written: '...ready for it? New single #LookWhatYouMadeMeDo out now. Pre-order #reputation (link in bio) and find out about tickets and merch at taylorswift.com'.

The whole song will be the opener on reputation, according toPeople.

Despite the fact Look What You Made Me Do proclaimed the 'old Taylor' was 'dead,' Ready For It? appears to be a return to form - a country-tinged, peppy love song.

Look What You Made Me Do, on the other hand, had been a score-settling number aimed at those 'I don't like.'

She lashed out at betrayals: 'You asked me for a place to sleep, / Locked me out, and threw a feast,' and appeared to dredge up her on-off feud with Kanye West in the line: 'I don't like your tilted stage,' Kanye having performed on tilted stages on tour.

The lyrics insisted that 'I got smarter. I got harder in the nick of time,' and that 'Honey, I rose up from the dead. I do it all the time.'

She warned: 'I've got a list of names, and yours is in red underlined.'

When that song's music video debuted at Sunday's MTV Video Music Awards, fans were treated to a smorgasbord of references to her old beefs.

At one point, she looks strikingly like Katy Perry while crashing a car and emerging from the wreck brandishing a Grammy Award.

Katy's infamously a 13-time Grammy nominee and a zero-time winner, whilst Taylor's won a grand total of 10 Grammy Awards herself.

In the most scathing dig of the video, she lounges in a bathtub full of jewelry, possibly in reference to Kim Kardashian's robbery last October in Paris.

The robbers had bound her at gunpoint and flung her into the bathtub of her suite at the Hôtel de Pourtalès, making off with millions of dollars worth of her jewelry.

At one point, whilst sitting in the bathtub in the music video, Taylor even mimes firing off a gun.

Kim had involved herself in Taylor's feud with Kanye last year, after which Taylor accused the couple of 'character assassination,' so it's interesting that the bathtub bit of the music video sees Taylor gripe about 'How you laugh when you lie.'

Old flames get a going over too, including Tom Hiddleston, who was notoriously photographed during their relationship in a tank top reading: 'I [heart] T.S.'

Taylor appears in the video with male backup dancers wearing stilettos, hose and crop tops that have got that same inscription.

By the end of the video, there's a row of Taylors - each dressed to represent a different one of her past personae - and they all begin sniping at one another.

One, for example, is the gawky Taylor of the You Belong With Me video, and another's wearing the gown she wore to the 2009 VMAs, at which Kanye had interrupted her acceptance speech to shower praise on Beyonce.

The dorky, perpetually thrilled You Belong With Me Taylor is hectored by one of the others: 'You can't possibly be that surprised all the time.'

When VMA Taylor expresses a desire 'to be excluded from this narrative' - a phrase she'd used last summer vis-à-vis the Kimye feud - all the others scream: 'SHUT UP!'

Crystal Palace midfielder Yohan Cabaye has less than half-a-year on deal

Club want to secure him as he is now free to discuss terms with other clubs

Eagles deal likely to be one-year contract with option of additional year

By Kieran Gill for MailOnline


Crystal Palace want to tie Yohan Cabaye down to a new short-term deal with less than half a year left on the midfielder's contract.

Manager Roy Hodgson has been impressed with 32-year-old Cabaye, who has made 18 starts in the Premier League this season.

Cabaye was signed in 2015 from Paris Saint-Germain for a then club-record fee of £10million that brought the midfielder back to the Premier League.

Should Cabaye decide to stay at Selhurst Park, it would likely be a one-year contract with the option of an additional year, Sportsmail understands.

Palace are in a race against time to come to an agreement. Cabaye is now free to speak to other clubs ahead of the expiration of his contract.

Since Hodgson came in, the former Newcastle man has been trusted with a creative midfield role.

The Eagles have clawed their way back from relegation trouble and lie in the safety of mid-table.

Next up for Cabaye and Co is a trip to the Emirates to take on Arsenal on Saturday.

Collingwood have ruled out high-profile recruit Daniel Wells for their round-one AFL clash with the Western Bulldogs.

The former North Melbourne midfielder has had calf muscle problems and did not play in any of the Magpies' pre-season matches.

Sidelined: Daniel Wells.

While Wells is one of the league's most talented midfielders, he was a high-risk recruit because he is 31 and has a history of leg injuries.

"Last week we said that we would reassess every seven days, and we are pleased with the way that he is progressing," football chief Geoff Walsh said.

"He is starting to get some good conditioning into his legs, but he won't make round one.

"We are all aware of that, but having said that, we are really pleased that he is going forward and he is starting to feel good, particularly in relation to his calf.

"As he gets better and as he builds training, that will tell us when he is ready to resume."

The news is better for a host of Wells' new teammates.

"Levi Greenwood will train on Friday ... he had some hamstring tightness, but we expect him to roll out on Friday," Walsh said.

<START>"It means [DATETIME|Friday] will be the biggest session of the week and we expect [COREF:Q6535420|him] to train then, as will [Q7437027|Scott Pendlebury] ([Q223172|achilles]).

Kasem's show featured long-distance dedications

The dedications flowed in from around the world

He took his role as storyteller seriously

(CNN) -- "Keep your feet on the ground, and keep reaching for the stars."

That signature sign-off of Casey Kasem's was recalled by fans of his syndicated weekend radio show "American Top 40" Sunday after the legendary disc jockey died at the age of 82. Kasem began that show in 1970 and hosted it and variations of it until finally ending his radio career in 2009.

But for more than just those encouraging words, Kasem will be remembered for helping to elevate the radio disc jockey gig to one of storyteller and observer of the human condition.

Fans would write in to his show for "long-distance dedications" -- requesting a song for a loved one, a friend or a personal connection far away. In his smooth baritone voice, Kasem would begin "Dear Casey" and proceed to tell tales that ranged from heartbreaking to inspirational.

The dedications poured in from around the world. In 1986, Kasem read a dedication request from a woman in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, who wanted to honor her sister who -- despite suffering paralysis -- was studying for her master's degree in the United States.

"I'm so proud of her, not only for her achievements, but proud of her will and toughness and of her stubborn determination to pick up the pieces and start all over again when most of us would break down and quit," Kasem read. "Casey, could you kindly play 'Broken Wings' for my sister Ayesha at Oklahoma State University? I do hope she's listening, for this is a message from those who love her, all the way from home here in Malaysia."

Kasem got personal after the death of Beatle John Lennon. The DJ offered up moving words in 1980 after Lennon was gunned down near his New York City apartment by Mark David Chapman.

"But John died having discovered who he was," Kasem said. "John Lennon, husband to Yoko, father to Sean [Lennon's young son with wife Yoko Ono]."

The role of music orator was one Kasem took very seriously.

"It's so simple: what do people love?" Kasem said to the New York Times in a 1999 article. "Plato said it best. 'People who tell the stories rule society.' And we tell the stories, and people love to hear the stories. Of course, we've got tremendous responsibility to become accurate with those stories. And in most cases to be wholesome."

On Sunday, the "AT40" website posted a tribute to Kasem. The site for the program, now hosted by Ryan Seacrest, included audio clips of Kasem on the show throughout the years.

[Q84|LONDON] ([Q130879|Reuters]) - [Q14211|British Prime Minister] [Q192|David Cameron]'s failure to win parliamentary backing for military action against [Q858|Syria] has hurt [COREF:Q192|him] politically, polls showed on [DATETIME|Monday], with most [Q842438|Britons] thinking [COREF:Q192|him] "reckless" and support for [DESC:Q9626|[COREF:Q192|his] party] falling.

A [Q5150446|Comres]/[Q220072|ITV] poll showed that [QUANTITY|59] percent of those asked thought [COREF:Q192|he] had been reckless to organize [DATETIME|last Thursday]'s vote on military action without knowing whether [COREF:|he] had [Q4175034|lawmakers]' backing.

Another poll showed the opposition [Q9630|[Q9630|Labour] party] had increased [COREF:Q9630|its] lead over [Q192|Cameron]'s ruling [Q9626|Conservatives] to [QUANTITY|10] from [QUANTITY|four] percentage points after the parliamentary defeat, setting back [COREF:Q192|his] hopes of being re-elected in [DATETIME|2015].<END>

"The ten point lead is larger than we have seen of late, suggesting at least some impact from the Syria vote," YouGov, the second poll's organizer, said on Monday.

Britain's lower house of parliament voted against Cameron's Syrian plans by 285 to 272 votes on Thursday, inflicting a shock defeat on him even though he had already made big concessions to try to win approval.

It had long been clear that most Britons opposed their country being involved in military action against Syria and did not agree with Cameron, but Monday's polls suggest they think he badly mismanaged the overall situation too.

Cameron's office has ruled out a re-run of the Syria vote despite pressure from some senior lawmakers to do so, saying that "parliament has spoken" with ministers keen to blame Labour for sabotaging the vote, an accusation Labour dismisses.

Commentators say both parties want to avoid a repeat. In Cameron's case, losing another vote on Syria could trigger a leadership challenge against him, something that a significant minority in his fractious party would welcome.

Many politicians and commentators have also expressed fears that Cameron's defeat could damage Britain's 'special relationship' with the United States given that President Barack Obama had asked for and not got British military support.

However, another poll showed most Britons did not share that fear. The survey, by the BBC, showed that 72 percent of those asked did not think UK-U.S. ties would be harmed, and two thirds of respondents would not care if they were.

Piers Morgan: JK Rowling's Trump slur proves her hypocrisy

JK Rowling hates Donald Trump.

I don't just mean she dislikes him intensely, I mean she loathes him with a raw, visceral fury.

The billionaire Harry Potter author broadcasts this fact on a daily basis to her 11 million followers on Twitter.

Barely an hour goes by without Ms Rowling publicly attacking, mocking, sneering at and generally abusing Trump.

Of course, that is entirely her prerogative and she is far from alone in this regard.

A lot of people, including many left-wing celebrities like her, feel the exact same way about the 45th President of the United States.

Politics is a passionate business. It inflames people.

And no politician in the history of Planet Earth inflames people quite as much as Donald J. Trump.

Scroll down for video

On Friday, a video was posted on Twitter by Ansel Herz, deputy communications director for Democrat Rep. Pramila Jayapal.

It showed Trump appearing to avoid shaking hands with a disabled child before leaving a White House function.

"Child in wheelchair reaches up twice to shake the president's hand," was Herz's simple but devastating caption.

"If you're disgusted by this," he added, "follow my boss: @RepJayapal. People call her "the anti-Trump." "

Disgust duly followed.

The short video clip went viral within minutes, sparking horror and rage around the world.

Keith Olbermann, infamous left-wing political commentator who now hosts a Trump-bashing GQ webshow "The Resistance," led the charge, re-tweeting Herz's video clip with the words: "About Trump, this is mortifying, revelatory. OTOH, I'm somebody who shook his damnable hand. The child is fortunate he didn't touch the evil."

For JK Rowling, this was the moment she had long been waiting for.

Here, right before our very eyes, was actual visible proof that Trump really is a barbaric, callous monster as she keeps saying.

She hit her laptop faster than Usain Bolt hits his stride.

First, Rowling retweeted Herz's tweet alongside a quote she had located from legendary civil rights activist Maya Angelou that read: "When someone shows you who they are, believe them."

In other words, THIS was the real Donald Trump: a merciless man who would deliberately ignore a young disabled child reaching up to shake his hand.

Seconds later, she tweeted again: "Trump imitated a disabled reporter. Now he pretends not to see a child in a wheelchair, as though frightened he may catch his condition."

Wow.

No room for ambiguity there.

Rowling was very clear: Trump knew the disabled child was there and snubbed him because he was worried about being infected with whatever disease the boy may have.

Tweets No3 and No4 came together, fast and furious: "This monster of narcissism values only himself and his pale reflections. The disabled, minorities, transgender people, the poor, women... (unless related to him by ties of blood, and therefore his creations) are treated with contempt, because they do not resemble Trump."

Then, in tweet No5, Rowling got personal, invoking the spirit of her mother who died in 1990.

"My mother used a wheelchair. I witnessed people uncomfortable around her disability, but if they had a shred of decency they got over it."

Tweet No6 explained this was why Rowling felt SO enraged: "So, yes, that clip of Trump looking deliberately over a disabled child's head, ignoring his outstretched hand, has touched me on the raw."

Again, she left no room for any doubt. Trump hadn't accidentally snubbed the boy, he had done it "deliberately."

Tweet No7 clarified why this was so vile: "That man occupies the most powerful office in the free world and his daily outrages against civilised norms are having a corrosive effect."

And then, in Tweet No8, JK Rowling reached peak anger: "How stunning," she wrote, "and how horrible, that Trump cannot bring himself to shake the hand of a small boy who only wanted to touch the President."

By this stage, it would be hard not to share Rowling's uncontrollable rage - right? I suspect most of her 11.4 million Twitter followers would certainly have felt that way.

They trust Rowling.

As she never ceases to remind us from her high moral plinth, she is the very beacon of honesty, decency and fairness in a world increasingly blighted by Trump-related lies, indecency and unfairness.

She, like Rep. Jayapal, is the "anti-Trump."

She is someone who would never snub a disabled boy.

There's just one problem: it was all a lie.

Trump didn't snub the boy. In fact he did the complete opposite.

The full video of this incident emerged several hours after Rowling tweeted.

It shows Trump heading directly to the boy the moment he entered the room.

He greets him before he greets anyone else.

Then the President crouches down, touches the boy and talks just to him for a few more seconds before moving on.

It turns out that Trump spent more time with the boy in the wheelchair than any other guest - displaying all the compassion and empathy he had been accused of failing to display.

By the time this longer video appeared, the original edited clip was everywhere, gleefully fuelled by high profile liberals.

Chelsea Clinton, who has 1.8 million followers, seized on Rowling's tweets, re-tweeting both the Maya Angelou quote and clip, and the one about how "stunning and horrible" it was that Trump snubbed the boy.

As Sir Winston Churchill once said: "A lie gets halfway round the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on."

Ansel Herz, once he saw the full video, immediately removed his tweets.

"Deleted because it turned out to missing some context," he said. "Apologies."

<START>Missing some context? [COREF:Unknown1|You] can say that again, buddy.

Let's be very clear: [COREF:Unknown1|you] made the whole world think [Q22686|Trump] hates disabled kids.

Now, at this point, some [QUANTITY|five] hours after [COREF:Q34660|her] vicious tweet-storm, [Q34660|JK Rowling] started to be bombarded with demands to delete [COREF:Q34660|her] own tweets and apologise. [COREF:Unknown2|I] tweeted [COREF:Q34660|her] [COREF:Unknown2|myself] to say: "What's stunning and horrible is how [COREF:Q34660|you] lied to viciously smear [Q22686|Trump]. Delete these lies."<END>

She didn't respond, to anybody.

The world's most aggressively self-righteous tweeter went unusually silent.

A whole day went by.

Then another.

Finally, more than 48 hours later, Rowling came back on Twitter yesterday.

But not, it transpired, to delete the tweets that she now knew were 100% wrong.

No, instead she wished to rant about some deeply offensive comments made by an Irish newspaper columnist.

"This filth was published in the Sunday Times," she seethed. "Let that sink in for a moment."

I didn't have much time to let it sink in before the newspaper concerned deleted the column, profusely apologised and fired the journalist who wrote it.

Yet, incredibly, indignant Rowling saw no inconsistency in allowing her own deeply offensive tweets about Trump and the disabled boy to remain on her feed.

Even the boy's mother pleaded with her to remove the tweets.

"Ummm," said Marjorie Kelly Weer in a Facebook post, "if someone can please get a message to JK Rowling. Trump didn't snub my son & Monty wasn't even trying to shake his hand (1. He's 3 and hand shaking is not his thing. 2. He was showing off his newly acquired secret service patch). Thanks."

But this too fell on deaf, or stubborn ears.

Last December, in yet another rant about Trump, JK Rowling made her feelings crystal clear about people who don't apologise for getting things wrong.

She did so by tweeting this quote from the 17th century French writer Francois de la Rochefoucauld: "No people are more frequently wrong than those who will not admit they are wrong."

It has now been three days since JK Rowling posted a pack of lies about Donald Trump to her 11 million followers.

She knows it was wrong. We all know it was wrong.

Yet, as I write, she still refuses to delete the tweets, correct her lies, or apologise.

Even if she does so now, perhaps after reading this column, the damage has been done.

By contrast, everyone else I have mentioned did remove their tweets once they realised the truth.

Herz deleted, Olbermann deleted and Chelsea Clinton, when I brought it to her attention yesterday, also deleted.

Rowling, however, would prefer to continue using a three-year-old disabled boy to falsely smear Donald Trump, such is her blind hatred for the man.

By doing so, she is telling her millions of young impressionable Potter fans that it's absolutely fine to lie and never correct or apologise for a lie - after spending the past two years telling them that Trump is disgusting because he lies and never corrects or apologises for his lies.

This makes her a shameful, disgraceful hypocrite.

Nobody should believe a word this self-appointed High Priestess of Honesty ever says again, about anything.

The Center for Radiation Therapy of Beverly Hills Earns ACR-ASTRO Accreditation

BEVERLY HILLS, Calif., March 2, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- The Center for Radiation Therapy of Beverly Hills, a state-of-the-art cancer treatment center serving cancer patients in the Los Angeles area, has been awarded a three-year term of accreditation in radiation oncology as the result of a recent review by the American College of Radiology (ACR) and The American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO).

Radiation oncology (radiation therapy) is the careful use of high-energy radiation to treat cancer. A radiation oncologist may use radiation to cure cancer or to relieve a cancer patient's pain.

The ACR-ASTRO seal of accreditation represents the highest level of quality and patient safety. It is awarded only to facilities meeting specific practice guidelines and technical standards developed by ACR and ASTRO after a peer-review evaluation by board-certified radiation oncologists and medical physicists who are experts in the field.

Patient care and treatment, patient safety, personnel qualifications, adequacy of facility equipment, quality control procedures, and quality assurance programs are assessed in the review process. The findings are reported to the ACR-ASTRO Committee on Radiation Oncology Accreditation, which subsequently provides the practice with a comprehensive report it can use for continuous practice improvement.

The Center for Radiation Therapy of Beverly Hills, part of the Tower Hematology Oncology Medical Group, voluntarily underwent the rigorous review process to ensure the practice meets nationally accepted standards of care as determined by ACR. It is the first free-standing radiation center in California, and only the second radiation facility of any kind in the Los Angeles area, to earn the accreditation.

"We are honored to receive this prestigious accreditation, which acknowledges that the center's medical personnel are well qualified, through education and certification, to administer radiation therapy treatments," said Christopher M. Rose, M.D., Medical Director of The Center for Radiation Therapy of Beverly Hills and Chief Technology Officer of Valley Radiotherapy Associates. "We look forward to continuing to offer patients the most effective and up-to-date treatment options, and providing care that meets the highest quality standards."

Barry Rosenbloom, M.D., Managing Partner of the Tower Hematology Oncology Medical Group, said the accreditation reflects the entire group's commitment to safety and unsurpassed patient care.

"Earning the ACR-ASTRO accreditation ensures our patients that they will receive appropriate treatment from skilled medical professionals using superbly maintained equipment, in a facility that meets the most demanding professional benchmarks for safety and quality assurance," Dr. Rosenbloom asserted.

The ACR is a national professional organization serving more than 34,000 diagnostic and interventional radiologists, radiation oncologists, nuclear medicine physicians, and medical physicists, with programs focusing on the practice of medical imaging and radiation oncology and the delivery of comprehensive health care services. ASTRO is a professional organization serving more than 10,000 radiation oncologists, medical physicists, and other health care professionals involved in the treatment of cancer patients.

Hasbro's $120 robo-dog teaches kids to code

It's the pet every parent dreams of - a dog that doesn't make a mess and teaches kids a life skill.

Hasbro has unveiled a robotic dog called Proto Max that educates kids on the basics of coding by letting them program its personality.

There are also 10 activation points on the robo-dog's body, which kids assign reactions to and the app is equip with a remote control so users can drive it around.


Hasbro unveiled a $120 coding toy for children ages six and older.

Called Proto Max, kids use an app to customize its personality.

It comes in eight pieces out of the box and is programmed with 400 sounds and 100 eye animations.

There are three personalities to choose from - small, medium and big - and these options determine the dog's 'general temperament'.

The 10 different activation points trigger different behaviors that users can customize, the points include the ears, nose, tail and two sensors in the patch of fur on its back.

The robot dog was unveiled at the New York Toy Fair this weekend and is part of the FurReal Friends line, reports Cherlynn Low with Engadget.

Hasbro is offering the coding toy for $120, which is geared towards children ages six and older.

<START>[Unknown1|Proto Max] is specifically designed to teach your youngster how to code and comes with a downloadable free app for both [Q48493|iOS] and [Q94|Android].

And there is a dial on the side of its face that lets kids adjust the pitch of Proto Max's voice and how it reacts to stimuli.

The 10 different activation points trigger different behaviors that users can customize, the points include the ears, nose, tail and two sensors in the patch of fur on its back.

Kids can set the robot to respond to interactions by 'dragging and dropping reactions to slots on an in-app diagram of the robot,' reports Engadget.

Proto Max's housing is mostly transparent, as it allows kids to see the inner workings of the robot.

Its eyes consist of 2.6-inch LCD screens and speakers are placed around the machine.

And kids can play fun games with Max such as feeding the robot and playing fetch.

G4S contract to run sexual assault referral centres damned

G4S, the controversial private security company, is to run services providing medical examinations and counselling for victims of rape and sexual assault in the West Midlands.

The company has been awarded a three-year contract to take over two sexual assault referral centres (Sarcs) in Birmingham and Walsall. The national network of 33 centres across England which have developed over the past decade also allow rape and sexual assault victims to report attacks without going to the police first.

The decision to award the contract for such sensitive services to the company, despite widespread criticism over its failings in the Olympics security contract, was made by local NHS commissioners who have recently taken over responsibility for the network of Sarcs from the police.

Union leaders and violence against women campaigners sharply criticised the "sell-off" of such sensitive services to a private company with such a chequered record.

<START>[Unknown1|Karen Jennings], [Q3547264|Unison]'s [Unknown2|assistant [Q6501749|general secretary]], said: "It is shocking that a private, profit-making company with such a chequered record should be put in charge of these highly sensitive and intimate support services. A woman at her most vulnerable must be treated with the ultimate respect, dignity and sensitivity by trained [Q1391344|professionals] who she feels confident about placing her trust in," [COREF:Unknown1|she] said.

"The police service has developed over the years experience and expertise in working with women at such difficult times. They have well-established links with supportive services and agencies and that progress should not be undermined by selling these services off."

[Q7293878|[Q7293878|Rape Crisis] (England and Wales)] said victims of sexual violence need to access long-term support and counselling as well as immediate medical and legal help: "[COREF:Q7293878|Our] concern is that commissioning generic private contractors such as [Q1322045|G4S] to run Sarcs will lead to a focus on cost-efficiency above the needs of sexual violence victims and, in particular, that crucial long-term support services will be sacrificed in the name of cost-cutting."<END>

The decision to give G4S the contract appears to follow complaints that the existing centre in the West Midlands had failed to meet official minimum standards for at least four years.

G4S Forensic and Medical Services is already involved in providing similar services in Essex, Worcester and Telford. Women "crisis workers" staff the centres, assist with medical assessment and provide advice on follow-up services. G4S also provides women-only call handlers for dedicated phone lines for victims who contact Sarcs in Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire, Wiltshire and Hertfordshire. It also provides a specialist service for child victims of sexual abuse in Devon.

The company has recently advertised for "female crisis workers" to work at Sarcs at £12.50 an hour and to be on call on a 24/7 rota.

In response to the criticism, Gary Green, managing director of G4S Forensic and Medical Services, said it has been working in this area since 2005 and had developed substantial expertise in providing a high standard of care while helping the police protect the evidence they need to secure a conviction: "Our dedicated medical staff come from a range of backgrounds in health and social care and are absolutely committed to looking after the needs of the victim at what can be a very traumatic time. That's why we work with the local health services and the police to ensure that in the centres we manage, we have specially trained advocates focused solely on the welfare of those who come forward to report rape or sexual assault."

At the launch of the West Midlands G4S contracts earlier this week, Chief Superintendent Simon Hyde, the West Midlands police's head of public protection, said: "Research and evidence stresses how important it is for victims to be able to access skilled, experienced forensic medical practitioners as part of the service, and that a high ratio of these physicians should be female.

"We wanted to bring the focus back on the service we provide to victims and have ensured that we have consulted with our partners and voluntary agencies to ensure the facilities provided through the NHS give the highest standards of victim care and treatment."

Did Your Favorite Flicks Make the 2018 National Film Registry List?

The 2018 inductees into the National Film Registry represent microcosms of American history and not necessarily the best films in cinematic history. Each year the Library of Congress adds 25 more films that must be at least 10 years old, in order to "safeguard" American-made films.

National Public Radio reported Wednesday that the announced selections should mirror American culture as "compositions of consequence."

Diverse genres, length and style of film comprise the 25 the Library of Congress selected, such as Jurassic Park (1993), Disney's 1950 classic Cinderella, Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain (2005), the Rex Harrison-Audrey Hepburn musical My Fair Lady (1964), Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca (1940), Field of Dreams (1989), the Generation X favorite The Goonies (1985) and The Shining (1980), the Stanley Kubrick horror flick starring Jack Nicholson.

Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden said: "These cinematic treasures must be protected because they document our history, culture, hopes and dreams."

Selection criteria for the registry focus on "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant" films. Historically, the National Film Registry includes American company-produced films, "typically for theatrical release or recognized as a film through film festivals or film awards," reads the Library of Congress website. The purpose is to "safeguard" U.S. films.

The registry originated in 1989, when some of the first films chosen included undeniably classic The Wizard of Oz (1939), Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958), Singing in the Rain (1952), On the Waterfront with Marlon Brando (1954), Star Wars (1977) and a slew of Academy Award winning movies.

The new crop boasts a broader selection, including a short film, Hair Piece: A Film for Nappy Headed People (1984) and Smoke Signals (1998), the first-ever Native American-written, directed, co-produced and acted movie.

In a democratic show of hands, the Library of Congress gleans ongoing nominations from the public. To glimpse a list of suggested movies - listed by year - that you may want to nominate for next year's list, the library posts an online nomination form.

"Please do vote," reads the page. "Films that receive the most support each year are given special consideration during the process by members of the National Film Preservation Board."

That means that films released in 2009 are now eligible for consideration, ranging back to 1890. If you have a special fondness for Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel, Angels and Demons, Fantastic Mr. Fox, Julie and Julia, The Hangover, Monsters vs. Aliens or any preceding year's film, now is your chance to vote - up to 50 times per year.

Inside the lavish lifestyle of lotto winner scammer Baron

From slugging packages to people's doorsteps to cruising in a $200,000 BMW convertible, 'lotto rat' Gary Baron appears to have had no problem adjusting a life of luxury after winning a $16.6 million group Powerball.

While his colleagues and lotto syndicate members kept their day jobs, the 50-year-old former Victorian Toll courier splashed his newfound cash on a $600,000 home for himself and two more houses for his children, according to The Courier Mail.

He then went on to purchase the extravagant BMW convertible and a car for his kids, while entertaining the idea of a jet ski and new phones.

Mr Baron won $16.6 million in a $50 million Powerball in 2014, but claimed he had purchased the winning ticket with his own money - not funds from a workplace lotto syndicate at Toll's North Geelong depot he managed.

14 of Mr Baron's co-workers and syndicate members sued him for their share of the money, claiming he used their funds to buy the ticket before taking off with the cash and not telling them.

A settlement was reached on Wednesday between Mr Baron and the group, but it is unknown how much they will each be paid out.

The 50-year-old reportedly called in sick to work before resigning.

In the days following, Tattersalls revealed in a press release a Victorian man - reportedly Mr Baron - had won $16.6 million.

'I'm still in disbelief ... I don't need that amount of money, it's too much for me,' the man told officials.

'I'm going to share the prize money with my family. I'll make sure it doesn't change who I am but I'll definitely be able to live a better lifestyle, with a few more toys.

'I love being out on the water so I'll buy myself a boat and a jet ski, and my kids have been wanting the new iPhone 6 so they can have that now and I might spoil them each with a new car,' the anonymous man said.

Mr Baron was in charge of collecting $20 from each syndicate member to purchase lottery tickets on behalf of the group, according to a writ filed last year.

There was an understanding any winnings would be split equally between all members.

Members of the Syndicate, who said they were friends with Baron, told A Current Affair they questioned him about his recent lavish purchases.

'I said "you haven't pulled off the Powerball and haven't told us or anything have ya?" and he just goes "nah, nah" and he just laughed and walked away,' one of men in the syndicate said.

'Winning Tatts lotto is like, everybody dreams of it, that it only happened to the lucky few once in a while, this was our shot, and it's gone - he took it away from us.'

The 14 syndicate members only learned the truth about Baron's newfound wealth after one of his Toll colleagues delivered him a congratulatory bottle of champagne from Tattslotto.

<START>The civil trial ended on [DATETIME|the same day] it began in the [Q4109092|Victorian Supreme Court] on [DATETIME|Wednesday]. It was expected to carry on for [QUANTITY|five] days.

'Things have changed a bit,' [Q16729644|[Q56060731|[Q16533|Justice]] [Q16729644|Kim Hargrave]] said after [Q17131110|counsel] for the group suing [Unknown1|Mr Baron] advised [COREF:Q4109092|the court] the case had been resolved.

It is understood each of the members wanted around $[QUANTITY|1 million] in a pay-out but may get less than a quarter of that, according to [Q4656226|A Current Affair].

Media celebrates Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's life, legacy

Across television and streaming services, the life and legacy of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was already front and center Saturday, a day after her death at 87. A look at coverage and plans in her honor:

Looking back on the film that spotlighted Ginsburg worldwide, and offered intimate insight for young people, one of the CNN executives who shepherded the 2018 release pointed to the justice's cultural relevance.

"We greenlit the film because of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's extraordinary legacy in equal rights and her stature within our national culture," Amy Entelis, executive vice president for talent and content development for CNN Worldwide, told The Associated Press in an email Saturday.

<START>"We never expected [COREF:Q42048168|the film] to generate the reaction that [COREF:Q42048168|it] did. Many people were unfamiliar with [COREF:Q11116|her] pre-judicial career as a [Q40348|lawyer] for the [Q21637|ACLU] and how [COREF:Q11116|she] played such an essential role in securing equal rights, particularly for women, which meant all [Q846570|Americans] benefited," [COREF:Q58416693|she] wrote. "The stories of [COREF:Q11116|her] personal struggle to become an [Q40348|attorney] makes [COREF:Q11116|her] singular contributions to the law that much more poignant. And [COREF:Q11116|her] enduring marriage to [Q6775247|Martin Ginsburg] touched and moved audiences of all genders and generations."

Time magazine will feature Ginsburg on one of multiple special covers for an October double issue presenting the 2020 Time 100 list of the world's most influential people. It will include a special tribute to the justice, who was featured on the list in 2015.

The issues will be available on newsstands in the U.S. beginning Sept. 25.

The 2018 bio-drama focusing on Ginsburg's law school years and early legal career is available for purchase on Amazon Prime Video and in the iTunes store.

Felicity Jones, who portrayed the young law student and fighter for justice, told the AP in an email Saturday that Ginsburg was a beacon.

"Ruth Bader Ginsburg gave us hope, a public figure who stood for integrity and justice - a responsibility she did not wear lightly," she wrote. "She will be missed not only as a beacon of light in these difficult times but for her razor sharp wit and extraordinary humanity. She taught us all so much. I will miss her deeply."

Other distribution plans for the movie were pending Saturday.

Tributes and re-broadcasts are trending on streaming services and the apps of major networks, with more to come.

Plans for "CBS Sunday Morning," beginning at 9 a.m. Eastern, include journalist Erin Moriarty looking back on the life and times of the judge. Rita Braver, who covered Ginsburg, will offer an appreciation. John Dickerson of "60 Minutes" will report on the political implications of her death and "60 Minutes" correspondent Bill Whitaker will have a tribute at the end of the Sunday night broadcast.

At NBC, the news division and those of its other networks are already out with special reports. On MSNBC, a past profile, "Justice Ginsburg," was re-broadcast as word of her death spread, with plans to show it again Saturday night. The NBC streaming service Peacock has available a 2020 National Constitution Center even t honoring Ginbsurg.

Throughout Saturday, Fox News shows "FOX & Friends," "CAVUTO Live" and "America's News HQ" will discuss the legacy and historic career of Ginsburg. Joining the live coverage will be Chris Scalia, a son of Ginsburg's close friend and colleague, late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.

Charlie Sheen hints he knows Hollywood stars with HIV

He publicly announced that he was living with HIV in November 2015.

And Charlie Sheen now claims that there are people in Hollywood who are secretly living with the same disease.

'I know who they are, but I will take that to my grave,' the 51-year-old actor told The Kyle & Jackie 'O' Show on Wednesday.

The former Two & A Half Men star's comment comes after host Jackie 'O' Henderson asked: 'Do you think there are more people in Hollywood that have HIV that wouldn't dare come out and say it like you did?'

Meanwhile, the actor also claims the 'miracle drug' used to treat the virus actually makes him 'safer' than most people when it comes to sex.

'Here's the absolute freaking irony - with the miracle drug that I'm on, this PRO-140, I am actually safer than most cats out there that profess to be on the tallest tree,' he said earlier in the interview.

'I will take that to my grave': The 51-year-old actor made the claims during an interview with The Kyle & Jackie 'O' Show on Wednesday

The Anger Management actor exclusively opened up to Daily Mail Online in December about the clinical trial drug used in his treatment.

Charlie has been involved in a clinical trial for the drug called PRO-140 since early 2016.

As opposed to traditional antiretroviral therapy (ART), which involves taking daily medication, Charlie receives a weekly injection that has no side effects.

<START>In [DATETIME|December], [COREF:Q103939|he] received the news from the head of [COREF:Q103939|his] clinical trial that [COREF:Q103939|he] has achieved complete suppression of [COREF:Q15787|the virus] using this method alone.

Since breaking the news of [COREF:Q103939|his] diagnosis to the world, [COREF:Q103939|the outspoken star] has been forthcoming about the topic in public.

'... Here's the joke these days right, a friend of mine says 'hey man how's your sex life?' and I'm like 'oh it's just f---ing perfect because HIV is such a great pickup line!" he told the show's hosts.

There's nothing better than a pamper day at home to get you ready for the week ahead.

Thanks to Asda's new Sacred Spa range (from £3, Asda stores), DIY indulgence has never been better value.

The collection includes Epsom salts, body lotion, salt scrubs, body polish and body butters, all in a choice of two scents - Invigorating Sea Minerals or Jojoba and White Jasmine.

They are beautifully presented in colourful packaging, which looks far more expensive than it actually is.


It's a new year - which means there's a new colour to wear. Pantone has declared Ultra Violet the shade of 2018, so expect to see it on make-up counters in everything from eyeliner to lipstick.

<START>If that feels a step too far, try a [Q428124|violet] [Q36864|nail] polish.

So it's nice to hear she loves a multi-tasking bargain just as much as the rest of us. Her must-have travel product is a bottle of Tea Tree Oil.

A natural antiseptic, it can be used to heal blemishes, inhaled with steam to treat a cold and even as a hand sanitiser. Try Thursday Plantation Tea Tree Oil (£9.99, Boots).


It's always tempting to relax in a long, hot bath - especially on a day like today. But it is not such good news for your complexion. Hot water strips the natural oils and moisture from your skin, leaving it parched, dry and even scaly. This can also lead to more wrinkles, as drier skin tends to crease more readily.

Try to resist using water that is too hot, and limit baths or showers to 15 minutes tops. Most importantly, make sure you add a moisturising product to the water.

Bramley Bubble Bath (£12, bramley products.co.uk) contains geranium and lavender, with sweet orange essential oils. It's gentle and gets to work hydrating the skin while you relax.


If you feel like your complexion needs extra help to counteract overindulgence and revive dull skin (who doesn't at this time of year) Chanel's new palette is your secret weapon.

The Palette Essentielle (£52, chanel.com) contains a blush, a concealer and a highlighter in natural, complementary colours to hide blemishes and give cheeks a glow.


In your 50s: Perfect for brightening under the eyes, Rimmel Wake Me Up Concealer (£6.49, Boots) can also be used on pigmentation. Pat over your foundation with the applicator and blend with your finger.

In your 60s: MUA Cover and Conceal Wand (£1.50, Superdrug) should be used before applying foundation for long-lasting coverage. It works particularly well on thread veins or dark under-eye shadows.

In your 70s: Available in 12 shades, NYX Studio Photogenic Wand Concealer (£6, Debenhams) works for most skin tones. It brightens and camouflages and even comes in a green shade to neutralise redness.


January is when our immune systems most need a boost to ward off coughs and colds.

Echinacea has been shown to aid the body's defence against germs and now - thanks to Fresh cosmetics - the immune boosting plant extract can benefit our skin, too.

The Fresh Creme Ancienne Ultimate Nourishing Honey Mask (£116 John Lewis) uses echinacea to detoxify, and pure honey to help seal in moisture, soften skin and improve elasticity.

Apply to dampened face, leave on for 10 minutes, then rinse as normal. It feels very rich, but not sticky. A pricey, but worth it, New Year treat.

Woman claims Kate Duchess of Cambridge revealed unborn baby is a girl

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have announced they are expecting their first baby.

SHE'S usually so good at keeping secrets. But the famously discreet Duchess of Cambridge may have dropped her guard a little on a walkabout.

According to one member of the crowd, Kate, who is five months pregnant, appeared to hint she might be having a baby girl.

Sandra Cook 67, was among the 2,000 wellwishers who greeted the Duchess on her visit to Grimsby.

"The lady next to me gave her a teddy bear and I distinctly heard her say 'Thank you, I will take that for my d....'," she told the Daily Mail.

"Then she stopped herself. I leant over and said to her: 'You were going to say daughter, weren't you?' She said: "No, we don't know!" I said: 'Oh, I think you do' to which she replied: "We're not telling!"

"I have been here since 10am and it was worth every cold minute of the wait to see her. She is just beautiful and so lovely and friendly."

Diana Burton, 41, who gave Kate the teddy, was too shell-shocked to recall the conversation.But Mrs Cook, who works in a local charity shop and lives in Grimsby, was adamant about what she heard.

"I only hope that she doesn't now give birth to a boy or I'm going to look pretty stupid," she said.

"But she definitely said 'd------'."

St James's Palace did not comment on the matter, although royal sources insisted the couple had not yet found out the sex of the baby, which is due in July.

There was more baby talk and plenty of gifts for Kate as she went on a ten-minute walkabout outside the National Fishing Heritage Centre.

One admirer, Bobbie Brown, 42, asked Kate whether she had felt the baby kicking yet.

"She said: 'Yes it is, very much so'," she said.

<START>Although [COREF:Q179406|it] is still one of the largest centres for [Q152|fish] processing in [Q145|Britain], [Q179406|Grimsby] has been in decline since [DATETIME|the 1950s] and youth unemployment is among the highest in [COREF:Q145|the country].

Unfortunately [COREF:Q10479|the [NO_COREF_ALT:Q4593319|Duchess]]'s arrival was almost [QUANTITY|90] minutes late after [COREF:Q10479|her] helicopter was delayed by thick fog.

Royal [Q483501|artist] [Q2947141|Paul Emsley] explains the new [Q134307|portrait] of [Q10479|The Duchess of Cambridge]<END>

She had been due to be collected from Kensington Palace by the Queen's helicopter, known as the Royal Fight, at 10am in time for a 11.35am start. The flight is paid for by taxpayers and will cost around £3,500.

But dignitaries and flag-waving wellwishers were left shivering in the cold as her pilot waited for a break in the weather.

Many grumbled that the foggy conditions had been known about well in advance and asked why Kate had not simply taken the train, a three-and-a-half hour journey which costs £42.50 each way.

A St James's Palace spokesman said: "A number of factors are taken into consideration when deciding on transport, including cost, practicality and security arrangements and what the member of the Royal Family is doing before and after the engagement."

At a later visit to the Humberside Fire and Rescue Service, Claire Moss-Smith, 86, a patient at a local hospice told the Duchess: "I'm waiting for you to be Queen."

Kate replied with a smile: "You might be waiting for a long time."

Bill Shorten and the chamber of petulance

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten in Parliament on Wednesday.

Photo: Alex Ellinghausen

If puerile nastiness entertains you, or watching adults behave like petulant adolescents, then Federal Parliament was the show to watch this week. Anyone who witnessed question time, especially from inside the chamber, would have seen small-mindedness triumphant. If Australia is suffering from a failure of political leadership, causing a loss of business confidence and investment, then that failure is clearly bi-partisan.

With a precipitous decline in revenue as the price of all our major energy exports have plunged, and the Senate serving as a chamber where budget cuts go to die, Australia has a real challenge in finding new sources of revenue and new ways of curbing spending. The government has made efforts, and most of them have been rebuffed in the Senate and rejected by the public. New measures are needed. The time for posturing is over.

If Australia is suffering from a failure of political leadership, causing a loss of business confidence and investment, then that failure is clearly bi-partisan.

Yet this is what the alternate leader of the nation, Bill Shorten had to offer on the first day of Parliament in 2015:

Question one: "Given that nearly half of his parliamentary colleagues, including two-thirds of his Liberal backbenchers, have today expressed a lack of confidence in the Prime Minister, how can the Prime Minister claim to have a mandate from this country?"

Advertisement

Two: "Is the Prime Minister planning to abandon any of his budget measures? Or is he just planning to abandon his Treasurer, as he did at the press conference today?"

Three: "I refer to the Liberal member for Brisbane's perceptive comments yesterday: We cannot govern ourselves in an internal climate of fear and intimidation. And that is the unacceptable situation we have endured for the past five years. Does the Prime Minister agree with the member for Brisbane?"

Four: "My question is to the Minister for Communications [Malcolm Turnbull]. Minister, why are you still on the front bench?"

The answers were (question one) no; (question two) yes; (question three) no; (question four) because I'm not a treacherous back-stabber who helped bring down both leaders I have served under.

<START>[Q4910865|[Q177053|Mr] [Q4910865|Shorten]] then moved a no-confidence motion in [COREF:Q348577|the [NO_COREF_ALT:Q14212|Prime Minister]], yet devoted much of [COREF:Q4910865|his] energy to a gratuitous personal attack on [Q927550|Turnbull]: "[COREF:Q927550|He], the [Q226822|Zorro] of the dispatch box, has said that [COREF:Q927550|he] wants [COREF:Q319145|the job] but [COREF:Q927550|he] will not fight for [COREF:Q319145|the job]. [COREF:Q927550|He] is prepared to injure [DESC:Q348577|[COREF:Q927550|his] [Q319145|Prime Minister]] but [COREF:Q927550|he] leaves [COREF:Q927550|his] supporters hanging. [COREF:Q927550|He] is a veritable ball of ambivalence!"

And so on. [Q4910865|Shorten] will not be remembered for [COREF:Q4910865|his] wit.

This week was an opportunity for [COREF:Q4910865|him] to display that [COREF:Q4910865|he] was a better man than [COREF:Q348577|the [NO_COREF_ALT:Q14212|Prime Minister]], that [COREF:Q4910865|he] was more than a vindictive point-scorer, that [COREF:Q4910865|he] had policies to address [COREF:Q408|the nation]'s drift into debt and deficit. [COREF:Q4910865|He] did not take that opportunity. [COREF:Q4910865|He] missed it completely.<END>

Then there were the voyeurs of the opposition, the members waving goodbye to the Prime Minister and Treasurer Joe Hockey. They were led from the front row by Jenny Macklin, who, you would think, would know better, having reached her 60s and been in parliament for 19 years. Nineteen years in which six Labor leaders were deposed in eight leadership changes, with all but Paul Keating departing at the behest of their own colleagues (Kim Beazley, Simon Crean, Mark Latham, Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard).

The Dummy-Spit Award for the most childish member of the house was a tie between Pat Conroy and Nick Champion, both former union officials and both serial brats. Labor breeds haters. It is famous for that. Even the most colourless in its ranks, like Macklin, can revel in pettiness.

Observing all this was the omnipresent, non-partisan political editor of Sky News, David Speers, who, after noting the bilious gloating of the opposition, also noted that karma had come back to bite the Prime Minister. He pointed out that Abbott had baited Gillard with some similarly goading questions after she had suffered political near-death at the hands of her colleagues.

Karma is also repaying Abbott for his ingloriously unwise comment that "the adults are back in charge."

Tuesday was more of the same. Shorten's first question: "If good government starts today, what on earth has the Prime Minister been doing for the past 521 days?"

In summary, the second sitting day of 2015 was almost identical to the first. Unedifying.

Wednesday, however, was different. Shorten asked a series of constructive, penetrating questions. Perhaps feedback had come back that he had gone too far, been too nasty, too petty, and his gloating had been bad optics.

Dorner's 'last stand' after hiding in plain sight

13 February 2013 Last updated at 19:47 By Alastair Leithead BBC News, Big Bear Lake

Thick snow still blankets the small ski town of Big Bear Lake after a weekend storm which had hindered the search for Christopher Dorner.

<START>A massive manhunt led [Q578478|sheriffs] here last week after [COREF:Q4419912|the 33-year-old]'s truck was found burning on a mountain road.

The authorities went from house to house in the snow, looking for [COREF:Q4419912|the ex-[NO_COREF_ALT:Q384593|policeman]] who was suspected of double murder and of killing [DESC:Unknown1|a former colleague] while on the run.

They used snow cat vehicles to scour the area for any sign of [COREF:Q4419912|the 270lb (122kg) [NO_COREF_ALT:Q49085|African American]], who was not thought to have had any winter survival training.<END>

'Heartbroken'

The ex-Navy reservist and former police officer was heavily armed. As the trail appeared to go cold, there was speculation that someone else was involved - or that the burning car was a decoy.

Security was stepped up across southern California and there were long delays at the US-Mexico border as every vehicle was searched.

But it appears he was hiding out in one of the hundreds of mountain cabins in the centre of town - just half a mile from the police control centre.

"We haven't had so much excitement around here in 20 years since that armed bank robbery," one local said, getting a coffee as this tourist city 7,000ft (2,133m) up in the mountains could finally relax.

Ron White, from Big Bear Donuts, said the locals weren't afraid: "He was targeting police, not us."

Footage has emerged of the gunfight which took place at the cabin

The mayor of Big Bear Lake had said he was more worried that anyone who saw Dorner might have taken the law into their own hands.

"We are certainly very relieved that residents and tourists are now safe," Mayor Jay Obernolte told the BBC as police were still trying to identify the charred remains found in the burned-out cabin.

"But we are also heartbroken that we lost a sheriff's deputy. Our thoughts go out to his family."

He praised the action of the law enforcement agencies.

When asked how they could have missed the suspect in their search, he explained many of the cabins are holiday homes, locked up and left empty. Police could not just smash down every single door.

Who started fire?

But when Dorner decided to make a run for it back down the mountain and stole a car, the alarm was quickly raised and police were soon in pursuit.

There was an intense gunfight as he tried to escape from a mountain lodge he had barricaded himself into, no doubt aware from his military training that he would be surrounded.

The mountain roads were sealed off as dozens of police, FBI agents, sheriffs and snipers moved in.

Journalists followed the operation as it unfolded by listening into police radios.

From the recordings, since posted online, it appeared the police may have started the fire, which soon overwhelmed the wooden building.

As the lodge burned and there were mixed reports about whether or not a body had been found in the building, the authorities appeared pretty confident they had got their man.

At an Italian restaurant in Big Bear, staff and diners were relieved to hear the manhunt was finally over.

It might be a stereotype but when they said "it's such a calm place - nothing like that ever happens here," it seemed accurate in this laidback mountain town.

'Ghost town'

"A lot of citizens were worried," one diner told me. "As soon as people heard what was going on, this place was like a ghost town."

It's peak ski season and there's a great combination of California sunshine and well-covered slopes - the bars and restaurants are normally heaving.

On Wednesday morning police were still blocking roads approaching the valley where the manhunt had come to an end.

The news helicopters buzzing overhead showed there was little left of the lodge but burned timbers.

It could be some time before forensic scientists can confirm the body is Dorner, but the manhunt is over.

Life here and down the mountain in Los Angeles, is getting back to normal.

Most of the protection teams deployed to guard dozens of potential targets of the former cop's grudge have returned to normal duty - LAPD is no longer on high alert.

Efforts now will switch to establishing what drove this disgruntled former employee to go on a deadly rampage as some form of revenge.

Human rights activists criticise Egyptian president's state visit to France

Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi is in France for talks on terrorism, the Libyan conflict and other regional issues amid heavy criticism over the Egyptian leader's crackdown on dissent.

The Egyptian head of state has overseen a large crackdown on critics, jailing thousands of Islamists along with pro-democracy activists.

Over 20 human rights groups denounced France's strategic partnership with Egypt as the country "is abusively using counter-terrorist legislation to eradicate the legitimate work in favour of human rights and suppress all peaceful dissent in the country." They called for a demonstration on Tuesday near the National Assembly in Paris.

<START>[Q307871|El-Sissi] has said that [COREF:Q307871|his] tough rule has ensured stability, pointing to war and destruction in [Q858|Syria], [Q805|Yemen] and [Q1016|Libya] as the alternative.

At a press conference with [Q191954|French President] [Q3052772|Emmanuel Macron], [Q307871|el-Sissi] said: "You cannot present the state of [Q79|Egypt], with all that [COREF:Q79|it] has done for [COREF:Q79|its] people and for stability in the region, with [COREF:Q79|it] being a dictatorship."

[COREF:Q79|He] said that religious values were more important than human values.<END>

Macron said he had discussed the question of human rights with the Egyptian leader.

French authorities see Egypt as a key country in efforts to stabilise the troubled region, and Macron has warned that in the absence of Western support, Egypt could turn to the West's authoritarian rivals China and Russia.

By Alisha Rouse For The Daily Mail


Tennis champion Serena Williams has had a thinly veiled dig at her rival Maria Sharapova.

Sharapova, 30, was banned from professional tennis for 15 months for taking the banned drug meldonium.

But Williams, 35, wrote in an open letter on the chat website Reddit: "It has been said that I use drugs.

'No, I have always had far too much integrity to behave dishonestly in order to gain an advantage."

The American 39-time Grand Slam winner, who never mentions her Russian rival by name, adds in the post: "I've been called man because I appeared outwardly strong.

"It has been said I don't belong in women's sports, that I belong in men's because I look stronger than many other women do.

"No, I just work hard and I was born with this badass body and proud of it."

In her new memoir Sharapova describes being intimidated by Williams" "thick arms and thick legs."

ISTANBUL, Turkey, June 7 (UPI) -- Europeans are worried Turkey's handling of protests over a minor urban development in Istanbul is damaging the whole EU-NATO peacemaking and security project in Syria.

Turkey has staked its reputation as a non-partisan, non-Arab arbiter of disputes and flare-ups in its neighborhood and as the modern inheritor of the mantle of the old Ottoman Empire.

Arabs tolerated Turkey's role as a mediator and facilitator despite strong reservations about Ottoman rule over their lands before independence or creation of modern Arab states, preferring it to British and French mandates.

But Turkey bared new ambitions during the turmoil in Iraq after the 2003 allied invasion that brought down Saddam Hussein and more recently in Syria, both former colonies of its Ottoman predecessors.

As Syria plunged deeper into strife and thousands of Syrians sought refuge in southeastern Turkey, Ankara could convincingly argue it had a stake in Syria's future.

Europe saw Turkey as a valuable rear guard as it tried to shield itself from political and security fallout from Syria. As the Syrian conflict threatened to spill over into Turkey along with the fleeing multitudes, European defense commanders promptly sent and installed Patriot missile batteries along Turkey's Syrian border.

But it all appeared to be going wrong as Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, riding high approval ratings amid what Turks saw as their country's resurgence as a regional power, began to implement a long-cherished Islamization of the country's deeply entrenched secular society.

Last month authorities began shutting down establishments that served alcohol or what Erdogan aides saw as the lewd westernization of society. With his popularity on the rise, Erdogan easily silenced critics who saw his measures as an attempt to recast Turkey after his own Islamist model.

Turks in general are not against some Islamic elements marking day-to-day pursuits and lifestyle that link them to their heritage and tradition, but most draw a line at what they see as going beyond "moderation" -- a term open to heated debate over the decades since Kemal Ataturk ushered in the republic in 1922.

Erdogan is adamant that forces inimical to his rule rather than Turkish masses turned the Istanbul protests into a movement increasingly questioning his legitimacy.

He also shocked European partners by insisting his handling of the protests was mild compared to what EU partners would have done in similar circumstances.

European criticism of Erdogan has been sharp but cautiously coded.

The protests have also demonstrated that, through years of exposure to mainland Europe and yearning for Turkey's eventual entry into the club of nations, Turks are more Europeanized than the ruling party's ideologues.

Most Turks see the government's conduct as indicative of its eastward push rather than a westward reach to Europe and democratic values enshrined in EU rules for letting new members in.

Turkey has been vying for EU entry since 2005 but lags behind almost everyone being considered as part of EU enlargement. The eight new potential entrants are Albania, Bosnia, Croatia, Iceland, Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey.

EU Enlargement Minister Stefan Fuele, who was in Istanbul for talks, delivered a public reproach.

<START>"Peaceful demonstrations constitute a legitimate way for groups to express their views in a democratic society," [Q370164|Fuele] said.

"Excessive use of force by police against these demonstrations has no place in such a democracy."

The widely publicized chastisement was music to the ears of [Q39259|Erdogan]'s many foes on the right, left and center of [Q43|Turkey]'s volatile political spectrum. The civil strife complicates [Q43|Turkey]'s overt support for [Q858|Syria]'s armed opposition, based in [Q406|Istanbul], and a dangerous balancing act with eastern [Q12223|Kurdish] factions known to have strong links with armed groups in [Q858|Syria], [Q796|Iraq] and [Q794|Iran].<END>

Turkey is a major player in international peacemaking efforts now under way in Syria, involving negotiators from the EU, the United Nations, Russia, the United States and the Arab world.

Erdogan has banked on continued popularity, a robust economy and a strong power base within the political establishment, but his response to the protests threatens to change all that.

Istanbul and the southwestern tourism belt were the worst hit after the protests, with hotels reporting mass cancellations. Turkey's service sector provides the bulk of the national earnings -- up to 63 percent according to latest data.

As the sixth most popular tourism destination in the world, Turkey drew 31 million tourists in 2011. This week the Turkish stock market was reeling under the impact of the protests. Analysts predicted job losses in the service sector, a potent new flashpoint.

Twitter erupts into debate over what the PERFECT toasted marshmallow looks like

A viral debate has broken out on Twitter after one user shared a 'guide' that shows the different levels a marshmallow can be toasted.

Twitter user Yashar Ali shared a photo that showed marshmallows that had been toasted to different degrees ranging from one to ten to the social media platform on Sunday, July 7.

And since the image was shared, over 3,000 users have shared their opinions on the what the perfect toasted marshmallow should look like, causing a now viral debate.

The New York-based Twitter user shared the image alongside a caption that read: 'Five or six are correct.'

On the scale in the image, marshmallows ascended in order from least to most toasted, and were numbered from one to ten.

The marshmallow labelled 'one' appeared to not have been toasted, while the tenth sweet on the scale was more or less burned.

Over 3,000 users have commented on the now viral tweet, revealing what they regard as the perfect level of burned.

'It's eight or nothing. Five or six? Are you serious?' one Twitter user said.

Another said that 'eight is the only acceptable answer', while a different user wrote: 'I'd go up to 7. That one looks nice n gooey on the inside.'

<START>'Really anything from [QUANTITY|four] to [QUANTITY|seven] is acceptable. But [QUANTITY|five] is ideal,' [DESC:Unknown1|one man] said.

Meanwhile, [DESC:Unknown2|a mother-of-two] wrote: 'As an ex-Girl Scout and mom who spends every summer at Boy Scout camp with [COREF:Unknown2|my] [QUANTITY|two] sons: You need a [QUANTITY|7] or [QUANTITY|8] on that marshmallow char scale to achieve the internal molten gooey-ness to make a proper [Q2339814|S'more]...'

Similarly [DESC:Unknown3|another user], who said [COREF:Unknown3|she] was once a Girl Scout, said: '[QUANTITY|Eight] is perfect. Most needs to be toasted with a slight burned area. [COREF:Unknown3|I] was a Girl Scout.'<END>

Some others shared stronger opinions on the topic of toasting marshmallows, as one woman said: 'Anyone who chooses one-six must have some real issues in their lives......or they could be diagnosed with ADHD.'

'Always disturbed me, the people who set their marshmallows on fire. Like damn, be patient,' another said.

Meanwhile, one user shared a small 'guide' of their own, as he jokingly detailed what he believes is the meaning behind each marshmallow.

'One-two is a waste of a stick. Three-four is what you give the kids who really want one but are doing what their told.

'Five-six is good seven-eight is being thankful it didn't turn into... nine-ten is a waste of a stick, do not eat that trash,' he added.

Another said: 'Dude, no. If you can still see white, it ain't right.

'You should have to blow it out after admiring its torch-like qualities. You gotta hear that shishing [sic] sizzle.'

Other users were in total disagreement with the chart. One said: 'There's a massive spectrum between seven-nine that is not fully explored in this image.'

Another jokingly said: 'Which number is the one where your marshmallow catches on fire, then you wave the stick back and forth to put it out, and the flaming treat slips off, flies through the night air, and sticks to your friend's leg, causing third degree burns?'

'The only correct answer is zero. Graham cracker and chocolate, and NO marshmallow!' one woman said.

Former ballerina says pressure fuelled her eating disorder

A former ballerina has described how the pressure to be 'lean' led her to develop an eating disorder that nearly ended her life.

Anais Garcia, from Baltimore, Maryland, told how she starved herself in a desperate bid to please dance teachers who favoured 'taller and thinner' students.

At the height of her sickness she weighed just 80lbs (5.7st) and was told by doctors that if she danced again her heart would stop.

<START>Now [COREF:Unknown1|the 20-year-old] is recovering from the illness and is determined to help other [Q805221|dancers] struggling with body image and eating disorders.

[Unknown1|Anais], who majored in dance at a performing arts high school, said staff and [Q48282|students] placed a 'huge emphasis' on body type.

'You wear skin tight leotards and tights in front of full length mirrors for hours each day,' [COREF:Unknown1|she] said. '[COREF:Unknown1|I] was constantly told to change [COREF:Unknown1|my] body, specifically to develop longer and leaner muscles.<END>

'Many teachers promote the dancers who are thinner and taller and ignore the dancers who are not.'

Eager to win better parts, Anais started to diet. At the age of 16 she was surviving on just 600 calories a day. This developed into restriction, purging and over-exercising.

She continued: 'When I began to lose weight unhealthily, I was awarded with multiple lead roles for the first time and placed in the highest level.

'This fuelled my disorder and only made me more determined to get sicker.'

By the time she graduated, Anais was battling a severe eating disorder and was hospitalised during her first year of university.

She was forced to give up ballet and gained 20lbs. However 18 months after she returned to dance she suffered a 'very deadly relapse'.

She said: 'I was devastated because after all the sacrifice and work, I had regressed to a point even lower than before.

'This time it was different. No longer was I purging, abusing laxatives, or over exercising. This time I simply refused to eat; it was anorexia at its worst.

'I would dance for hours with nothing in my system, and I would rely on caffeine to get me through each day.'

Her turning point came when she was rushed to the emergency room after collapsing on a photo shoot.

She said: 'I felt really weak and delirious however, I wasn't scared. I thought I was going to die and I felt at peace knowing that I wouldn't suffer anymore from my eating disorder.

'It's sad to say but at the time I wouldn't have minded dying. I felt bad that my mum had to see me so sick. This event really woke me up to the reality of my disorder.'

Anais pledged to gain weight, saying she was 'fueled by her anger, determination and fear'.

She forced herself to meal prep and up her calories each week until she had reached 2000 calories a day.

She added: 'The most important thing I did was rest. My body had a lot to catch up on, so I slept for weeks.

'Slowly but surely my energy began returning and my weight began increasing.

'I only weighed myself at the doctor's office because I refused to be a slave to the scale in my own house considering I use to weigh myself after each meal.'

Now she is reclaiming control over her life both mentally and physically.

She said: 'In the past, I would turn down invitations, parties, meals, anything that possibly involved food.

'Now, I am rediscovering life and it's many benefits. I eat cake once in a while, and go out with friends when asked.

'I also recently started my blog to share my story and hopefully help others.'

Despite reaching a healthy weight, she admits she has further to go.

She added: 'I am heading in the right direction. I am only going to recover as much as my determination allows, and as of now I refuse to die.

'I am on a mission to recover fully and help others one day.'

**** ARTICLE #41: 20070928 - Tonga have been one of the major surprises in this tournament. (None) *****

Tonga have been one of the major surprises in this tournament.

After beating the USA, they upset Pacific Island neighbours Samoa before giving South Africa, one of the form sides and competition favourites, a big scare.

The Springboks, who eventually won 30-25, were forced to send their frontline players into the fray as the Tongans threatened to pull off a major upset.

Coming into the competition, Tonga, who are bidding to reach the last eight for the first time, only had two wins in three World Cups and lost every match in 2003.

"We have already made history for our country," said captain Nili Latu. "We want to go further."

Coach Quddus Fielea added: "It is very important for the boys, and I know they will be throwing everything into this game."

In contrast to Tonga, England have failed to play to their potential in this World Cup.

After beating the USA, they were crushed 36-0 by South Africa before bouncing back with a 44-22 win over Samoa.

Now their chances of progressing face another serious threat - and England coach Brian Ashton is under no illusions about the size of the task facing his side.

"We are still looking down the barrel of a gun," he said.

"Tonga are probably a stronger side than Samoa and they are no longer the surprise team. They've played pretty well throughout and we have enormous respect for them.

"They have a massive enthusiasm, cohesion up front and an ability to stay in the game for 80 minutes, which has not always been the case.

"Any momentary lapse in concentration could cause us lots of problems."

With prop Vickery starting the game on the bench following his two-game ban, Martin Corry will skipper the side.

And the Leicester forward says the team will not make the mistake of underestimating Tonga.

"We are going to have to win the game, and we expect to win the game, but that is taking nothing away from Tonga," he said.

"They are coming into this game full of confidence, but we are just focusing on ourselves and looking to improve on what we did against Samoa."

Ashton has made some bold choices in his selection, leaving Vickery on the bench and bringing Lewis Moody in at open-side flanker for his first start of the tournament.

But Jonny Wilkinson will continue his half-back partnership with scrum-half Andy Gomarsall.

<START>[Q318920|Wilkinson] missed the [QUANTITY|first] [QUANTITY|two] games of [COREF:Q124753|the tournament] because of an ankle injury but kicked [QUANTITY|24] points on [COREF:Q318920|his] return as [Q378628|England] beat [Q3590539|Samoa].

[COREF:Q318920|He] now needs another [QUANTITY|22] points to become the record points scorer in [Q16640|World Cups], eclipsing the [QUANTITY|227] amassed by [Q945016|Scotland] great [Q427291|Gavin Hastings].

[Q378628|England] and [Q3590551|Tonga] have met only once before in an officially recognised Test. It came in the [Q1141048|1999 World Cup], with [Q378628|England] easing to a [QUANTITY|101]-[QUANTITY|10] victory.<END>

But this time round promises to be a lot closer, with Latu promising: "We are going to throw the kitchen sink at England.

"People back home have been over the moon with what we have done, and it is rewarding for us to see where the country is now. Even being here is bringing Tongans together as one, but it's not just for us.

"We are here to do a job and change the face of rugby in the Islands, and in Tonga especially."

The Tongans had planned to take to the field with their hair dyed green to thank an Irish bookmaker for supporting them financially in France.

But the International Rugby Board says that would constitute advertising and has ordered Tonga not to go ahead with the publicity stunt.

Storm Otto kills four in Costa Rica, moves out to Pacific

SAN JOSE Tropical storm Otto killed at least four people and forced thousands to evacuate after battering Nicaragua and Costa Rica with hurricane-force winds and torrential rains, then moved out into the Pacific Ocean.

Otto hit the coast on Thursday from the Atlantic as a hurricane in southeastern Nicaragua, but weakened rapidly and became a tropical storm by early Friday as it drifted deeper into the Pacific, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.

In Costa Rica, the national emergency commission (CNE) reported that two men and two women were killed by the storm, which dumped over a month's worth of rain in some areas near the Nicaraguan border. Some 255 communities were affected, with over 5,500 people housed in 50 shelters across the country, the CNE said.

"After a fateful night in parts of the country, we're starting to realize the scale of the tragedy that hit us," Costa Rican President Luis Guillmero Solis told a news conference.

Nevertheless, in Nicaragua, there were no immediate reports of deaths. In the port of Bluefields, north of where the storm landed, there was very limited damage.

"It was a relief for us," said William Salmeron, a 39-year-old businessman in the city. "I wasn't scared, just the normal fear you need to have with hurricanes."

The sun shone in Bluefields on Friday, and people went shopping in the market. Down by the shore, others took their boats out of storage and down to the water.

<START>Across [Q811|Nicaragua], people in evacuation shelters were making their way home, local authorities said.

[Q27906759|Otto], the [QUANTITY|seventh] [Q97|Atlantic] hurricane of the season, landed north of the town of [Q8965091|San Juan de Nicaragua] as a Category 2 storm, the [Q8652|Miami]-based [Q1329523|NHC] said.

By [DATETIME|Friday] morning [Q27906759|Otto] was heading out to the [Q98|Pacific] with top sustained winds of [QUANTITY|65] mph ([QANTITY|105] kph) and churning about [QUANTITY|245] miles ([QUANTITY|394] km) south-southeast of [Q3110|San Salvador].<END>

In a freakish coincidence, soon after Otto landed on Thursday, a 7.0-magnitude quake struck 93 miles (149 km) southwest of Puerto Triunfo, El Salvador.

There were no reports of major damage from the quake, which along with Otto, prompted Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega to declare a state of emergency.

US Must Speed Up Weapons for Iraq

By LOLITA C. BALDOR Associated Press Writer

The Associated Press


The United States must deliver weapons to Iraq more quickly, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Thursday, in the wake of an announcement that the Iraqis have ordered $100 million in military equipment from China.

<START>[COREF:Q212979|He] agreed that there are concerns that it is harder for the [Q11211|U.S. military] in [Q796|Iraq] to track weapons purchased from countries other than [Q30|America]. In many cases, the [Q796|Iraqis] cannot account for weapons, which often end up in the hands of insurgents.

Speaking to [Q42909|reporters], [Q212979|Gates] said the issue also came up at [COREF:Q212979|his] meeting with [Q55717944|Chilean Defense Minister] [Q3186309|Jose Mario Goni] just prior to a [Q38926|news] conference.

"This is an issue that we have to look into and see what we can do in the [Q30|United States] to be more responsive and be able to react more quickly to the requests of our friends," [Q212979|Gates] said. "Unfortunately the [Q842161|([Q842161|foreign military sales]) program] was set up in a way that was not intended to provide sort of emergency or short term supplies."<END>

The Washington Post reported Thursday that Iraqi President Jalal Talabani said in an interview that Iraq ordered the Chinese weapons for its police force in part because the U.S. is not delivering the arms fast enough.

For a meat sauce:

<START>1. Start with the classic [Q38|Italian] trio of onions, celery and carrot diced really fine, with a couple of cloves of garlic.

2. Sweat that down, don't brown it, until it's really soft.

3. Add your meat - I really like to use pork and sage in a lasagne. Brown off meat and add sage then add a glug of wine.<END>

4. Next add some whole plum tomatoes, tinned, and sweat that down.

5. Add puree, some stock, salt and sugar to counteract the acidity of the tomatoes, some chilli flakes and let that bubble down for about two hours.

For plain tomato sauce:

1. Sweat down the Italian trio with garlic, with herbs, salt and sugar again. The longer you cook it, the better.

If you do it in a rush, then you get that metallic taste that doesn't actually taste like a good tomato sauce.

Hangzhou Municipal Government Selects TIBCO Software for Enhancing Efficiency of E-Government Services

/PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- TIBCO Software Inc. (Nasdaq: TIBX) today announced
that the Hangzhou Municipal Government has successfully completed the
deployment of TIBCO Enterprise Message Service (TM) and TIBCO ActiveMatrix
BusinessWorks (TM) for its government information sharing and business
collaboration initiative to facilitate the integration and real-time flow of
data across its information systems.

<START>Prior to the project, cross-departmental information sharing had been a
major challenge for the municipal authorities, as various departments had
adopted differing technology standards. In addition, the Web sites of the
various levels of government -- from the municipality down to villages and
townships -- had been developed independently, impeding timely information
distribution to the public. However, using the [Unknown1|[Q513861|TIBCO] Enterprise Message
Service] as its information backbone and [Unknown2|[Q513861|TIBCO] ActiveMatrix BusinessWorks] for
software integration through service-oriented architecture, the municipal
government's information sharing and business collaboration initiative has
been able to leverage its existing information systems, while paving the way
for future services and growth.

"[Q513861|TIBCO]'s integration and real-time information processing solutions have
allowed us to create a centralized, multi-level framework for information
cataloging and sharing, even though our data exchanges are physically
dispersed. The near instantaneous access to information we gain from this
system across multiple departments empowers us to carry out our duties,
including tax administration and regulatory enforcement, more efficiently, and
make better policy decisions for our people," said [Unknown2|Guo Liqiao], [Q25378518|deputy director]
of [Unknown3|Hangzhou Municipal Government Informatization Office].

[Unknown2|Mr. Guo] said [Q513861|TIBCO] was selected for the e-government project after an
evaluation of several integration and real-time information processing
solutions, and an onsite visit to one of [Q513861|TIBCO]'s other customers.<END>

"TIBCO's software was simply the fastest, most secure and most reliable
solution we evaluated. And importantly, TIBCO allowed us to achieve real-time
data exchange in a multi-vendor environment, so we did not need to replace the
incompatible legacy applications and platforms that had been deployed
throughout government," Mr. Guo explained.

As the informatization of the civil services government continues to
gather momentum across China, TIBCO has set its sights on increasing its
penetration into the country's e-government market.

"Bringing government services online will have a number of tangible
benefits for both the authorities and the public. While enabling authorities
to perform administrative duties and disseminate information quickly and more
efficiently, e-government will also provide individuals and businesses with
easier access to information, streamlined reporting requirements and faster
transaction channels. The savings in time and money for everyone are
potentially enormous," said Ram Menon, executive vice president, Worldwide
Marketing, at TIBCO Software.

CNN anchors favor iPads over sponsor Microsoft's tablet on Election Night - RT USA

Microsoft Surface, iPad. (Reuters / Robert Galbrait / David McNew)

It appears that both the Democrats and Microsoft took a beating on Tuesday, after CNN presenters ignored a corporate sponsorship deal by turning the tech giant's $799 Surface tablet into the world's most expensive iPad kickstand on air.

<START>[Q48340|CNN] received the [Q17042552|[Q17042552|Surface Pro 3] tablets] from [Q2283|Microsoft] as part of an [DESC:Q7892464|election 2014] partnership deal, along with an updated [Q6934414|Multi-Touch Collaboration Wall], colloquially known as [OPTIONAL:Q6934414|CNN's "[OPTIONAL:Q6934414|Magic Wall],"] to be used on air.

And while [COREF:Q17042552|the [NO_COREF_ALT:Q2283|Microsoft] tablets] were featured prominently during [Q48340|CNN]'s [DATETIME|Tuesday] night [Q7892464|election] coverage, it was what was going on behind the scenes that really got everyone's attention.

While the "barricade of [Q17042552|Pro 3s]" managed to cover the clandestine [Q2796|iPad] activity during straight shots, the panning camera revealed [Q6125032|Jake Tapper] tapping away on [COREF:Q6125032|his] [Q2796|iPad] one finger at a time.<END>

In another shot, political contributor Ana Navarro could clearly be seen using her Pro 3 to prop up her Apple tablet.

Astute social media users quickly began circulating the images online, a few employing the hashtag #productplacementfail.

This is not the first time Microsoft has ended up with egg on its face after inking a promotional deal to pull its Pro 3 out from under a massive apple-shaped shadow.

Earlier this year, Microsoft and the NFL agreed upon a five-year $400 million deal which required that the Microsoft Surface became "the official tablet of the NFL." During live broadcasts, coaches and players were expected to use the tablet on the sidelines during games. It must have been a bitter (and expensive) pill to swallow when commentators began referring to the Surface as "iPad-like tools" or even simply "iPads."

Speaking with CNet, CNN's chief synergizer, Matt Dornic, said their arrangement with Microsoft was nothing like the NFL deal. According to Dornic, the Surfaces were there to help connect with CNNs Magic Wall, which works best with Microsoft's Internet Explorer.

"There was no product-placement deal," he said.

Microsoft is yet to comment on the incident.

After years of being on and off, his relationship with Karrueche Tran came to a nasty end when she filed a restraining order against him, citing threats of violence.

But Chris Brown showed that he's apparently happily moved on from his tumultuous romance, as he stepped out with a new lady on his arm when attending DJ Khaled's star-studded birthday bash in Beverly Hills on Saturday night.

The Look At Me Now hitmaker, 28, sported a broad grin as he arrived at the celebratory gathering with Indonesian pop sensation Agnez Mo, 31 - with whom he recently sparked romance rumours after he was seen cosying up to her in a studio

Last month, Chris took to Instagram to share a shot of himself inside a recording studio with Agnez, nuzzling her neck as he placed an arm around her waist.

Stating only that he had some 'hot s**t cooking, he gave no indication of the nature of their relationship, although their familiar pose sparked romance speculation.

And last week, he returned to the photo-sharing app to upload an image of the singer posing in an ensemble from his Black Pyramid clothing line.

Agnez, who rose to fame as a child in Indonesia, made strides into the US market with the released of her latest album, X.

Of her new audience, she recently told HollywoodLife: 'I don't have to introduce myself in Indonesia, because they witnessed by journey. Here, I kind of have to do a recap of my 25-year career.

2020 Democratic candidates - CNNPolitics

Here's a look at the Democrats who have thrown their hats into the ring. We're going to keep updating this list through the campaign season as candidates announce their intentions or drop their bids.

STATE: New Jersey

KNOWN FOR: Booker, who boasts a Twitter following of more than 4 million people, gained national recognition during his tenure as Newark's mayor, at times answering pleas to shovel residents out after major snowstorms.



KNOWN FOR: The son of a Chicana activist, Castro served as mayor of San Antonio in 2009, focusing on education initiatives. Castro is currently the only Latino in the 2020 field, but whether he will be the only Texan will depend on former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke's decision about making his own bid.


STATE: Maryland

KNOWN FOR: A self-made businessman, Delaney at one point was the youngest CEO on the New York Stock Exchange. Delaney has been running the longest -- he declared his candidacy in July 2017 -- but is still working to gain name recognition.






STATE: California


STATE: Colorado

KNOWN FOR: As the head of Colorado from 2011 to 2019, Hickenlooper helped steer the state through several tragedies, including the 2012 shooting in a movie theater in Aurora that left 12 people dead and catastrophic wildfires and floods in 2013. Before his two terms as governor, he served as Denver's mayor for eight years, after opening a large brewpub there in 1988 that went on to help reinvigorate the LoDo area of Denver.


STATE: Washington

KNOWN FOR: Inslee, who has held elected office for much of the last three decades, has been an outspoken progressive executive since he became governor in 2013. He has been a vocal opponent of President Donald Trump, including suing the President after he tried to ban immigration from several Muslim-majority countries. Now, Inslee is running as the climate change candidate.

KNOWN FOR: Klobuchar announced her run outdoors as it snowed, which she tied to her commitment to a "homegrown" campaign with "grit." The Minnesota moderate is looking to work across the aisle and win back fellow working class midwesterners.


STATE: Florida

KNOWN FOR: The child of Jamaican immigrants, Messam is a first-generation American who holds progressive views on immigration, guns and the environment. He was part of a group that sued the state of Florida in 2018 over a law that restricted his ability to create municipal gun regulations after he wanted a new amphitheater in his city to be a "gun-free venue."



KNOWN FOR: O'Rourke, a rising star in the Democratic Party, ran unsuccessfully for a Senate seat in 2018 while serving his third term in the House. With roots in El Paso, O'Rourke gained national attention during his Senate race when a video of him answering a question about NFL players kneeling during the National Anthem went viral. He made an off-the-cuff riff about the civil rights movement as he defended players for making their case "nonviolently, peacefully, while the eyes of this country are watching."



KNOWN FOR: Ryan, whose district includes Youngstown, Ohio, enters the presidential race as a longshot candidate with less name recognition than most candidates and a far smaller political network. He has become most known in Democratic circles for his opposition to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi retaining her leadership positions, though he later voted for her when Democrats elected her speaker earlier this year.


STATE: Vermont

KNOWN FOR: Sanders' democratic socialist platform gained significant traction during the 2016 primaries, when the independent senator who caucuses with Democrats ran against Hillary Clinton.

Manchester United transfer news and rumours: Kevin Strootman blow; Aleksandar Dragovic delay; Adnan Januzaj exit blocked

The likelihood of Kevin Strootman arriving at Old Trafford before the current transfer window closes appears to have receded after the Roma midfielder picked up a fresh injury. The Dutchman only returned to action late last year after a nine-month injury lay-off and the latest set-back highlights the concern that still surrounds him. Roma coach Rudi Garcia has admitted it is "still a delicate area."

Manchester United face competition from Real Madrid in their bid to sign Athletic Bilbao defender Aymeric Laporte. The highly-rated 20-year-old has been linked with a move to the Premier League, and United are ready to firm that up with a bid for the France Under-21 international, according to the Daily Mail. However, with Sergio Ramos stalling on a new contract at the Bernabeu, the European champions have entered the race to sign Laporte from their La Liga rivals.

Council members, pension board wrangle over fossil-fuel investments

After 11 drafts and months of behind-the-scenes negotiations, a bill to start divesting Montgomery County's employee pension funds from fossil-fuel company stocks is nowhere near a final vote.

Fossil-fuel holdings represent just $70 million of the county's $4 billion pension portfolio. But the debate has become a broader fight over power, prerogative and the best way for the liberal-minded county to fight climate change.

The bill, sponsored by Council President Roger Berliner (D-Potomac-Bethesda) and Council member Nancy Navarro (D-Mid-County), has drawn fierce opposition from many retirees as well as the board that oversees their money.

The thirteen-member Board of Investment Trustees regards the bill as unwarranted interference with the panel's legal obligation to maximize returns.

Board chairman Gino Renne told county lawmakers that there is no disagreement about the moral urgency of limiting climate change. But policies are in place directing professional fund managers to seek out socially responsible investments, he said, rendering the legislative proposal unnecessary.

<START>"None of us on the board disagrees with the goal. We're not taking a blind eye to [Q7942|climate change]," [Unknown1|Renne] said [DATETIME|Thursday] at a council committee work session on the bill. "Trust us. We're not novices."

The proposal is supported by the [Q488659|Montgomery] chapter of [Q2091619|350.org], the grass-roots group whose name refers to the level of atmospheric [Q1997|carbon dioxide] many [Q901|scientists] say [DESC:Q2|the planet] must achieve to avoid the most severe consequences of [Q7942|climate change].

Passage of the bill would make [COREF:Q488659|the county] one of the largest jurisdictions in [DESC:Q30|the country] to join the fossil-fuel divestiture movement. [Q62|San Francisco], [Q5083|Seattle] and [Q6106|Portland] are among the localities that have approved some form of divestment.<END>

Since the bill's introduction last fall, Berliner has agreed to significant revisions. A measure requiring complete divestment after five years has been dropped. New language sharpens a provision that the board would not be required to do anything it considered inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under law.

Berliner expressed exasperation that opponents were not reassured by his amendments. He noted that the board has opposed past efforts by the council to regulate certain county investments to advance social or political interests.

In 1986, the council enacted a law requiring the board to restrict certain investments in companies doing business in South Africa. The measure was rolled back when apartheid ended. In 2008, the council barred investments in companies doing business in Sudan.

"I and some of my colleagues just struggle as to whether this is in fact drawing a line in the sand saying . . . keep your nose out of our business," Berliner said.

Renne and Linda Herman, the board's executive director, agreed to continue discussions with the council and reconvene on the issue later this month.

Keel authenticated for new Virginia-class attack sub New Jersey

March 26 (UPI) -- A keel authentication ceremony was conducted for the New Jersey, a Virginia-class attack submarine, at Huntington Ingalls Industries' Newport News Shipbuilding division in Virginia.

Ship sponsor Susan DiMarco, a retired dentist, chalked her initials onto a metal plate as her husband, former Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson and their son, Jeh Johnson Jr., who serves in the U.S. Coast Guard, watched Monday.

"I am extremely proud to sponsor the submarine New Jersey, named for my home state," DiMarco said in a company news release. "My family prides itself on service to our great country, and I am pleased to contribute in this way."

Shipbuilder Jess Batruk, who is originally from New Jersey, then traced the initials with a welding torch.

Her work signifies the keel of SSN 796 as being "truly and fairly laid."

"We enjoy participating in the Navy's many traditions," said Jennifer Boykin, president of Newport News Shipbuilding. "They offer us an opportunity to pause and reflect on our daily work and remind the talented shipbuilders and the crew of the important role we all play in something much greater than ourselves -- our nation's defense.

Construction of the New Jersey, which is the 23rd Virginia-class fast attack submarine, began in March 2016 and is about 42 percent complete. The company is scheduled to deliver the ship to the Navy in 2021.

Seventeen Virginia-class submarines have been commissioned, and 11 are under construction.

All but two of subs -- the John Warner and the Hyman G Rickover -- are named after states.

The New Jersey was named in 2015 in Jersey City,

<START>"[Q1408|New Jersey]'s relationship with our [Q11220|Navy] has been defined by innovation, leadership, and courage- in conquest and in combat," [Q940135|Secretary of the Navy] [Q531247|Ray Mabus] said at the time. "The name of our newest nuclear-powered fast-attack submarine will carry on that strong tradition."

The [Q11220|Navy]'s [QUANTITY|first] submarine, [Q1209110|USS Holland], was designed and constructed in [DATETIME|1900] in [Q1408|New Jersey].

[QUANTITY|Two] naval ships have been named New Jersey, [DESC:Q2703928|[DESC:Q2703928|a battleship commissioned in [DATETIME|1906]] that was part of the [Q782583|Great White Fleet]] and [DESC:Q507603|another battleship commissioned in [DATETIME|1943]].<END>

Each Virginia-class submarine is 7,800 tons and 377 feet in length, and can operate at more than 25 knots submerged. Because of a nuclear reactor plant, the subs won't require refueling during the planned life of the ship.

Port Adelaide has to "man up," says Power coach Ken Hinkley

AFL: With just two fit men on the bench Sydney looked down and out. But the Swans showed courage to post a gutsy win and leave Port Adelaide's premiership hopes in tatters.

KEN Hinkley has one simple message for Port Adelaide - "Man, up" or perish.

Hinkley has demanded his men show the gumption that depleted Sydney delivered as they scored a 10-point win without injured midfielder Gary Rohan (hamstring) and key defender Ted Richards.

It was a case of "no Kurt Tippett, no Lance Franklin, no issue" as Sam Reid and Adam Goodes shared six goals against a Port defence missing a sick Jackson Trengove.

Tippett and Franklin were watching from the stands as a 199cm former Tasmanian fast bowler, Toby Nankervis, celebrated his debut with a second term goal.

"Our own skill errors are killing us at times," said Hinkley referring to Port's 65 turnovers against the Swans - including with Jasper Pittard's last-quarter error which handed Lewis Jetta a crucial final-term goal.

"It's the pressure they (the Power players) feel out on the footy field but you have to be better than that. Man up, that's what we have to do in those times."

However Pittard wasn't Port worst player.

[Q6167166|Jay Schulz] is unlikely to front next week due to concerning form or pending suspension.<END>

Hinkley refuses to give up on the season but Port needs to prevail in eight of nine games starting next Thursday against Collingwood at Adelaide Oval.

"Richmond won nine of nine last year, it is always there and we cling to the chance we can turn our form around and get it back to where it needs to be," said Hinkley.

"It is starting to get harder and harder."

Play was stopped for six minutes after Richards" injury at the 10-minute mark of the third term from a Schulz tackle.

Hinkley noted the game changed from that moment, though Port had threatened to run away from a tiring Sydney. Instead two goals from Adam Goodes provided a 24-point three-quarter time lead.

"I thought there was a crucial moment in the game," said Hinkley.

"The momentum was in our favour and you have to admire, tough hard footy - we didn't stand up for 16 or 17 minutes in the back half of the third quarter the way you have to in footy.

"Our history says we have to fight harder and we weren't prepared to."

Global pop star Elton John copped a taste of Victoria's temperamental weather last night while on stage.

After temps soared to upwards of 40C during the day, Melbourne (and Elton) were both with a downpour in the evening.

Fans who captured the moment took to social media to share the "raincheck."

Unfortunately, the show could not go on.

"Due to tonight's short but heavy downpour that occurred 95 minutes into Elton John's set resulting in damage to musical instruments and monitors on stage, the show could not continue," a post on the event's Facebook page said.

The state's been lashed by wild weather since last week, with sweltering hot and humid conditions set to return to the state.

On Friday, the state's emergency services minister had warned of flash flooding and rain after a day of intense heat and humidity that caused power outages and prompted calls to reduce electricity usage.

An extreme heatwave - the most intense you can get that affects both the fit and healthy and the vulnerable - is engulfing southeastern Australia, with several states bracing for wild weather this weekend.

Authorities are facing a number of extremes over the weekend, including heat, dust, fire and thunderstorms.

Temperatures reached almost 43C at Melbourne Park just after 3pm on Friday making the state feel more like Darwin with its tropical, oppressive weather.

Sweltering heat disrupted transmission lines on Friday, and Victorians were urged to switch off non-essential appliances until 9pm to prevent a blackout. The heat also worsened bushfire conditions, with severe danger forecast for Friday.


Top temps will vary around the country this weekend. Sydney-siders can expect between 34C and 44C in parts of the city on Saturday, and a high of 34C on Sunday.

Hobart will hit a max of 25C on Saturday and 22C on Sunday, with scattered showers throughout the weekend.

In Adelaide, a top of 25C was expected on Saturday, cooling own to 22C on Sunday.

Despite sweltering through 43C on Friday, temps in Melbourne are set to hit 32C on Saturday before dropping to 23C on Sunday.

Perth has a sunny weekend ahead, with a max of 29C expected on Saturday and a top of 34C on Sunday.

During a high-dollar fund-raiser in Texas, Mr. Trump urged several donors to stand up and describe finding the bodies of migrants. The president, pictured arriving in San Antonio, said that he had never heard the stories of migrants dying, even from his top immigration and border patrol officials.

"Dangerous people are coming here and the good people are dying," Mr. Trump said, adding that all the donors had told him that building a border wall was the answer.

For years, both political parties have tried - and failed - to overhaul the nation's immigration laws, mindful that someday the system could reach a breaking point. That time may be now, our reporters write in a sweeping analysis.

"The more fossils that people pull out of the ground, the more we realize that the variation that was present in the past far exceeds what we see in us today," one paleoanthropologist said.

Have a companionable night.

**** ARTICLE #59: 20170324 - House Of Cards' Frank Underwood uses murder as slogan inspiration in new trailer (None) *****
House Of Cards' Frank Underwood uses murder as slogan inspiration in new trailer

It seems the new season of House Of Cards is on track to be another darkly comical cracker.

For in a new teaser trailer for the show shameless President Frank Underwood seems to have used his murder of reporter lover Zoe Barnes to inspire a campaign slogan.

Of course it could be just a coincidence that the poster bearing the words 'putting America back on track' are shown after the camera pans up from a floral tribute laid on a subway track similar to the one where he killed a lover in season two.

Scroll down for video

Or perhaps, more ominously for TV's favourite seemingly unstoppable antihero, it could be the case that some chickens are going to finally come home to roost.

For while he thought he had got away with pushing Kate Mara's journalist character Zoe Barnes to her death in the second season, these things have a way of catching up to people in TV land.

Especially as Frank fired his biographer Thomas Yates in season three, and who seems keen on digging up dirt on his former employer as a means to make his book a bestseller.

Given the character's past behaviour however, it would not be outside the realm of possibility he could again try to murder an opponent, with the floral tribute merely foreshadowing the event.

Throw in the fact his wife Claire, played by Robin Wright, had decided to split from her husband at the end of the last season and it is clear there are plenty of bumps on the road to the character's reelection in the forthcoming series of the Netflix show.

Last month the show caused a stir after a Frank Underwood campaign ad aired during a Republican Party presidential debate.

A patriotic reel showed a tractor in a corn field, electricity pylons standing tall against the sunrise and a soldier in desert camouflage was seen being greeted by his family as he arrived home while air force jets took off from an aircraft carrier at sea.

Eventually the video switches to Frank who's sitting at his desk in the Oval office writing with a fountain pen.

10 signs you're at a Burns Night supper

There might be a few sore heads this morning, as Scottish people and Scotland enthusiasts recover from celebrating Burns Night, a tribute to the noted poet and a good excuse to get together for food, drinks and good times. We heard from people celebrating across the world, from pipers in Catalonia to rousing toasts in Montana. There was even a kilt spottd in Shanghai, albeit alongside a giant mechanical horse.

From all the pictures and stories we received, certain themes emerged. Below, we list 10 signs you're probably at a Burns Night supper.

1) You've dug out your best Saltire

2) Kilts abound in your surroundings

Gunman's 'attack on Israeli gay community'

A gunman killed two people and wounded at least 12 in an attack on a gay youth centre in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv last night. Police said the attack appeared to be criminal rather than terrorist. Witnesses said the gunman, dressed in black, fired indiscriminately after entering the Cafe Noir, in the centre of the city.

The gunman burst into the basement of the Tel Aviv Gay and Lesbian Association and sprayed the interior, where a support group for gay teenagers was being held, with automatic rifle fire. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said it was "most likely a criminal attack and not a terror attack."

Police are searching the area for the gunman, who fled the scene, he said. Roadblocks were set up.

Rescue services said six of the wounded were badly hurt. "This was a hate crime, a premeditated attack," witness Yaniv Weisman told Channel 10 TV. He said Cafe Noir, the basement club, was popular with youth.

<START>"Those hurt were very young," [COREF:Unknown1|he] said.

New Delhi:

A group of around 25 migrant labourers have been without food, water and other basic amenities for the last three days at the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border.

"I and many others with me in the group have not had food and water for the last three days. We are desperate to go to our villages in Hardoi, Uttar Pradesh. We were stopped here. Children have not eaten anything. What I can do," Sunita, a migrant labourer, told ANI.

According to her, they were stopped at the border today while going to their village. "We have not eaten food for the last three days. We will die of hunger, if not of coronavirus," she said.

2nd blast draws scrutiny to alternative-energy firms

The scenes were oddly similar.

On June 17, 2010, an explosion at a Simi Valley alternative energy company blew off part of the roof and caused parts of the building to collapse. Employee Tyson Larson, 28, was killed and two others injured.

On Tuesday, another explosion rocked an alternative energy company in Sylmar, tearing a hole in the roof and shattering windows of neighboring businesses. This time Timothy Larson, a veteran Los Angeles city firefighter who has been on disability leave for several years, was critically injured. Another employee was also injured.

<START>[Q30093123|Investigators] are now looking into the connection between the [QUANTITY|two] companies, both of which are owned by [Unknown1|Timothy A. Larson], the father of the two men.

In [Q323414|Simi Valley], [COREF:Unknown2|the company] operated under the names [OPTIONAL:Unknown2|Realm Catalyst Inc.] and [OPTIONAL:Unknown2|Realm Industries]. An explosion at [COREF:Unknown2|the company] in [DATETIME|2008] blew out the garage door of [QUANTITY|one] of [COREF:Unknown2|its] nearby offices, said [Unknown3|Bill Nash], a [Q17221|spokesman] for the [Q7920374|Ventura County Fire Department].

[QUANTITY|Two] years later, the massive fatal explosion forced [Q107711|firefighters] to evacuate nearby areas and resulted in [QUANTITY|three] citations totaling more than $[QUANTITY|5,600] after a [Q16937673|California Division of Occupational Safety and Health] investigation. [Q30093123|Investigators] said [COREF:Unknown2|the company] had used an air compressor and [QUANTITY|two] pressure vessel tanks that [COREF:Unknown2|it] was not permitted to use, and that [COREF:Unknown2|it] used altered tanks in a way that were not "good engineering practice" and "not in accordance with" national standards.<END>

The company was in the process of appealing the citations and a hearing was held Tuesday before an appeals board judge in Van Nuys, said Erika Monterroza, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Industrial Relations. She had not received a report on the results of the hearing as of Wednesday evening, she said.

Tuesday's explosion occurred while workers were transferring hydrogen gas from one cylinder to another, Monterroza said. Fire officials said the company was in the business of extracting hydrogen from water to create an alternative-fuel source.

A few months after his death, Tyson Larson was granted a patent for a process he and a co-inventor named William A. Stehl said could create energy from water molecules by using an electrical circuit to create resonance in the molecule. The energy they created, they said, could be used to power motorized vehicles.

Stehl was indicted last year in U.S. District Court in northern New York on charges of selling investors on a similar process to create energy from water. The indictment alleged that Stehl and a co-defendant sold investors on the process but used the money for personal expenditures.

That case is ongoing and was scheduled to go to trial in September.

The California Division of Occupational Safety and Health has said it will investigate the latest blast. The Los Angeles Fire Department's arson/counter-terrorism section will also investigate.

Bankrupt man with 'sick' foot fetish caught filming girls as young as eight

A bankrupt man with a foot fetish has avoided jail after he was caught filming girls as young as eight in an Aldi store.

Kristian Stephan, 38, filmed the legs and feet of young girls 'for his own sexual gratification' in the supermarket and in the city centre of Solihull, West Midlands, a court was told.

He was spotted by security guards after staff noticed him acting suspiciously and initially thought he was a shoplifter.

Stephan, of Aldridge, Walsall, swerved a jail sentence at Birmingham Magistrates' Court after pleading guilty to two counts of outraging public decency.

He was handed a three-year community order - the maximum length available.

The 38-year-old was first spotted acting suspiciously in Shirley's Aldi store on April 19 this year, the court heard.

Magistrates were told staff initially suspected him of being a shoplifter. A PCSO was asked to watch him before staff spotted Stephan on CCTV 'filming a child of around 12 years of age from the waist down'.

<START>The court heard the incident was reported to police but [Unknown1|Stephan] was not detained at the time.

On [DATETIME|May 5], [DESC:Unknown2|a [Q856887|security guard]] at [Q6123139|Boots] saw [Unknown1|Stephan] bending down near [QUANTITY|two] girls aged around [QUANTITY|eight] and [QUANTITY|11], filming them from the waist down on [COREF:Unknown1|his] phone.

[Unknown3|David Devine], prosecuting, said: '[COREF:Unknown2|He] approached [Unknown1|Mr Stephan]. [COREF:Unknown2|The [NO_COREF_ALT:Q856887|guard]] said [COREF:Unknown2|he] felt shocked and outraged as [COREF:Unknown2|he] has nieces of a similar age. [COREF:Unknown2|He] said [COREF:Unknown2|he] felt sickened by [Unknown1|Mr Stephan]'s behaviour.'<END>

Magistrates were told the guard challenged Stephan, who told him he was doing 'nothing wrong' and he planned to 'delete the video anyway'.

He walked out of the store but was detained and arrested by police who had been called by Boots staff.

Mr Devine said Stephan admitted to both offences at police interview. He also admitted his motives.

'He did it for his own sexual gratification. He told police he had a sexual fetish for feet and that he finds it hard to control his sexual needs.'

Following the Boots incident, police carried out a search of Stephan's property and found a small quantity of cannabis in a plastic box. He also pleaded guilty to a charge of possession of the drug.

Stephan, who declined legal representation in court, told magistrates on Tuesday: 'I apologise sincerely. I am having counselling and just trying to change my life around.

'I went bankrupt. That's not an excuse but I was in a rut. In a way, this thing that happened to me, it stopped me going out there again.'

Appearing on Wednesday for sentencing he told magistrates hewas seeing a psychiatrist and working ten hours a day.

He said: 'It is horrendous what I did. I have never done anything like this before. I got myself into a horrendous rut. I have no excuse. There is no excuse for what I have done.'

He had no previous convictions and the court heard he was of previous good character.

Stephan said he did not have a solicitor because he did not want 'someone to make out I have done nothing wrong', but he challenged part of a pre-sentence report presented to the court.

'The report says I am going to be a threat to society but I am not a threat to anyone. I have already promised many people this is not going to happen again,' he said.

He must complete a 60-day rehabilitation order, a 60-day programme to target sexual offending and 100 hours unpaid work.

He was ordered to pay court costs of £185 and an £85 victim surcharge.

By Associated Press


St. Petersburg's stadium for the 2018 World Cup held its first game Saturday with much fanfare, a ragged pitch and three red cards.

Construction on the 69,000-seat arena, named simply the St. Petersburg Stadium, started in 2007 but was repeatedly delayed and experienced several scandals, including corruption cases and workers' deaths.

Troubles continued at Saturday's opening game, with the field appearing to be in poor condition. There were large brown patches and chunks of the pitch frequently came loose.

The 69,000-seater stadium was only part-full as the top tier remained closed for the clash

Goals from Branislav Ivanovic (centre) and substitute Yohan Mollo secured a 2-0 victory

The grass had to be replaced recently after turf on the first field died. Lack of light has been blamed because the stadium's roof has often been closed and the mechanism allowing the retractable field to be moved outside isn't in use. That had to be fixed recently after complaints it was making the entire field wobble.

Visiting team Ural Yekaterinburg finished with just eight men as they were beaten 2-0 by Zenit St. Petersburg.

The stadium was only partly full because organizers decided not to open the top tier.

Former Chelsea defender defender Branislav Ivanovic scored with a header in the 86th minute, swiftly followed by Ural's third red card - this time for Emelyanov after he and Zenit's Artyom Dzyuba shoved each other.

Substitute Yohan Mollo added a second goal for the hosts in stoppage time.

Designed to look like a spaceship on the shore of the Baltic Sea, the St. Petersburg Stadium will host the Confederations Cup final this year and a World Cup semifinal in 2018.

"Bushfire risk is increasing across the country mainly due to higher temperatures coupled with lower humidity and higher evaporation rates," Mr Leplastrier said.

According to IAG estimates, rebuilding a typical four-bedroom home in a high-risk bushfire area can cost more than $100,000 extra to meet upgraded bushfire standards.

Homeowners may not be prepared for the costs of cleaning up if they are hit by fires. The average cost for removing debris is $46,000 per house, rising to $68,000 if asbestos is found, IAG estimated.

<START>Recent wet weather does not mean this season's fire risks have been eliminated. "It may have been headed off, but it's still there," [Unknown1|Mr Leplastrier] said.

Meanwhile, the report by former firefighters said tackling long-term threats required greater transparency to identify what worked and didn't during major events.

The dozen, boasting a combined 400-plus years in roles at the NSW Parks and Wildlife Service and as volunteers in the Rural Fire Service, said Australia "must do better in managing increasingly dangerous bushfires" as the climate warms and dries.

Ian Brown, one of the members of the Independent Bushfire Group responsible for the 179-page report, said many issues "were not getting talked about," even at the bushfire Royal Commission.

These include the general lack of research into the most effective ways to suppress a fire, how agencies decide which blazes get priority, the poor performance of fire-behaviour models, and the absence of objective post-fire analysis.

"Things are getting worse and we need to review what we're doing," said Mr Brown, who has helped fight more than 100 bushfires.

The report comes as the Berejiklian government prepares to release the results of the NSW Bushfire Inquiry report, possibly within days.

That report, by former deputy NSW Police commissioner Dave Owens and the chair of the Independent Planning Commission Mary O'Kane, is expected to detail the increasing bushfire risks from climate change and the efficacy of prescribed burning to moderate those threats.

Loading

Mr Brown's group said more planned burns to reduce fuel loads may actually exacerbate fire risks.

For instance, burning usually moist forests when conditions permit can alter their species mix, making them more fire prone while reducing natural fire breaks in the landscape.

"Analysis of vegetation across the landscape shows that the North Coast region has only 33 per cent of 'treatable' vegetation [or planned burns]," the report said. For the Sydney Basin, the share is about two-thirds, and just under half for the South Coast and Tablelands.

At least 20 homes were destroyed when the Mt Wilson backburn got away. A new report says specialist training is needed for teams conducting such potentially high-risk operations during the bushfire season.

Credit:Nick Moir

The group also took aim at the so-called "after action reviews," typically conducted by the RFS.

"There is no public reporting, independent expert advice, objective research or outside oversight," the report said. "Fire controllers report on fires they themselves have managed."

Unlike for similar government functions such as the police and the military, the RFS "is both the lead agency and also the chief reporter to government on outcomes," it said.

When Owen Wilson attempted suicide in late August, his ex-girlfriend Kate Hudson had just appeared in a serious of flirty photographs with her new beau, Dax Shepard.

Hudson has since broken up with Shepard, and folks close to the actress say its because she thinks there might be a chance to reunite with Wilson. "She's had time to think about things," a source close to the actress says.

Since just about anything is possible when it comes to [Q11975|Britney Spears] and [Q215497|Kevin Federline], it didn't appear entirely out of the realm of possibility that [Q215497|K-Fed] could be making an appearance on "[Q694106|Oprah]," as was reported [DATETIME|Monday].

"Not true," says [DESC:Unknown2|[Q215497|Federline]'s rep], setting the record straight shortly after the news broke.

What's Federline up to? For starters, he is not working on a follow-up album to "Playing With Fire." Recently he filmed a guest spot on the CW's "One Tree Hill." According to his rep, the air date for that episode has not yet been announced.

Durham police believe Cummings probably did break lockdown rules

Durham police believe Dominic Cummings probably did break lockdown rules following an investigation into his travels around north-east England during lockdown, the Guardian understands.

On Thursday the force released a report saying the prime minister's special adviser "might have" breached health protection regulations when he embarked on a 52-mile round trip to the town of Barnard Castle with his wife and son on her birthday.

<START>[Q384593|Officers] might have intervened to send [COREF:Q24572712|him] home had [COREF:Q384593|they] caught [COREF:Q24572712|him] on the trip on [DATETIME|12 April], or fined [COREF:Q24572712|him] if [COREF:Q24572712|he] refused, the [Q10870555|report] said.

[COREF:Q24572712|His] [QUANTITY|260]-mile journey to [Q179815|Durham] on [DATETIME|27 March] did not break health protection regulations, the [Q10870555|report] concluded, though [COREF:Q10870555|it] made no finding in relation to "stay at home" government guidance.

[Q24572712|Cummings] has denied any wrongdoing and said the journey on [DATETIME|12 April], [Q1512337|Easter Sunday], was to test [COREF:Cummings|his] eyesight. The [Q14211|prime minister] and [Q112014|cabinet] continued to stand by [COREF:Cummings|him] on [DATETIME|Thursday].<END>

As part of their inquiry, detectives examined the aide's press conference on Monday, where he repeatedly said that he had done nothing wrong, and concluded he probably did.

Police stopped short of a definitive declaration of rule-breaking because lockdown regulations had not been tested in the courts, sources with knowledge of the force's thinking told the Guardian. They were keen not to appear to act as "judge and jury," it is understood.

Cardiff 0-2 Newcastle: Match report

A week in which Newcastle United had experienced the highs of Premier League promotion and the lows of a HMRC raid ended with a win in Wales last night.

Newcastle's stars have had an unusual five days, to say the least, but they did their job in Cardiff with two super second-half strikes from Christian Atsu and Isaac Hayden.

It means there is still an outside chance of Newcastle claiming the Championship title if Brighton blink. It is unlikely but Rafa Benitez believes it can be done.

"You never know," said Benitez, who will not watch Brighton's game against Bristol City today. "We did our job. We can do nothing now. It's depending on them. We have to wait.

"Maybe someone will call me (after the Brighton match) and say, "They did this, they did that." Fine. No problem."

A win for Brighton at the Amex Stadium today would confirm them as champions and all Newcastle could do was put pressure on their opponents. They did so, despite the distractions of this week.


Newcastle: Elliot, Clark, Dummett, Mbemba, Yedlin, Colback (Shelvey 73), Hayden, Diame, Perez (Sterry 90), Atsu, Murphy (Mitrovic 66)

Goalscorers: Atsu 55, Hayden 65

Cardiff: McGregor, Bennett, Morrison, Ecuele Manga, Richards, Whittingham (Pilkington 64), Halford (Ralls 64), Gunnarsson, Harris (Noone 24), Zohore, Hoilett

Bookings: Richards

The players" preparations for this trip to Cardiff were not helped by the sight of officers searching their training ground in Benton on Wednesday.

That followed the news that Newcastle managing director Lee Charnley had been arrested at his home at 6am, before later being released without charge.

Charnley usually attends Newcastle matches but was absent at the Cardiff City Stadium. Had he been here, he would have seen Benitez's squad put on a professional performance.

Asked about this week, Benitez said: "The reaction of the players, especially after the promotion on Monday, we gave them Tuesday off, and it's always more difficult to control what they do.

"During the week they were training well. I think they were quite focussed."

More than 4,000 away fans made the 600-mile round-trip to Cardiff. They refused to allow a HMRC raid to ruin their promotion party and so did the players.

It was Cardiff who looked the likelier to open the scoring in the first half, however.

They thought they had in the 20th minute, when Sean Morrison headed home Peter Whittingham's corner. Referee Graham Scott spotted an infringement, however, and ruled it out.

It left Neil Warnock unhappy as the Cardiff boss took aim at PGMOL chief Mike Riley as well as Scott.

"I thought he was very, very poor in general," Warnock said. "His positioning and interpretation.

" (Aleksandar) Mitrovic comes on, never looks at the ball three times, he looks at Morrison, it's a foul every time and he never sees it.

<START>"Why? Because [COREF:Q20641449|he]'s not educated. It's no wonder if [Q562522|Mike Riley] is [COREF:Q20641449|his] [Q901222|tutor]. It's no wonder."

[Q18716|Newcastle] started the [QUANTITY|second] half on top and a free-kick from [QUANTITY|20] yards gave [Q919182|Atsu] the perfect opportunity to make [COREF:Q919182|his] mark. [COREF:Q919182|He] did so.

With a fine finish, [Q919182|Atsu] put the ball over the wall and beyond [Q706218|McGregor], who did not attempt to dive. "[Unknown1|The Mags are going up]," was the song from [Q18716|Newcastle]'s [Q193432|supporters].<END>

Soon after, it was 2-0. A fine strike by Hayden from 25 yards saw him smash the ball into the bottom corner, and that was that.

Getting back to business on the pitch was what Newcastle needed after a tumultuous week off it and the players did not let Benitez down. Now, they need Bristol City do them a favour at Brighton today.

Hayden's goal was Newcastle's second in ten minutes and put the Friday night game to bed

The Joy of Regrowing My Scallions - Yes, Regrowing My Scallions

You'll have to trust me. It's more thrilling than it sounds.


One night, after making this terrifically simple Melissa Clark ginger-scallion chicken dish for dinner, I eyed the leftover hairy scallion butts, laying discarded near the cutting board. On a whim, I arranged them roots-down in a jelly jar with a little bit of water. By the next morning, they were happily back on their way, a tender, alive thing, stretching toward the light.

Since then, checking on my scallions has become my favorite daily activity, the way taking a walk to get a coffee or picking up the mail used to be. I grew up in Virginia, helping out in my mother's garden, and I know that we can regrow most of our everyday food: potatoes, ginger, celery, even carrot tops. Usually, it's not terribly helpful knowledge in my Brooklyn kitchen, with each precious foot of counter space already overcrowded and accounted for.

But there's nothing like a viral pandemic to inspire resourcefulness, especially when food feels so expensive and each trip to the store is laden with anxiety and fear. The Covid-19 crisis is asking us to reconsider so many things: Our relationship to wellness, our priorities, our values. Everything suddenly feels precious, and nothing should be wasted - time, energy, even food scraps. Maximizing every resource we have feels productive and reassuring, when little else does. It's free comfort, and we shouldn't squander that, either.

The green of my second-generation scallions is fainter somehow, and they taste gentler, too. They're easier on the palette and my stressed-out stomach. The milky shoots remind me of a line from the poem "Sorrow Is Not My Name," by Ross Gay, that reads: "My color's green. I'm spring."

<START>[Q1312|Spring], the season of renewal, is on hold. And for now, [Q1313|summer] is too. Outside [COREF:Q24851866|my] home, there is little to no certainty. But [COREF:Q24851866|my] [Q27938|scallions]? Each day, [COREF:Q27938|they] rebound a little more, oblivious to anything else but growth.

Thai king strips consort of titles for 'disloyalty'

Image copyright EPA Image caption Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi, pictured here piloting a fighter jet, was appointed the king's royal consort in July

Thailand's King Vajiralongkorn has stripped his royal consort of her rank and titles for "misbehaviour and disloyalty against the monarch."

An official announcement said Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi had been "ambitious" and tried to "elevate herself to the same state as the queen."

"The royal consort's behaviours were considered disrespectful," it said.

She was appointed in July, just two months after the king married Queen Suthida, his fourth wife.

Sineenat, who was a major-general and is a trained pilot, nurse and bodyguard, was the first person to be awarded the title of Royal Noble Consort in nearly a century.

Queen Suthida - a 41-year-old former flight attendant and deputy head of his bodyguard unit - is King Vajiralongkorn's long-term partner and has been seen with him in public for many years.

The announcement that Sineenat had been stripped of her titles was published in the Royal Gazette on Monday. It marked a sudden fall from grace for the royal consort, who for several years was seen often at the side of King Vajiralongkorn.

Even after the king's marriage to Queen Suthida, Sineenart was a regular guest at royal events.

What did the palace say?

The statement published on Monday said Sineenat had "shown resistance and pressure in every manner to stop the appointment of the Queen" ahead of the coronation in May.

"The king gave her a royal consort position, in hopes of relieving the pressure and a problem that could affect the monarchy," the statement said.

It also accused the royal consort of "resistance against the king and the queen" and of abusing her power to give orders on the king's behalf.

The king, the statement said, had learnt "she neither was grateful to the title bestowed upon her, nor did she behave appropriately according to her status."

<START>[COREF:Q548733|He] ordered [COREF:Q61117470|her] stripped of all royal titles, decorations, status in the [Q4926855|royal guard] and [COREF:Q61117470|her] military ranks.

[Q548733|King Vajiralongkorn] ascended the throne after the death of [DESC:Q855252|[COREF:Q548733|his] father] in [DATETIME|2016].

What about the king's wives?

He has had four wives - Princess Soamsawali from 1977 to 1993; Yuvadhida Polpraserth from 1994 to 1996; Srirasmi Suwadee between 2001 and 2014; and Queen Suthida.

The true cause of Sineenart's removal as royal consort may never be made public, given the secrecy which cloaks palace affairs in Thailand. The nation's lese-majeste law forbids any insult of the monarchy and is among the strictest in the world.

The removal of Sineenat echoes the cases of two of the King's former wives. In 1996, he denounced his second wife, who fled to the United States, and disowned four sons he had with her.

In 2014, his third wife Srirasmi Suwadee was similarly stripped of all her titles and banished from court. Her 14-year-old son has been raised by King Vajiralongkorn in Germany and Switzerland.

The King has also exercised his royal powers in a more direct way than his recent predecessors. Earlier this month, the two most important army units in the capital, Bangkok were placed directly under his command - a concentration of military power in royal hands unprecedented in modern Thailand.

Earth's temperature to dip but still sizzle in 2017

OSLO World temperatures are likely to dip next year from a sizzling record high in 2016, when man-made global warming was slightly boosted by a natural El Nino event in the Pacific Ocean, scientists said on Tuesday.

It is still likely to be the third warmest since records began.

<START>The year-on-year decline will coincide with the [QUANTITY|first] year of [Q22686|Donald Trump]'s presidency. [COREF:Q22686|He] has sometimes dismissed as a hoax the idea that [Q7942|global warming] is caused by human activity.

"[DATETIME|Next year] is not likely to be a record but [COREF:DATETIME|it] will still be a very warm year," [Q21716366|[Q10639464|[Q121594|Professor]] [Q21716366|Adam Scaife]] of the [Q1851405|British Met Office] told [Q130879|Reuters] of a [Q10870555|report] on [DATETIME|Tuesday] based on new computer data.

[COREF:Q21716366|He] said it would be wrong for anyone who doubts that [Q7942|climate change] is caused by humans to interpret the expected [DATETIME|2017] dip, prompted by the end of El Nino, which released heat from the [Q98|Pacific Ocean], as a sign of an end to the long-term trend of [Q7942|global warming].<END>

The Met Office projected that 2017 was likely to be the third warmest year since records began in the mid-19th century, behind 2016 and 2015.

Among signs of warming, sea ice in both the Arctic Ocean and around Antarctica is at record lows, according to mid-December data by the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center.

Global average temperatures for 2017 would be about 0.75 degree Celsius (1.35 Fahrenheit) above the long-term 1961-1990 average of 14.0 C (57.2 F), the Met Office said.

This year is so far 0.86 C (1.55 F) above average, matching a forecast made in 2016, Scaife said. El Nino accounted for about 0.2 C (0.36 F) of the warming in 2016, far less than the extra heat from human-generated greenhouse gases.

Separately, the Geneva-based World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said 2016 was on track to be the warmest on record, ahead of 2015, with data from November confirming projections issued a month ago.

"2016 has been remarkable for all the wrong reasons," WMO spokeswoman Clare Nullis said of the heat.

The WMO says the build-up of human-created greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is causing ever more harmful heatwaves, droughts, floods and a rise in global sea levels of about 20 cm (7.87 inches) in the past century.

El Ninos happen every few years and can disrupt weather worldwide. After a powerful El Nino in 1998, it took until 2005 for a year to match that year's record heat.

Review of The Divide on WeTV

Marin Ireland in The Divide. WE

<START>It's generally a good thing for a new series to introduce itself with a clear, simple title, but in the case of [Q15072810|The Divide], the [QUANTITY|first] scripted [Q130232|[Q21010853|drama]] from [Q7949152|WeTV], the title makes it seem much more simple than it is. The [QUANTITY|eight]-episode [Q643873|legal drama] is, in brief, about a controversial effort to reopen the death-penalty convictions of [QUANTITY|two] [Q235155|white] [Q1862087|prisoners] in the murder of a [Q817393|black] family. You might assume, then, that [COREF:Q15072810|the [NO_COREF_ALT:Q5398426|show]] is about a single, sharp, unambiguous divide between [Q49078|white Americans] and [Q49085|black Americans] in the justice system-the [Q643873|law-drama] equivalent of [Q188000|[Q1797743|Crash]].

But to [COREF:Q15072810|its] credit, and like the case it begins to explore in [COREF:Q15072810|its] [QUANTITY|two]-hour premiere [DATETIME|Wednesday] night, [Q15072810|The Divide] is much more complicated than it seems. Yes, there is a racial divide at the center of [COREF:Q15072810|the [NO_COREF_ALT:Q5398426|show]]: [Unknown1|Christine Rosa] ([Q72749|Marin Ireland]), an [Q15253558|advocate] for a [Q1345|Philadelphia] group based on the [Q1664111|Innocence Project], and most of [COREF:Unknown1|her] colleagues working to overturn what they believe to be wrongful convictions, are [Q235155|white]. [Q653368|District attorney] [Unknown2|Adam Page] ([Q21964824|Damon Gupton]), [DESC:Unknown3|[COREF:Unknown2|his] [Q2101758|police-commissioner] father] ([Q1095834|Clarke Peters]) and [DESC:Unknown4|the surviving daughter of the victims] are [Q817393|black].

As the case unfolds, however, it becomes clear that neither side of this (purposely unsettled) case has a monopoly on righteousness or ethical conflict. [Unknown1|Christine] and [Unknown2|Adam] are each driven, if to different ends, and each is vulnerable to being blinded by their determination and external motivations. ([COREF:Unknown2|He]'s politically ambitious; [DESC:Unknown5|[COREF:Unknown1|her] father] is in jail for a crime [COREF:Unknown1|she] knows [COREF:Unknown5|he]'s innocent of because [COREF:Unknown1|she] was with [COREF:Unknown5|him] when it happened.)<END>

The divides that emerge in this series are not simply between two races but between prosecution and defense, between the desire for justice and for resolution. In the two-hour premiere, we get to see multiple sides of each character, including the inmates-who, the script suggests, may be innocent, may be guilty, may be innocent of this crime yet bad people in other ways. There's a remarkable scene between one convict (Chris Bauer) and his mother (Ann Dowd) before his scheduled last meal, for which he requested a brand of hot dogs he used to hate when she served them when he was a kid-it packs a while life's history of mutual blame and sorrow into a few brief minutes.

There's a certain amount of melodrama in the premiere (which is all that was previewed for critics), but the beginning fits a fair amount of nuance into a package that could have been a soapbox. Ireland in particular gives Christine fine shading, and the way that race plays into the story-and into Adam's career ambitions-feels more natural than engineered. The Divide provides a good head start on a fall network season that's unusually diverse in its casting; if The Divide continues the way it started, it will set an example of how to tell stories of black and white (and brown, and yellow...) in shades of gray.

Coronavirus UK: R rate rises as 100,000 infected and Leeds and London face new restrictions

The reproduction R rate of Covid-19 infections in the UK has risen to 1.2-1.5 as cases jumped by 60 per cent in a week.

More than 100,000 people are now estimated to have the virus in England.

London was placed onto the government's coronavirus watchlist on Friday as mayor Sadiq Khan warned the capital was at a "tipping point" while Leeds was expected to face new restrictions from midnight on Friday.

No area of England can be considered "low risk," according to the Department for Health and Social Care after the long-delayed launch of the NHS Test and Trace App.

In Wales, the government announced Cardiff, Swansea and Llanelli were to go into lockdown from Sunday. The new restrictions will cover around 1.5 million people, nearly half the country's population. Wales's health minister Vaughan Gething urged people not to have a "big blowout" ahead of the introduction of the new restrictions.

Meanwhile, the UK's largest supermarket chain began rationing key items in an effort to prevent a return to shortages seen during the early stage of the pandemic.

Tesco has introduced a three-item per customer limit on flour, dried pasta, toilet roll, baby wipes and anti-bacterial wipes, a measure the supermarket chain said was to "ensure everyone can keep buying what they need." Morrisons had introduced similar rationing measures on Thursday.

A new phase three trial for a vaccine was launched by US biotech company Novavax, the second trial to reach phase three in the UK.

Ten thousand people will be invited to take part in the new phase at locations including London, Glasgow, Belfast and Greater Manchester.

Kremlin warns of conflict if Georgia joins NATO

Aug. 6 (UPI) -- The accession to NATO for Georgia, which hosts one of the world's largest oil pipelines, could lead to regional crises, the Russian prime minister said Monday.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg hosted Georgian Prime Minister Mamuka Bakhtadze in Brussels in July following a summit where all 29 members of the alliance backed Georgia's bid to join NATO.

<START>[Q842386|Russian Prime Minister] [Q23530|Dmitry Medvedev] was quoted by [Q159|Russian] news agency [Q223799|Tass] as saying the accession of [Q230|Georgia], a former [Q15180|Soviet] republic, could trigger a "terrible conflict."

[Q230|Georgia] lacks any substantial domestic [Q22656|oil] or [Q40858|gas] reserves, but sits along the primary transit point for [Q22656|oil] from the [Q5484|Caspian Sea] and [Q27275|Central Asia] to [Q46|Europe] through the [QUANTITY|1,099]-mile [Q339546|Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline].

For natural gas, the first phase of deliveries from the Shah Deniz field off the coast of Azerbaijan, heralded as BP's largest gas discovery when it was announced in 1999, moved through Georgia and Turkey in 2006. The second phase will push gas through a network of pipelines dubbed the Southern Gas Corridor deep into southern Europe.

Europe gets about a quarter of its gas needs met by Russia, though most of that runs through the Soviet-era transit network in Ukraine, where geopolitical conflicts present a risk to energy security. The broader Southern Corridor is in a race against plans by Russian energy company Gazprom to twin the Nord Stream gas pipeline through the Baltic Sea to Germany.

updated 12:08 p.m. ET April 16, 2008

ATSUGI, Japan - Planning for your old age? Designers in Japan are.

Carmaker Nissan Motor is using a specialized driver's suit and goggles to simulate the bad balance, stiff joints, weaker eyesight and extra 11lbs that may accompany senior citizenry.

Associate chief designer Etsuhiro Watanabe says the suit's weight and constriction help in determining functionality and accessibility within cars by putting young designers not only in the minds of the mobility-challenged, but also in their bodies.

"Difficulty in walking, back pains, trouble in lifting arms - we wanted to consider assorted infirmities," said Watanabe of the concept known as universal design.

"It's easy to do this for the young, but we wanted to design for adverse conditions and see what modifications are needed."

An ageing suit was first used by Nissan a decade ago, while Japanese washlet maker Toto uses such suits to simulate bathroom mobility, even including tub water as part of the program.

Launched in a rapidly graying nation where over 40 percent of the population is expected to be over 65 age by mid-century, the design strategy also aims to find traction abroad.

Over 40 percent of Nissan's Japanese and U.S. sales are to customers over 50 years old, according to the company.

Nissan says the suit and glasses help decide dashboard angles and visibility issues, as well as driver space and support.

"It's very difficult to drive, says Nissan's Naoki Yamamoto after a turn at the wheel in a suit that runs from neck to feet.

"You lose the freedom you're accustomed to, and while you can move, there are limitations, such as turning the steering wheel or switching on the blinker."

Universal design is not just for the elderly, as larger drivers with space and mobility concerns also look for greater access and share of the road.

They say you can play football in all weather but that's not exactly true, is it? A waterlogged Suncorp Stadium turned into a giant kiddy pool during the second half of the Brisbane Roar-Wellington Phoenix match. True, Matt McKay and the Brisbane Roar players, plus coach Frans Thijssen, wanted to play on and who could blame them? With 15 minutes plus stoppage time still to go, they sensed an equaliser. Brisbane desperately needed points to keep pace with Melbourne City in the race for sixth spot and were fuming at being denied. However, it was clearly unsafe for players and images shown 30 minutes later showed the ground had become almost wholly submerged.

<START>2. More kids please, Popa

[COREF:Unknown1|I]'m probably in the minority here but [COREF:Unknown1|I] was pleased to see so many youngsters getting their chance for the [Q999035|Western Sydney Wanderers] on [DATETIME|Saturday]. [COREF:Q999035|They] were overwhelmed by [Q732929|Newcastle] but these next few weeks marks a great chance for [Q361247|Tony Popovic] to blood so many young [Q937857|players] on the big stage. Very few [Q628099|managers] ever get that luxury but the well-documented fixture troubles mean [COREF:Q361247|he] can expose some big talents to the senior tier and see if they're up to it. Besides, if any team needs to find some hidden gems before next season, it's the [Q999035|Wanderers].

3. Glory close but deeper flaws are being exposed

It all depends on whether your glass is half-empty or half-full - either Perth Glory are getting their slump out of the way at the right time or they've hit the wall. And you might feel the Glory were stiff to have conceded an injury-time equaliser against Central Coast but they were perhaps fortunate to have led given the hosts had the better of the day. The good news for the Glory is that they've got the best run home of the "big five," starting with matches against Western Sydney and Newcastle. They then host Sydney FC and Melbourne City on home soil and finish with the Wanderers away. If they can't find form in that stretch, they don't deserve to be there.

4. Class factor matters

This may not go down with Melbourne Victory fans but Gui Finkler seems off his game. The Brazilian was buzzing around earlier in the year like a man possessed, relishing being given the reins as the team's leading attacking midfielder. However, he's lost his way somewhat in terms of setting up the play around him. That said, it was his pass that led to Archie Thompson's equaliser, which shows his touch hasn't completely deserted him. Aaron Mooy also had a surprisingly quiet night on Friday but it was his vision which set James Brown away for the winner. Moral of the story? Never discount individual brilliance (just ask anyone who tried to stop Nathan Burns).

5. Where the bloody hell are you?

Just 11,638 turned out to see Sydney FC try to go to the top of the table on Friday. Then we're down to 10,000 at Wanderland on Saturday and only 5000 at Gosford on Sunday. They barely managed to tick into five figures in Brisbane (although they had a good reason in hindsight). There's so many excuses being bandied about it's hard to keep pace. Is going to the game a bit too hard these days? Kudos to the fans in Adelaide, however. Their primal hatred of Victorians knows no bounds and over 16,000 saw Hindmarsh packed with passion. A small army of 1200 marched across from Melbourne, helping create one of the fiercest atmospheres we've seen this season.

Modest Rise in Consumer Spending in February

WASHINGTON (AP) - Consumers spent modestly last month, a sign that the economic recovery is proceeding at a decent - but not spectacular - pace.

The government said Monday that consumers increased their spending 0.3 percent in February, a tad slower than the 0.4 percent increase in January. Still, the increase was considered a respectable showing, especially given the snowstorms that slammed the East Coast.

Americans" incomes, however, were flat.

Incomes were flat in February, following a 0.3 percent gain in January. It marked the weakest showing since July, when incomes actually shrank. Income growth is the fuel for future spending. February's flat-line reading suggests shoppers will be cautious in the months ahead.

Spending growth in February matched economists" expectations. The reading on income was a bit weaker than forecast.

Both the spending and income figures in Monday's report point to a modest economic recovery.

Many analysts predict the economy slowed in the first three months after logging a big growth spurt at the end of 2009.

<START>The economy will expand at a [QUANTITY|2.5] percent to [QUANTITY|3] percent pace in the [QUANTITY|first] quarter, [Q485178|analysts] predict. That is roughly half the [QUANTITY|5.6] percent pace seen in the final quarter of [DATETIME|last year].

Unlike past recoveries, where [Q22855|consumer] spending led the way, this one is hinging more on the spending of businesses and foreigners.

High unemployment, sluggish wage gains, hard-to-get credit and record-high home foreclosures are all expected to keep [Q22855|consumers] relatively cautious - [QUANTITY|one] of the main reasons why the pace of the recovery will be more subdued than in the past.<END>

With spending outpacing income growth, Americans" savings dipped in February.

Americans saved 3.1 percent of their disposable income, down from 3.4 percent in January. It was the lowest reading on the savings rate since October 2008.

Government policies aimed at encouraging growth of Imax and 3-D movies are helping boost the format's popularity in China's tightly controlled film market.

"Transformers: Age of Extinction," the latest instalment of Michael Bay's blockbuster robot film franchise, earned nearly $10 million at Chinese Imax screens on its opening weekend, more than double the previous record, the company said.

The deal comes a year after Imax partnered with another Chinese company, Wanda Cinema, to open up to 120 of the Canadian company's theatres.

At the end of 2013, Imax had 173 cinemas in China and plans for 230 more by 2021, according to its latest annual report.

That puts China on track to become Imax's No. 1 market globally, overtaking the United States, where box office revenue growth is stagnating and the company has about 380 cinemas.

Amber Rose looks terrified of being first eliminated from DWTS

She is normally the epitome of confidence and stoic resilience.

But Amber Rose couldn't keep her emotions in check when she was saved from being the first contestant eliminated from Dancing With The Stars on Tuesday night.

The 32-year-old looked tense before covering her face with her hands in relief.

She had looked in terror of being eliminated after getting a score of 24/40 from the judges for a Game of Thrones inspired Viennese Waltz on Monday.

The mother-of-one nearly broke down when she was also told she was safe - got a big hug from Maksim Chmerkovskiy, 36, who had shaved his usual beard for the occasion.

Asked if she thought her scores from the judges would be enough to keep her safe, she said: "I don't know if they're enough or not. I just know that I don't want to go home."

Earlier, she had said she hoped the show would help correct the public image of her, saying: "I wanted to come on Dancing With The Stars to show people exactly who I am. And just prove to my son that I can be Super Muva."

Amber and Maksim dressed as Khaleesi and Khal Drogo for their dramatic dance number on Monday, with Amber sporting a platinum blond wig covering her signature shaven head.

Receiving a disappointing field of sixes from the judges, host Tom Bergeron admitted: 'I was surprised they didn't go a little higher.'

Fijian British army veterans in high court battle to remain in UK

Eight Fiji-born soldiers who served with the British army in Iraq and Afghanistan have gone to the high court to try to overturn what they say were bureaucratic errors that have left them as illegal immigrants in the country they once served.

They include Remesio "Pat" Waqaliva, 42, who was suddenly discharged from the army in 2009 after nine years, including two tours of Iraq, and not advised that he had to immediately apply for the UK citizenship to which he was legally entitled.

Waqaliva, who was married and has four children, discovered subsequently that he was unable to work and has had to rely on handouts to survive. Without an income, he says, he has been unable to save up the £2,389 plus lawyer's fees for a visa.

"I didn't have any time to prepare myself," Waqaliva said in his first interview. "I wasn't told that my UK visa would expire when I left the army. Once I did realise, I just didn't have the money. It's not just the £2,000, it's that I would have to hire a solicitor as well."

The British army recruits actively from Fiji. Recruits from the Pacific nation currently number about 1,300, and they are often noted for their commitment and bravery.

Those who serve more than four years without serious blemish are entitled to live and work in the UK, but most of the veterans had assumed the process was automatic and have struggled with the paperwork as well as the fees involved.

Instead they have found themselves unable to resolve their immigration status. Some returned to their native country but a group has come together to seek a judicial review of the handling of their cases in a crowdfunded action.

Others in the group include Taitusi Ratucaucau, who is recovering from an operation to remove a brain tumour that could cost him £50,000 if he loses the case.

<START>[Unknown1|Waqaliva] was discharged after [COREF:Unknown1|he] had nearly completed a short period at the [Unknown2|army correction centre] in [Q184163|Colchester] because [COREF:Unknown1|he] had overstayed [COREF:Unknown1|his] leave. [COREF:Unknown1|He] said [COREF:Unknown1|he] had family problems, which [COREF:Unknown1|he] was trying to fix, and thought having served [COREF:Unknown1|his] penalty that would be the end of the matter.

But [Unknown1|Waqaliva] was surprised to discover [COREF:Unknown1|he] had been told to leave [COREF:Q222595|the army] with [QUANTITY|one] week's notice. Family friends said the only money [COREF:Unknown1|he] was given was for a train ticket from [Q184163|Colchester] to [Q25|Wales], where [COREF:Unknown1|his] family were.

[COREF:Unknown1|The [NO_COREF_ALT:Q193891|veteran]] served with the [Q4630663|20th Armoured Brigade], and undertook tours of [Q796|Iraq] in [DATETIME|2006], and again just before [COREF:Unknown1|he] was discharged. The [QUANTITY|first] tour was particularly dangerous: "Every day you got out of the camp, you wouldn't know if you would come back alive."<END>

Waqaliva said he hoped the legal hearing, which begins on Tuesday, would help get his immigration status resolved. "I think the first thing is to get a visa. That would put everything to rest, the stress the worry."

Ministers have allowed several hundred Afghan interpreters who worked with the British in Helmand province to relocate to the UK. The scheme initially let in 450 but was recently expanded to allow in a further 100 at risk of reprisals from the Taliban.

A government spokesperson said: "The Home Office and Ministry of Defence work closely with our foreign and Commonwealth recruits to make sure they are fully aware of how they and their families can settle in the UK, and the costs involved."

The La La Land producers behaved with uncommon good grace in handing over the statuettes to Moonlight producers Adele Romanski and Jeremy Kleiner.

I bumped into Hal Luftig in New York. He was one of the lead producers of the musical Kinky Boots and he told me that if he'd been in a similar situation he wouldn't have given up the statuette. "They'd have had to wrestle me to the ground to get my Olivier or Tony," he said. And he was not joking.

"In future, at these awards shows, they'll have to give out confirmation cards that we flash to an audience so there's no misunderstanding," Luftig added.

Well, that's what he said. But in the moment, I think something else kicks in. A sense of honour, one would hope.

Look, it's just showbusiness! But I bet more people now know about, and will go to see, Moonlight than if it had been a "regular" win.

And I hope folk who have dissed La La Land will go back and see it again, too. There's more to it than meets the eye; and Emma Stone deserved her win.

How many of the eight properties in our quiz can you get right?

Featured properties include ones in Turkey, Spain and the Maldives

Values go from around £200,000 for a flat to almost £100million for a house

By Myra Butterworth For MailOnline


As winter approaches and the cold weather sets in, most Britons begin pining for their summer holidays.

Buying a holiday home in your favourite destination could not only prove the ultimate antidote to the British winter but may also prove a sound investment.

We've selected a handful of overseas properties that could be the answer to your holiday home dreams - ranging from an exclusive 12-bedroom home in America's California to a much cheaper one-bedroom flat closer to home in Spain's Andalusia.

But a word of caution: If you do decide to take the plunge with an overseas purchase, you'll need to do your research first to avoid some of the more common pitfalls.

Overseas property expert Simon Conn explains there are various factors to consider when buying a holiday home.

He said: 'If you're looking to rent the property while you're not using it, make you consider the market you're targeting. For example, do you need to be near a beach for families.'

And he added: 'The downside of buying on the coast is that it is going to be more expensive, you could pay a third of the price a few miles inland. So it is worth taking a look at different areas.'

Buying agent Henry Pryor suggests that having a place abroad ahead of Brexit may prove a shrewd investment.

But he also adds a warning, saying: 'Historically places at the end of a Ryanair route have proved popular and lucrative investment areas - Perugia in Italy for example and similar secondary airports in Greece and Montenegro have similar appeal but be wary that post Brexit the airline routes may shift so don't bet the house on one carrier.

'Remember that if you plan to rent out your property then guests demand top services but if you provide them the evidence suggests that they will pay for them.

'Don't cut corners, keep some authenticity and make sure that your a accommodation is flexible - works for families with babies, house parties and increasingly importantly for silver stayers who have time and money for the best places.'

And finally he added: 'Above all, buy something you want to use. After all, if it doesn't let and you can't sell it then you may end up living in it.'

**** ARTICLE #93: 20170817 - Army Redundancies: Will it be the brightest and best who volunteer? (None) *****
Army Redundancies: Will it be the brightest and best who volunteer?

By Allan Mallinson for the Daily Mail


I can still remember an undergraduate lecture by that fine economic historian Duncan Bythell, who could out-Bowra Bowra himself in Wadham waspishness, in which he quoted Harold Macmillan on his time with the Grenadiers in the Great War: "There were many in the regiment who were killed on the Western Front who would have made better Prime Ministers than I;' - dramatic pause, and then Bythell added 'He was probably right."

In ten years" time there may be a Chief of the General Staff who says "there were many in the army who took redundancy in 2012 who would have made a better CGS than I."

And there may be many who will say, "he is probably right."

Except that staying power is itself a quality of command that should not be underestimated. Atlee, when Prime Minister, chose to recall Bill Slim from retirement to be CIGS because he was not convinced by the names put before him by Montgomery, the outgoing chief.

Atlee, himself a former infantry major, said he admired Slim, who had commanded the XIV Army - "the Forgotten Army" - in Burma, because "he makes do with the scrapings of the barrel."

The focus in the army redundancies, perhaps inevitably, on the example of Brigadier Nicky Moffat is misplaced. At 50, and as an officer in the Adjutant-General's Corps, her future would have been limited (a brigadier is guaranteed only one job). She had done well to get where she had - not because she was a women, but because it is difficult for officers in the administrative and support services to compete with those in the combat arms when it comes to promotion boards. At her age, a fine second career will be available, and I suspect that she made a pragmatic calculation.

<START>Lucky the enterprise that snaps [COREF:Q27942164|her] up.

The name that really does disturb [COREF:Q4730822|me], however (and there may be others, for no lists are being published), is that of [Q104708740|[Q4967182|Brigadier] [Q104708740|Justin Maciejewski]], who is much younger. Talk to [COREF:Q104708740|him] for [QUANTITY|five] minutes and you will recognise a future [Q1568142|CGS]. Talk to [COREF:Q104708740|his] superiors for [QUANTITY|two] minutes and you will be in no doubt.

Besides coming from a fine military family - the [Unknown1|Maciejewskis] fought [Q855|Stalin]'s armies and the [Q7318|Nazis] - [COREF:Q104708740|he] was a star at [Q575618|Sandhurst] and [Q35794|Cambridge], and later at the [Q6269376|Staff College], and as a young [Q189290|officer] was well-schooled in the thoughtful, no-nonsense infantry way of the [Unknown2|Greenjackets]. Like [Unknown3|[Q2703373|Field Marshal] [Unknown3|Dwin Bramall]].<END>

He won a fine DSO in Iraq in command of his battalion, was then promoted early to be chief of staff of the 3rd Infantry Division, then promoted to be a brigade commander, following which he was made Director of Combat Arms without the usual year at the Royal College of Defence Studies.

In that job he would have been immersed in the planning for the re-shaping of the army after the cuts.

More from Allan Mallinson for the Daily Mail...

In an email to his staff he has made it clear that he is leaving for positive rather than negative reasons.

I do not doubt it.

However, what I do know is that Brigadier Maciejewski's intellect, experience and quality of character will be a huge loss to the Army, and will not easily be replaced - if at all. There are few officers who are so widely admired - let alone liked - as he.

His going will have as much effect in some quarters as the cap-badge cuts to be announced on Thursday.

Twenty years ago, at the time of the "Options for Change" redundancies at the end of the Cold War (when it was fashionable to think that it was also the "End of History"), losses of names such as Brigadier Maciejewski's made few ripples, for the army was still a pretty big organization.

But at 82,000 the army will be, in the opinion of many, below critical mass.

Senior commanders in the army will have their work cut out to steady the boat after Thursday's announcement of which cap-badges will face the axe - which families are to be broken up - and also the drip-feed of redundancy names.

I can only hope that they have done and are doing all in their power to persuade the very brightest and best to stay, rather than just accepting volunteers for redundancy because that plays well politically.

Buenos Aires: Conservative opposition candidate Mauricio Macri took a surprise lead in Argentina's presidential election, almost certainly forcing the ruling party's Daniel Scioli into a run-off vote next month, partial results showed.

Mr Scioli, backed by outgoing leftist president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, had hoped for an outright victory on Sunday.

But with nearly 75 per cent of ballots counted, preliminary results showed Macri, the business-friendly mayor of Buenos Aires, leading with 35.7 per cent of the vote while Scioli had 35.2 per cent.

"What happened today will change politics in this country," Mr Macri said in a speech to supporters, rallying them ahead of an expected November 22 second round of voting.

Mr Scioli could still overtake Mr Macri as the remaining votes come in but the two men are now virtually certain to go to a run-off election next month and Mr Scioli looks vulnerable.

The early results were met by deathly silence at Mr Scioli's headquarters, where minutes before supporters had been celebrating what was expected to be a comfortable lead if not outright victory by the Buenos Aires provincial governor.

"The polls were totally wrong. This is totally unexpected," said political analyst Ignacio Labaqui. "An eventual Scioli victory, which was the consensus forecast, is clearly at stake."

"I'm not surprised that the margin is narrow but I never imagined Macri would be on top," said one stunned Scioli supporter as silence fell over the ruling party's campaign bunker.

Mr Scioli, Buenos Aires governor, drew support from poorer Argentinians who credit Mrs de Kirchner and her late husband and predecessor, Nestor Kirchner, with an expansive welfare system and hauling the economy out of a devastating 2001-2002 depression.

Early polling showed Mr Macri was popular with the middle class and was favoured by foreign investors who are interested in Argentina's vast energy and metal reserves but are deterred by the stifling controls that Mrs de Kirschner has placed on the economy.

Manchester United star Paul Pogba finally has something to shout about

Paul Pogba was back in Jose Mourinho's starting line-up and maintained he has respect for the Manchester United manager after their feuding.

<START>It is a story that has unquestionably harmed [Q18656|United]'s season, with [Q79983|Mourinho] harbouring concerns about an out-of-sorts [Q129027|Pogba] and, more specifically, [COREF:Q129027|his] vociferous agent [Q2014379|Mino Raiola].

'You have to go through these periods to make you stronger. There is no problem with Mourinho. It's not me who picks the team. Ask the coach if you want to know why I play less. I respect his choices.

'It's too early to talk about a departure from United, the situation can change.'

That Pogba addressed potentially leaving Old Trafford at all seemed surprising if there is absolutely no issue with Mourinho, as he stressed.

Even so, it feels inconceivable that the 25-year-old will not be at United next season and against Swansea he showed he is capable of discipline in a midfield two next to Nemanja Matic.

Any praise is laced with mitigation, of course, given the opposition and that Swansea did not offer any sort of attacking threat before half-time. Pogba had all the time he wanted to take balls off his central defenders and get United moving and this was occasionally a stroll. He won't always be afforded that luxury, and there were some stray passes, but you can only play what's in front of you and so this was encouraging.

The simple stuff was executed well. Everything was completed with a little more purpose. That was definitely the case after five minutes, when Pogba screened the midfield to intercept a Swansea clearance. Romelu Lukaku was celebrating his 100th Premier League goal 14 seconds later, thanks to Pogba doing the donkey work.

There were other examples, too, particularly hunting down Sam Clucas to turn Swansea over as the visitors threatened to break. Pogba showed good defensive work at corners and a willingness to break into the box from deep.

He actually looked like one of those dynamic midfielders who can do a bit of everything and are invaluable in this division. The problem is that United expect more from someone who cost £89million, but mastering the basics is a good start for now.

'I think he played like the team,' Mourinho said.

'The team played very well in the first half, he played very well in the first half.

'The team in the second half went a little bit down and Paul also went a little bit down, but he played 90 minutes in Russia and it's normal to go a little bit down with the rest of the players.'

They can't play like this against Manchester City if Mourinho is to stop Pep Guardiola wrapping up the title on Saturday. City will see some of the spaces out wide and believe they can overload United.

Mourinho, whose son Jose Jnr was on the bench with the coaching staff on Saturday, claimed he is not even thinking about that game. 'I think we have 10 more points than last season, something like that,' he added. 'We have more goals scored, we have conceded fewer, we finished sixth, we're going to try to finish second, so the season is not as bad as you try to make it.

'Manchester City is not important for me. Important is that since we left first position and went to second, we stayed there for the whole season.

'We deserved to feel second in spite of what you can say. You all say the third, fourth, fifth, sixth teams are better than us but they are not better than us because we have more points than them.'

That was delivered with Carlos Carvalhal, Mourinho's great mate, sitting alongside him. Swansea were far better after a double substitution at half-time - 'Not many coaches do that,' said Mourinho - and look likely to survive. 'This guy is going to keep Swansea up,' Mourinho added. 'He is the manager of the season because they were dead and he is going to save them.'

That felt an apt description given that one of the colourful Carvalhal's metaphors centred on hospitals and intensive care. Swansea have been discharged and are in the sea now, apparently.

'We are swimming,' Carvalhal said. 'We still need to swim faster. The sharks can push you down.' For Pogba and United, the City sharks are circling.

**** ARTICLE #96: 20150324 - In Italy, Plans for an Easter Blessing Yield a Lawsuit for a Public School (None) *****
In Italy, Plans for an Easter Blessing Yield a Lawsuit for a Public School

BOLOGNA, Italy - The 16 board members of Giosuè Carducci Elementary School took their seats, chatting amicably, until the agenda turned to Easter. The board had already agreed to let a Roman Catholic priest offer a blessing at their public school. Now the questions involved setting the date and whether to hold the prayer in the gym.

And the matter of the lawsuit.

"I am absolutely against this motion," declared Monica Fontanelli, a board member, who accused the majority of trying to pre-empt the Thursday court hearing by setting the blessing for an earlier date. "It is wrong that this board is not waiting for the decision of the administrative court."

Yet others quickly countered that most of the school's students were Catholic, and that the rights of the majority mattered, too. "I support holding it in the garden so that even passers-by get a blessing!" offered one board member, jokingly.

No country in the world is more synonymous with Catholicism than Italy, where the overwhelming majority of the population is baptized as Catholics, and where the pope lives in a city-state surrounded by the heart of Rome.

In Bologna, like so many of Italy's ancient cities, the history and landscape are intertwined with Catholicism. A statue of the city's patron saint, Petronius, rises between the city's two medieval towers. Catholic churches are scattered throughout a city center known for its elegant sidewalks shaded by porticoes.

Yet here, as elsewhere in Italy, Catholicism has long been in retreat. Attendance at Mass has fallen sharply over the decades as many Italians became either nonpracticing or nonbelievers.

The case over the blessing at the school is part of a continuing debate in Italy over where exactly the church-state boundary lies. A similar case arose at the same school years ago when the issue was whether a priest could offer an Easter prayer in a classroom during school hours. A local court prohibited the prayers.

<START>This time, the prayers are voluntary and, while still held on school grounds, timed for shortly after the closing bell of classes. A group of parents and teachers filed a legal action, arguing that the prayers are unconstitutional.

Supporters of the voluntary prayers say they fall within the latitude that [Q38|Italy] allows for the church. [Q38|Italy] is a secular state but has a special treaty with the [Q237|Vatican], which provides that public schools offer an hour of voluntary weekly religious instruction, coordinated by local dioceses.

"The majority of [Q37226|teachers] and [Q48282|students] in public schools are [Q17549077|Catholics]," said the [Unknown1|[Q841594|Rev.] [Unknown1|Vittorio Zoboli]], one of the [Q42603|priests] who made the requests to hold prayers. "So they are happy to have this."<END>

Even as church attendance declines, the influence of the church on politics and public life remains significant - and has been upheld in Italian and European courts.

In 2011, the European Court for Human Rights overturned its own earlier decision and ruled that state schools in Europe could hang crucifixes in classrooms, concluding that they were "an essentially passive symbol whose influence on pupils was not comparable to that of didactic speech or participation in religious activities."

That second ruling came after an uproar in Italy when the crucifixes were initially banned.

The latest prayer controversy in Bologna emerged after priests began their Lenten ritual of canvassing their parishes, carrying supplies of consecrated water, in order to offer Easter blessings to shops, offices and individual homes.

"There are many people who have never been to church - but they are happy to have their houses blessed!" Father Zoboli said.

Yet a group of parents and teachers was not happy about blessing Giosuè Carducci Elementary and two other schools in the same district. Angela Giardino, a mother of a Carducci student, said she sent an email to all the parents of her child's classmates, trying to stir a discussion, warning that the prayer infringed on the rights of non-Catholics and could violate the Constitution.

"No one answered me," said Ms. Giardino, who added that she did not oppose religion or anyone's right to practice it (or their right to receive a blessing) - only where it is conducted.

"Everything has a place, and the school is not the place for these blessings," she said.

European countries delineate the church-state split in different ways. France is famous for its laïcité, a strict division that largely forbids religious expression in the public sphere.

"In Italy, it is different," said Francesco Clementi, a constitutional law expert at Perugia University. "We do not have religion in the state, but we have tradition and relationships that link the Italian Republic with the Catholic Church."

Many Italian schools have nativity scenes around Christmas or hold assemblies to sing Christmas songs. The argument is that these rituals are part of the cultural legacy of Italy, a point contested by staunch secularists.

"Is it fair that everyone has to see this, even if some students are Muslims, Buddhist or atheists?" asked Adele Orioli, legal adviser to Italy's Union of Atheists and Rationalistic Agnostics.

The Rev. Raffaelle Buono, who oversees religious education in the Bologna schools, disagreed.

"What do you mean by this term "laity"?" he asked. "Two words: inclusive and exclusive. The French way of understanding laity is to exclude. You have to ban every religious symbol. In Italy, by tradition, we understand laity as inclusive. You have to put value on your "belongings," including your religious "belongings.""

He added: "It is not a matter of faith. It is a matter of belonging to a tradition."

In Bologna, the prayer controversy quickly rippled into local newspapers and stirred anger on social media against the complainants. Some said that liberals were willing to make special accommodations to Muslims but not Catholics. Others warned that stripping schools of Christian rituals would open society to an Islamic invasion.

The March 12 school board meeting at Carducci Elementary was also contentious. The board had selected March 20, 21 and 28 for prayers at Carducci and the two other schools in the district. With anger boiling over, the board voted for the dates.

"The debate was heated because there is a lot of hatred against anything that has to do with religion," said Giovanni Prodi, 43, the board chairman, after the meeting. "I am a practicing Catholic. I think it is a good thing."

The court hearing will be held Thursday, and Italy's association of atheists and agnostics is also a party to the case. "We are defending the laity of the state and of public schools," Ms. Orioli said.

No matter what the court decides, the decision's impact will come. The prayers were held at all three district schools last Friday and Saturday. The prayer scheduled for this Saturday, two days after the court hearing, has been canceled.

South Africa: Public Protector Questions How VBS and CR17 Scandals Were Dealt With

Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has questioned why the details of private bank statements of some people who are said to have benefited from the VBS Mutual Bank scandal were published, but the CR17 fund records were sealed by the courts.

Addressing students at the Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) south campus in Soshanguve, Pretoria on Thursday, Mkhwebane said: "Again, details of private bank statements of some people who are said to have benefited from the VBS scandal are published all the time.

"I don't speak for those accused, but why is it that no one has come forward to say it is wrong to publish such private information?"

"I pose these questions because when bank statements pertaining to a certain case of campaign funding are published, we see the courts going as far as to seal that information from the public without even having the case argued in an open court.

"We see the information regulator stepping in. Where is the consistency?"

<START>[Q27449522|Mkhwebane] was addressing [Q48282|students] about "good governance, accountability and transparency."

In [DATETIME|July], [Q27449522|Mkhwebane] found that [Q1148669|Ramaphosa] had deliberately misled [Q2185780|Parliament] when responding to a question about a R[QUANTITY|500 000] donation to [COREF:Q1148669|his] [DATETIME|2017] [Q83162|ANC] presidential campaign. [COREF:Q27449522|She] recommended that the campaign be investigated for money laundering.

But [Q1148669|Ramaphosa] has taken that [Q10870555|report] on review, and has argued that [Q27449522|Mkhwebane] overstepped [COREF:Q27449522|her] authority by expanding [COREF:Q27449522|her] investigation from the R[QUANTITY|500 000] donation, to the financing of [COREF:Q1148669|his] entire campaign.<END>

Ramaphosa had raised questions about where Mkhwebane received some of the bank statements contained in her Bosasa report, going as far as suggesting that she obtained them unlawfully.

Mkhwebane's office, however, maintains that her report is above board.

Ramaphosa had approached the Gauteng High Court in a bid to have certain bank statements in her report sealed and not made available to the public.

Deputy Judge President Aubrey Ledwaba later issued a directive which effectively sealed the file, until the dispute over the legality of the evidence could be resolved.

Ash Carter says US killed ISIS leaders linked to 2015 Paris attacks in Syrian airstrike

Two key ISIS members involved in the November 2015 Paris attacks have been killed in a US-led coalition drone strike in the ISIS 'capital' of Raqqa, the Pentagon has announced.

The strike, which took place on December 4, also killed a third leader, who was linked to another, foiled attack, Defense Secretary Ash Carter told US airmen at a military base in Italy on Tuesday.

'The three were working together to plot and facilitate attacks against Western targets at the time of the strike,' Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said.

<START>Scroll down for video

The attack took place on [DATETIME|December 4] in [Q283368|Raqqa], around [QUANTITY|100] miles from [Q41183|Aleppo].

[Q7173371|Cook] said the [QUANTITY|two] involved in the [Q21479779|Paris attacks], [Q56449062|Salah Gourmat] and [Q28030675|Sammy Djedou], were close [Q2868277|associates] of [Q2429253|Islamic State] [Unknown1|external operations [Q1251441|leader]] [Q17544625|Abu Mohammed al-Adnani], who was killed in [DATETIME|August].<END>

Those attacks saw more than 130 people killed across the French capital in a series of coordinated attacks.

He said the third militant, Walid Hamman, had been convicted in absentia in Belgium for a disrupted 2015 planned attack.

Hamman was a 'suicide attack planner', Cook said.

All three were members of a network once led by Boubaker Al-Hakim, who was linked to the January 2015 attack on the controversial French magazine Charlie Hebdo.

That incident saw 12 people killed and 11 more injured after brothers Saïd and Chérif Kouachi, entered the offices with assault rifles and other weapons and opened fire.

Al-Hakim was killed in November this year, in another drone attack.

Last week the US announced that a total of 50,000 ISIS fighters have been killed over the past two years.

The 2015 Paris attacks saw 137 people killed and another 368 people injured in six attacks across the city.

Those attacks saw the men firing into restaurants and cafes and detonating suicide vests, and climaxed with a mass shooting and hostage situation at the Bataclan theater, where 89 of the 1,500 people attending were killed.

Seven of the nine perpetrators were killed at the scene of their crimes.

The other two were killed in a raid by police and soldiers in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis two days later, alongside a third suspect. Five other suspects were taken in by police.

5,000 migrants will have already crossed the Channel this year

More than 5,000 migrants will have crossed the Channel in small boats this year by this weekend.

Undeterred by the tragic death of a young Sudanese man earlier this week, hundreds more are expected to attempt to reach Britain in the coming days.

Yesterday the Home Office announced 164 migrants arrived on the Kent coast in 11 boats on Wednesday, and 41 were picked up by the French.

A further eight men from Nigeria, Guinea, Gambia and Sierra Leone were picked up by the Border Force yesterday.

This takes the number who have made the journey this year to 4,994. Given that there have been new arrivals almost every day for the past few weeks, the total is expected to surge past the 5,000 mark today.

More than 1,400 migrants have already crossed the Channel in small boats in August alone - a record for a single month - despite there still being ten days before September.

By contrast, just 1,850 successfully crossed the Channel in the whole of last year.

The death of the Sudanese migrant on Wednesday once again stoked up cross-Channel tensions, with Calais MP Pierre-Henri Dumont claiming Britain's asylum policy was to blame for the tragedy.

Tory MP Tim Loughton, a former children's minister, hit back, claiming the "lack of humanity" lay with the French for letting migrants attempt to cross the Channel.

Former marine Dan O'Mahoney, who is leading Britain's response to the illegal crossings, arrived in France yesterday to continue searching for a solution.

Following his meetings, he said: "[Wednesday's] incident, where a Sudanese migrant lost his life attempting to cross the Channel, served as a tragic reminder of the vital importance of the work the UK and France are engaged in to make this route completely unviable."

Mr O'Mahoney added: "People should seek asylum in the first safe country they enter.

"Those attempting to cross the Channel, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, in unsuitable boats and without appropriate... skills are putting at risk the lives of all those on board."

Paris has demanded £30million from the UK Government to bolster its Channel patrols, but Home Secretary Priti Patel said any such funds are conditional on France taking back some of the migrants.

<START>Almost [QUANTITY|450] migrants, who claim to be under the age of [QUANTITY|18], have arrived without relatives [DATETIME|this year]. They are all being cared for by [Q6386127|Kent County Council] - which is looking after a total of [QUANTITY|605] under-[QUANTITY|18]s.

[DATETIME|This week] [COREF:Q6386127|the council] said [COREF:Q6386127|its] capacity has reached its limits and [COREF:Q6386127|it] "simply cannot safely accommodate any more new arrivals."

In an attempt to resolve the problem, [Q83307|ministers] have urged other councils to take in some of the unaccompanied migrant children.<END>

The Home Office, the Department for Education and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government are writing to all local authorities urging them to "come forward, play their part and take responsibility."

A Home Office spokesman described the situation as "unprecedented" and said the burden being placed on Kent council "is unacceptable and cannot continue."

Councils now receive £240 per child per week, with more funding provided for those helping the greatest number of children.

But critics have said the voluntary nature of the scheme renders it ineffective and insist it should be made a mandatory requirement for councils.

The Bishop of Dover, Rt Rev Rose Hudson-Wilkin, the Church of England's first black female bishop, accused politicians of "playing to the gallery."

Clubs key says Scottish Athletics" Ian Beattie as Richard Bowker quits

Scottish Athletics chair Ian Beattie has backed calls for a root and branch review of the sport after the embattled chair of UK Athletics, Richard Bowker, finally quit after a campaign to force his resignation.

It follows three months of pressure on the former Virgin Rail executive to step down in a row over his strategic vision for the sport and his much-criticised plans to effectively merge UKA with England Athletics.

<START>After a motion of no-confidence was pushed through [DATETIME|last month] by the governing [Unknown1|UK Athletics Members Council], [Q22|[Q181634|Scottish]] [Q1162163|chiefs] led moves to ensure [COREF:Q7324282|his] formal removal through internal governance procedures.

Although that was all but guaranteed to cut short [COREF:Q7324282|his] tenure after less than [QUANTITY|two] years by the middle of [DATETIME|February], [Q7324282|Bowker] will officially leave [COREF:Q7324282|his] post at the end of [DATETIME|this month], with ex-[Unknown2|Olympic [Q13382460|marathon runner]] [Q7422745|Sarah Rowell] taking interim charge.

Major changes are now needed, [Unknown3|Beattie] insisted, with the sport accused of failing to capitalise on the legacy of the [Q8577|London 2012 Olympics].<END>

"We need to get all of the sport in the UK working together - from the elite to the clubs to officials and grassroots," Beattie said. "It's been disconnected up to now. UK Athletics, even before Richard, has focused on events, governance and high performance. It wasn't interested in clubs. But if you look at the likes of Laura Muir and Callum Hawkins, they came through those clubs.

"I think Richard understood that actually. But he went about things the wrong way. But now it's important now that a new chair comes in quickly."

Bowker's exit will also delay the search for a new chief executive for UKA which has yet to be begin. Previous boss Niels de Vos left last September with ex-Scottish Athletics supremo Nigel Holl set to remain in temporary charge for the foreseeable future.

Johnny Depp jokes about killing Trump

Johnny Depp who says he 'lies for a living,' has apologised for joking about assassinating Donald Trump.

Depp was Glastonbury Festival's inaugural guest at its new Cineramageddon drive-in movie theatre in Britain on Thursday night - and he certainly gave the place a memorable launch. While introducing a screening of his 2004 movie The Libertine, he made inflammatory statements about President Donald Trump.

"I think he needs help and there are a lot of wonderful dark, dark places he could go," Depp said, according to the Guardian.

He then asked the crowd, "When was the last time an actor assassinated the president?"

The answer is 1865, when John Wilkes Booth shot and killed Abraham Lincoln at Ford's Theatre.

"It is just a question - I'm not insinuating anything," he assured the crowd. "By the way, this is going to be in the press. It will be horrible. I like that you are all a part of it."

He also claimed that he wasn't referring to himself, since he's not really an actor.

"I lie for a living," he clarified. "However, it has been a while and maybe it is time."

White House officials were not amused.

"The joke is no laughing matter," Kellyanne Conway, counsellor to the president, told The Washington Post in a phone interview. "These things are real."

Conway called Depp a "nut job" and said his statement was "not a slip of the tongue" but rather a deliberate attempt to spread "vile" ideas that could "easily inflame lunatics who wish to bring harm."

[My joke] did not come out as intended, and I intended no malice.

Johnny Depp

A Secret Service spokesman told The Post that the agency is "aware of the comment in question. For security reasons, we cannot discuss specifically nor in general terms the means and methods of how we perform our protective responsibilities."

Depp is hardly the first celebrity to target Trump.

Madonna came under fire in January, after she said she'd "thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House."

Comedian Kathy Griffin was roundly criticised - and fired from CNN - after she was photographed holding a mask of what looked like President Trump's bloody severed head.

"We expect actors and musicians and others to continue to spew hateful rhetoric," Conway said Friday.

How, she wondered, will people react to Depp's remarks?

"Will people chide him, discipline him or drop him?" she asked.

In a sharply worded statement to The Post, deputy White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said: "President Trump has condemned violence in all forms and it's sad that others like Johnny Depp have not followed his lead. I hope that some of Mr. Depp's colleagues will speak out against this type of rhetoric as strongly as they would if his comments were directed to a Democrat elected official."

This isn't the first time Depp has aired his feelings about Trump; he played the then-candidate in Funny or Die's The Art of the Deal: The Movie in early 2016. But that was mere parody - not something the Secret Service might need to investigate.

Depp has been the subject of plenty of bad press in the past year. First there was the very public implosion of his short marriage to Amber Heard, who claimed the actor had physically abused her. Photos of her bruised face circulated on the Internet.

Meanwhile, Depp sued his business managers, who then countersued, going public with some unsavory accusations about the actor, saying that he has compulsive spending disorder and had squandered hundreds of millions of dollars with an outrageously extravagant lifestyle that included spending $30,000 every month on wine. According to a Hollywood Reporter story about Depp's recent troubles, he was also difficult on the set of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, where he routinely showed up late for work, leaving the cast and crew waiting around for hours.

And now there are his statements at Glastonbury.

If Kathy Griffin's experience joking about Trump's death - by holding up a fake severed head that resembled the president - is any indication, there could be some serious blowback. Griffin ended up making a tearful apology but still lost her New Year's Eve gig with CNN.

This isn't Depp's first public apology. He had to do so on videotape when he and Heard illegally smuggled their dogs into Australia. The formal apology the pair made was stilted and stiff but at least seemed genuine. Later, Depp told Jimmy Kimmel that there had been a few takes of the mea culpa, since it was hard for him to keep his composure.

So much for saying sorry. But Depp said it himself: He lies for a living.

Boeing wins $23.6M contract to keep Navy F/A-18 planes flying

Aug. 23 (UPI) -- Boeing Co. was awarded a $23.6 million contract by the U.S. Navy for support in solving maintenance issues of F/A-18 Hornet fighter planes.

<START>The contract, a modification of a prior contract and announced on [DATETIME|Thursday] by the [Q11209|Defense Department], calls for [Q11023|engineering], [Q177777|logistics], and [Q603948|program management] of [Q17486173|F/A-18A]-[Q15887960|D], [Q223318|E/F], and [Q890185|[Q890185|EA-18G] aircraft] in support of reducing fleet "out of reporting" rates and maintenance planning.

The term refers to a plane grounded because of maintenance or repair issues. The planes, in service since the [DATETIME|1970s], are currently flown by the [Q11218|U.S. Marine Corps] as [COREF:Q11218|its] front-line fighter, by the [Q11220|U.S. Navy] as a [QUANTITY|second]-tier fighter, and also by [QUANTITY|seven] international customers. The [Q11218|Marine] and [Q11220|Navy] planes are expected to have a service life of [QUANTITY|20] years, but are wearing out faster than expected due to extensive use.

[Q11209|Defense Department] contracts for maintenance and upgrades are regular and numerous, and have included replacement center barrel sections -- the center section of the plane where wings are joined to the fuselage, an expensive undertaking -- and re-opening of production lines. Some of the repairs have been offered to allied air forces, which maintain their own refurbishment and upgrade programs.<END>

In April alone, three contracts to fix problems on the F/A-18 were announced. Sierra Nevada Corp. received a $13.5 million to fix beacon transmitter and receiver issues, International Enterprise Inc. won a $7.3 million contract to repair color instrument displays and General Electric received a $77.6 million contract for engine repairs.

In May, Boeing was awarded a $163.9 million one-year contract to continue modernizing the U.S. Navy's F/A-18E/F fighter jet fleet under the service life modification program.

The planes also use different radar systems, depending on the countries which own them.

The contract announced on Thursday is expected to be completed by September 2020.

David Beckham's company makes £2million a month

Victoria Beckham's fashion label continues to be beset by financial troubles, new figures reveal.

Accounts filed for the luxury label, which sells high-end dresses and acccessories, saw losses almost double to £8.5 million last year - up from £4.3million in 2015.

Meanwhile husband David's company DB Ventures, which handles the former footballer's endorsement deals, reported a profit of £24.9million after tax in 2016. This is the equivalent to roughly £2million a month.

Sales at VBL remained stable over the year however losses grew on the back of increased investment in the fashion brand's design, marketing and sales.

Earlier this year the former pop star's fashion business was valued at £100million following a major cash injection from former Goldman Sachs banker David Belhassen, the man behind French-inspired bakery chain Paul.

Mr Belhassen runs Neo Investment Partners which has bought a minority stake in the firm for £30million.

News of her financial woes comes 12 months after it was revealed the star had been formally warned the business - which employs 180 staff - could be closed down after failing to file its accounts on time.

Robert Dodds, a director at Victoria Beckham Limited, identified the company's partnership with Target and its Estee Lauder collaboration as two areas likely to bring the company more growth in 2017.

<START>Writing in the financial statement, [COREF:Unknown1|he] wrote: 'The further announcement of a global license agreement with [Q466183|Reebok] will further enhance the future profitability of [COREF:Unknown2|the business].'

However it was a very different story for [Unknown3|DB Ventures]. Sales rose from £[QUANTITY|10.2million] in [DATETIME|2015] to £[QUANTITY|11.2million] [DATETIME|last year] due to income from partnerships with drinks company [Q161140|Diageo], which makes [Unknown4|Haig Club whisky], and insurance group [Unknown5|AIA Vitality], among others. [COREF:Q10520|He] also has endorsement deals with [Q85774000|[Q85774000|Kent and Curwen] menswear] and [Q3895|Adidas].

[Q10520|David] also boasts over [QUANTITY|40 million] followers on [Q209330|Instagram] - more than double that of the mother of [COREF:Q10520|his] [QUANTITY|four] children - from which [COREF:Q10520|he] can gain considerable revenue as a social media '[Q2906862|influencer]'.<END>

Fortunately for Victoria, she is not dependent on her fashion business to maintain her lifestyle.

She controls a large stake in the main holding company for her and David's business ventures, Beckham Brand Holdings (BBH).

Ownership of the firm is split equally between Victoria, David and Fuller's company XIX Management. BBH contains Victoria's fashion business along with another branch of the couple's complex financial empire, DB Ventures Ltd.

Discovery could help determine which cancer patients will benefit from immunotherapy -- ScienceDaily

It's a popular question: What did you do over the summer? For Lubaba (Aurna) Khan, the summer of 2018 will be one she will never forget.

It started on a high note and ended on an even higher one. In June, Khan walked across the stage to accept her degree as a University of Calgary Bachelor of Health Sciences graduate. She received an O'Brien Centre Summer Studentships award, landing a research job with Dr. Pinaki Bose, PhD. Then, unexpectedly, she made a discovery that could help cancer patients throughout the world.

Khan spent the summer hunched over a computer interpreting free, publicly accessible health and genomics data. "Bioinformatics is the new frontier of medical science," says Khan. "I started my medical education as a biomedical student, looking at cells through a microscope, but looking at cancer biology with the assistance of a computer opens up a new way of thinking about research."

Khan was comparing the differences between genes found in cancer cells and those found in normal cells. Working under the guidance of Bose, Khan learned how to construct questions and hypotheses. It was a bumpy start.

"We wanted to find out how immune genes in cancer cells might be associated with immunotherapy response. There was nothing there, and we were disappointed," says Bose, who is an adjunct assistant professor in the departments of biochemistry and molecular biology, and oncology, and is a member of the Arnie Charbonneau Cancer Institute at the Cumming School of Medicine.

"We adjusted our focus, and discovered that another set of genes, those associated with the extracellular matrix, had a direct connection to how cancer patients respond to immunotherapy."

Immunotherapy has become a popular treatment for some cancers. It uses the body's own immune system to attack and kill cancer cells. The treatment is effective, but only for a select few, around 20 to 30 per cent of patients. There is not a clear understanding as to why some people respond better to immunotherapy than others.

The extracellular matrix may hold some of the answers; it grows within and around both healthy and cancerous cells.

<START>"We found that genes associated with the [Q193825|extracellular matrix] are overly produced in patients who do not respond to immunotherapy," says [Q92051568|Bose], who is also the [Unknown1|[Q1162163|director] of translational research] for the [Unknown2|Ohlson Research Initiative]. "These genes are produced by cells surrounding the tumour, and they form a barrier which helps cancer cells evade detection by the [Q1059|immune system]."

The [Q1067471|UCalgary] team shared the discovery with [Q1650915|researchers] at the [Q180865|University of Toronto] who have validated the findings, now published in [Q573880|Nature Communications]. "[COREF:Unknown3|I] was like, wow, [COREF:Unknown3|I]'m a [Q315247|student]. [COREF:Unknown3|I] didn't realize how important this was until [Q92051568|Dr. Bose] pointed out how significant this discovery could be in cancer treatment. It kind of threw [COREF:Unknown3|me] off, but [COREF:Unknown3|I] was extremely excited at the same time," says [Unknown3|Khan], who is a [Q99516972|co-first author] on the study.

The [Q1650915|researchers] looked more deeply at [COREF:Q1650915|their] findings and discovered a gene signature, which could lead to the development of a simple test that could help determine which patients would benefit from immunotherapy. The next step will be to prove the findings in a lab.<END>

"Analyzing big data won't replace bench science, but it a great tool for hypothesis-building and leading to new insights," says Bose.

For Khan, this experience has changed the course of her future studies. She always planned to pursue a master's degree in public health, and now sees a future focused on data analysis rather than data collection.

Pinaki Bose's research is supported by Ohlson Research Initiative and the Charbonneau Cancer Institute.

Fifteen years is a long time in body fat. As Flog It! celebrated its 1,000th programme, one could only gasp in horror at the changing shape of the nation.

For the most part, the key presenters on the valuation side had held up, especially host Paul Martin, who actually looks in better form today than he did in 2002 (not least because he's ditched his selection of scarves that should have been flogged along with everything else). But goodness - the difference in the public who turn up to sell their antique wares.

We must be grateful that widescreen TV is more available today than it was when the series was launched. As the crowd assembled at Bletchley Park for this special edition, it was like watching the entire passenger list of a Caribbean cruise descend en masse. (Trust me, I've been on one - how any cruise ship stays afloat is beyond me.)

The only exercise the latest batch of hopefuls seems to have managed is the stairway to the attic in the hope of retrieving another gross family heirloom to sell at the show's auction.

You could almost see the words More Dosh for Tesco Big Food Shop On Friday flash in their relieved eyes when their antique raised more than had been expected.

I've never been a big fan of antiques, but then I am someone who could happily live in an Apple Store window for my entire life. The oldest thing I own is the iPhone 6S, so I was never going to give two figs about ornament horror. But Flog It! is a terrific show. It has beautiful locations - the flashbacks again revealed the truly wondrous places the UK has to offer - and Martin sustains the tension and excitement.

The problem is that an interesting object can be in the possession of a dull owner, and it is Martin's job to keep the pace and energy up and make people appear more scintillating than they are. And he does. He never comes across as false - just a real enthusiast for antiques and a TV gig he has clearly loved from day one.

Despite my hatred of chipped porcelain and dust, this trip down memory lane reminded us how a simple TV idea can be executed beautifully. Sustaining it over 15 years is a real achievement. Maybe I'll raid my own attic and go along for the 2,000th anniversary - all supposing I can acquire another three stone to make me eligible to take part.

John Whaite and Rosemary Shrager, the Laurel and Hardy of culinary TV, returned with a second series of Chopping Block, where three couples hope to win £1,000 in a cookery "school."

Rosemary has eaten so many pies, I expect to see her very soon as a Flog It! extra. I've loved her ever since she appeared in Ladette To Lady, trying to instill in ghastly girls a model of decorum.

She is funny, clearly a terrific chef, and delivers an honest and firm, rather than aggressive approach (this is daytime TV, after all).

It was all going fantastically well (and I learned more than I do on most cookery shows), but then, after friends Phill and Liam won both the Skills and Main Course rounds, Desserts was split between the other two pairs. And then, who were the winning pair of the day..? All three. Come on, guys; it's a competition. Even in daytime TV, there has to be the "reveal" moment.

A terrific show was spoilt by not just one cop-out but two. I learned how to temper chocolate, though, which was a real eye-opener as I never knew chocolate could be so angry.

If you haven't caught the award-winning This Is Us, the Channel 4 import from the US, I urge you to do so. This week's episode was one of the most moving of the series as Randall (Sterling K Brown) took his dying dad William (Ron Cephas Jones) to Memphis, where the latter had the opportunity to perform one more time.

The series, which switches between the current day and flashbacks showing how everyone became who they were, is a sublime piece of television.

Beautifully crafted scripts are complemented by a cast who never fail to deliver. It's original, fresh, emotional without being mawkish, and has two very fat characters addressing their body issues.

Chrissy Metz (Kate) is fat in real life; Chris Sullivan (Kate's boyfriend, Toby) wears a fat suit for the role. Large people in America are currently up in arms over this devastating revelation, insisting that there are plenty of genuinely fat people out there.

You're telling me. Flog "em, I say.

Tony Blair: I don't regret opening UK borders to European immigrants

He added: "I think most sensible people in Britain can see immigrants have made a great contribution to our country."

In a BBC interview, Mr Blair also indicated that he would like to return to a high-profile "public role" and said that he could have continued as Prime Minister.

"I have always said I am a public service person first," he said. "I would have been happy to carry on as Prime Minister, I would have been happy taking the European job as president of the EU."

Was Labour right to relax immigration controls in 2004?

There is growing speculation that the former Labour leader is pushing to become the next European President. After keeping a relatively low profile in this country, Mr Blair has now given two major BBC interviews this month and will appear at a Labour Party fundraiser next month.

Mr Blair insisted that Britain could still join the single currency if the problems in the eurozone are addressed.

The former Prime Minister also urged Germany to do more to "save" the single currency ahead of a key summit in Brussels later this week.

"The only thing that will save the single currency now is in a sense a sort of grand plan in which Germany is prepared to commit its economy fully to the single currency," Mr Blair said.

"That means treating the debts of one as the debts of all, which is very hard for Germany to do.

"It means the other countries in the eurozone need to reform, need precise credible programmes of change to reform so that Europe can regain its competitiveness.

<START>"Otherwise it is quite unfair to ask [Q183|Germany] to pay."

But [Q9545|[Q177053|Mr] [Q9545|Blair]] - a prominent Europhile - refused to accept that the single currency's troubles meant the [Q145|UK] would never join.

"If they sort it all out and [Q458|Europe] moves forward again then [Q145|Britain] is going to have a very interesting choice to make," [COREF:Q9545|he] said.<END>

Speaking of his policy towards joining the euro when he was Prime Minister, Mr Blair added: "I always took the view that economically you had to make an unambiguous case for Britain joining.

"Politically however, I was always in favour of keeping us very positive towards the project of European integration, and able to join at any time we wanted to do so."

The former premier said the "broad sweep of history" showed that European integration would continue regardless of the fate of the eurozone. Britain needed to protect its alliance with the EU in order to exercise influence, he said.

How Kendrick Lamar and Jay Rock's 'King's Dead' music video achieved those impossibly long zooms

As if the sight of Kendrick Lamar eating an elote up a palm tree alone wasn't enough, there were more staggering, unprecedented visuals in the music video for his Jay Rock, Future and James Blake collaboration "King's Dead," including perhaps the longest camera zooms ever staged.

Pulling in and out of rooftops, the zooms were reminiscent of the kind Brian de Palma favoured back in the 80s, but had a hyperreal feel to them all of their own, the artists being shot as clearly as if the camera were there on the rooftops just a few feet away.

<START>Achieving them took a lot of brain power, the sourcing of rare lenses and a heroic effort from the [Q1639269|focus puller], [Q222344|Director of Photography] on [COREF:Unknown1|the video], [Unknown2|Christopher Ripley], explains.

"From the beginning, we knew that a lot of [COREF:Unknown1|the video]'s key moments would have to hinge on these impossibly long zooms," [COREF:Unknown2|he] told [Q11149|The Independent]. "[Q113624973|Dave (Free)] and [Unknown3|Jack (Begert], [Q24387718|co-directors]) were both really excited to avoid visual effects as much as possible. They wanted to really put all [QUANTITY|three] [Q483501|artists] on rooftops and find a way to do the zooms for real.

"[COREF:Unknown2|I] spent a couple days researching esoteric zoom lenses and eventually came across this rare [Q62621|Canon] [QUANTITY|50]-[QUANTITY|1000]mm zoom they had made for [Q38926|news] and sports crews. We started calling around but nobody had that lens. Eventually, we found [QUANTITY|one] on them available at a rental house in [Q39561|Burbank] but even that wasn't really enough range to take us all the way from street level to a clear shot of someone performing on a rooftop. [COREF:Unknown2|I] ended up having to rent a ridiculously high resolution [QUANTITY|8k] camera so that they could digitally zoom even further into the image and get to where they needed to be."<END>

Actually pulling the shot off by hand proved challenging however and (not for the first time in a Kendrick video) robots had to be brought in.

"Dave and Jack also wanted to be able to quickly zoom in and have the camera land on a perfect frame, perfectly on beat with the song," Ripley explained. "But when you're all the way zoomed in on a freakishly long lens, even the tiniest mistake makes the frame completely different. During our tests, we would sometimes even see the frame shake whenever traffic drove by.

"So I needed something that could give us a lot of really precise control over the framing. I called up a company in Santa Monica that specializes in robotic camera controllers and did a few tests, and we finally settled on a small robotic unit that would perfectly pan and tilt the camera and control the zoom, so it could smash in from a super wide into an impossibly close shot and land a perfect frame every time.

"I've done a number of crazy robotic rigs with that company over the years and they're always super nonchalant: "Oh, yeah, one of those, no problem. We've done that a million times," but when I pitched them the zoom setup, they stopped for a second and then said, "Yeah, we're gonna have to test that. We've never done anything like that before." I was thrilled I finally found something they hadn't done before."

One element of the shots that couldn't be controlled by a robot, however, was the focus, as the team wanted to be able to react on the fly to the artists if they switched up their performance and moved differently.

Ripley added: "My focus puller Megan [McCarthy Johnson] was really under the gun - she had to keep everything perfectly in focus as the camera was robotically whipping around between people and crash-zooming in and out. She did an amazing job and kept her cool the whole job."

The results of this process, also used for the scenes of Kendrick in the palm tree and Jay Rock in the barbers, are iconic, and though the shots are dramatic they're edited in such a way that they still feel in keeping with the goofy overall tone of the video.

MPs hear of more meddling from FIFA

The extent FIFA president Gianni Infantino and his lieutenants go to in order to influence supposed independent decision-making in Zurich was laid bare in Westminster yesterday.

Former FIFA governance chief Miguel Maduro, who lasted 11 months in the post, told the DCMS sport select committee that his sacking followed him blocking Russian deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko from the FIFA Council because of a conflict of interests with his senior political role.

But FIFA secretary general Fatma Samoura warned Maduro that barring Mutko would lead to next year's World Cup in Russia being a 'disaster' and place Infantino's presidency in jeopardy.

Portuguese academic Maduro, speaking under parliamentary privilege, said: 'The secretary general made it clear to me that it was extremely problematic.

'More than that, she said we needed to find a solution to declare Mr Mutko eligible, otherwise the presidency itself would be in question and the World Cup would be a disaster.'

Interference from on high at FIFA has also led to former investigative ethics chief Cornel Borbely - axed like Maduro on the eve of the FIFA Congress in Bahrain last May - having to turn down a request to give evidence to the same select committee about sports governance.

Chairman Damian Collins wrote to Infantino seeking permission for Borbely to attend but received a letter back from Samoura. She refused on the grounds of confidentiality, adding Borbely could face potential criminal action under Swiss law if he did so.

Collins said he was surprised that Samoura, rather than Infantino, had replied and did not refer the request to the FIFA ethics committee.

Answering questions about the lack of real change at FIFA since Infantino succeeded the disgraced Sepp Blatter, Maduro said Infantino had wanted to make reforms but had chosen to 'politically survive, preserving his presidency' above protecting the independent bodies.

It has not gone unnoticed by football agents, who dislike family overly interfering with their management of players, that three Premier League footballers who failed to achieve the transfers they wanted during the last window - Jonny Evans (above) of West Bromwich and Arsenal pair Calum Chambers and Jack Wilshere - all have family members involved in their representation.

Clubs tend to be a lot more honest with agents about a player's future than with his family, whom they would not want to upset.

Quest's bid for TV rights

Quest, the low-profile TV station, are one of the parties showing an interest in bidding for the Football League highlights contract which will start next season, with Channel 5 not expected to renew their partnership.

Quest is available on all platforms including Freeview and is a sister channel of Eurosport on the Discovery network who have the TV rights to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

Quest have already shown an interest in football by screening various pre-season tournaments and a clash of Eurosport scheduling has seen them pick up coverage of snooker and superbikes. It is also expected that the super-wealthy Liberty Group, who own Discovery, will offer considerably more for the Football League rights than BBC.

Only the commercially rampant RFU could start selling their new in-stadium England Rugby Hospitality at Twickenham, that launches in November 2018, before the start of this year's autumn internationals.

St. Petersburg's stadium for the 2018 World Cup held its first game Saturday with much fanfare, a ragged pitch and three red cards.

Construction on the 69,000-seat arena, named simply the St. Petersburg Stadium, started in 2007 but was repeatedly delayed and experienced several scandals, including corruption cases and workers' deaths.

Troubles continued at Saturday's opening game, with the field appearing to be in poor condition. There were large brown patches and chunks of the pitch frequently came loose.

The 69,000-seater stadium was only part-full as the top tier remained closed for the clash

Goals from Branislav Ivanovic (centre) and substitute Yohan Mollo secured a 2-0 victory

The grass had to be replaced recently after turf on the first field died. Lack of light has been blamed because the stadium's roof has often been closed and the mechanism allowing the retractable field to be moved outside isn't in use. That had to be fixed recently after complaints it was making the entire field wobble.

Visiting team Ural Yekaterinburg finished with just eight men as they were beaten 2-0 by Zenit St. Petersburg.

The stadium was only partly full because organizers decided not to open the top tier.

Ural's Roman Emelyanov hit the post in the 51st minute before the game changed when Eric Bicfalvi earned a second booking for what seemed to be a legitimate tackle. Enraged Ural striker Roman Pavlyuchenko confronted the referee and was also sent off.

<START>Ground staff were forced to tend to the playing surface during Zenit's victory on Saturday

The ground will host the Confederations Cup final this year and a World Cup semi-final in 2018

Former Chelsea defender defender Branislav Ivanovic scored with a header in the 86th minute, swiftly followed by Ural's third red card - this time for Emelyanov after he and Zenit's Artyom Dzyuba shoved each other.<END>

Substitute Yohan Mollo added a second goal for the hosts in stoppage time.

Designed to look like a spaceship on the shore of the Baltic Sea, the St. Petersburg Stadium will host the Confederations Cup final this year and a World Cup semifinal in 2018.

**** ARTICLE #117: 20150923 - Dinner With Saddam review - can dictators be funny? (None) *****
Dinner With Saddam review - can dictators be funny?

Can you have a comedy about tyranny? Chaplin got away with in The Great Dictator. But Anthony Horowitz's play faces two obvious problems. Given what we know about the tragic fate of Iraq, it is difficult to raise a smile about the embarrassments of Saddam Hussein dropping in for dinner. When a wildly farcical first half gives way to a sombre political message in the second, it is as if David Hare has suddenly taken over from Ray Cooney.

Horowitz has seized on the fact that Saddam did indeed descend on the homes of Baghdad citizens to avoid his enemies and show solidarity with his people. We see a deeply divided Sunni family, on the eve of invasion in March 2003, coping with the news that the leader is about to arrive. Husband and wife are at odds, their anti-Saddam daughter is in love with a Shia actor and the household is in chaos. But jokes about blocked toilets, water shortages and the confusion of rat poison and exotic spices that might seem funny in a western farce tend to stifle laughter when they occur in a city suffering from United Nations sanctions.

<START>With the arrival of [Q1316|Saddam] [COREF:Q1316|himself], [COREF:Unknown1|the [NO_COREF_ALT:Q25379|play]] takes a completely different turn. We are left in no doubt that [Q1316|Saddam], played with virtuosic menace by an almost unrecognisable, thickly moustached [Q529849|Steven Berkoff], is filled with the arbitrary cruelty of the [Q889870|despot]. A [Q856887|security guard] who unwisely yawns is taken out to be shot and, recalling the fate of [COREF:Q1316|his] kith and kin, [Q1316|Saddam] remarks on one who died a most unusual death: "It was completely natural."

[Q7499809|Shobu Kapoor], [Q3472307|Sanjeev Bhaskar], [Q506944|Rebecca Grant] and [Q19560588|Ilan Goodman] in [Unknown1|Dinner With Saddam]. Photograph: [Unknown2|Tristram Kenton] for [Q11148|the [Q11148|Guardian]]

[Q1316|Saddam] also becomes the vehicle for [Q279305|Horowitz]'s genuine anger about the actions of western governments: we are reminded that [COREF:Q1316|the [NO_COREF_ALT:Q183318|dictator]] would never have come to power without the [Q37230|CIA], that [Q846570|the [Q846570|Americans]] were supportive of [Q82664|[Q796|Iraq]'s war with [Q794|Iran]] and that [Q842438|the [Q842438|British]] were gassing [Q12223|Kurds] long before [Q1316|Saddam Hussein] was born. All these charges may be just, but they mean the farcical action is suspended in order to give [Q1316|Saddam] the floor.<END>

A part of me admires Horowitz, a skilled TV writer and author of a new James Bond novel, Trigger Mortis, for boldly using a popular form to make political points. But he never quite marries the two, and while I'm normally receptive to faecal and fart jokes, it's difficult to laugh when they stem from a sewage crisis caused by an international ban on the importation of chlorine.

The play is clearly prompted by a sense of savage indignation, but our collective guilt takes the shine off the farcical gingerbread. Berkoff, mixing uncivil leers at his host's daughter with the danger of a cobra who could strike at any moment, is always a pleasure to watch.

Lindsay Posner's fast-moving production has good support, from Sanjeev Bhaskar as the harassed householder, Rebecca Grant as his mutinous daughter and Ilan Goodman as both a security boss and a Shia soap star. But, as Shakespeare said in Love's Labour's Lost: "To move wild laughter in the throat of death? It cannot be, it is impossible."

MP 'scum' row: Shaun Bailey says his mother was abused after Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner used insult in Commons debate

A Conservative MP has claimed his mother and staff were abused after Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner called a colleague "scum" in parliament.

Ms Rayner apologised after she used the language about Tory MP Chris Clarkson during a fiery Commons debate on Wednesday.

<START>But [Q76363893|Shaun Bailey], the [Q16707842|MP] for [Q874568|West Bromwich West], suggested members of the public had copied [COREF:Q18164278|her] behaviour.

[COREF:Q76363893|He] said [DESC:Unknown1|[COREF:Q76363893|his] mother] had called [COREF:Q76363893|him] [DATETIME|last night] to say that "type of wording" had been used down the phone to [COREF:Unknown1|her] "because [COREF:Unknown1|she] was [DESC:Unknown1|[COREF:Q76363893|my] mother]."

"Did the honourable lady just call me scum?" - [Q9626|Tory] [Q16707842|MP] [Q76729340|Chris Clarkson] clashes with [Q9630|Labour]'s [Q18164278|Angela Rayner]<END>

Speaking in the Commons, Mr Bailey, the MP for West Bromwich West, said: "I can take the rough and tumble of this place as much as anyone.

"But some of the language we saw yesterday was abhorrent and particularly the use of the word "scum."

"Now, I'm sorry, but when I got a phone call at 11.30 last night from my mum saying she'd had people using that type of wording down the phone at her because she was my mother and today my staff members have called me [to report] that type of abhorrent abuse, it is absolutely not on."

Mr Bailey asked Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg for a debate on the standards of conduct in the chamber, adding: "The language we use impacts people beyond us."

Chris Clarkson was right but pompous to demand Angela Rayner apology

He suggested Ms Rayner should appear before MPs to apologise to them and "perhaps to my mum as well."

Mr Rees-Mogg reminded MPs of the guide to parliamentary practice, noting: "Good temper and moderation are the characteristics of parliamentary language.

"Inevitably, in discussing heated political matters, people state their case forcefully but they must do so politely."

Mr Clarkson said Ms Rayner had called him "scum" after he insinuated that members of the shadow front bench believe the Covid-19 pandemic is a "good crisis" to exploit.

Ms Rayner later apologised for the language "used in a heated debate."

**** ARTICLE #119: 20130124 - American Mumbai Plotter to Be Sentenced in Chicago (None) *****
American Mumbai Plotter to Be Sentenced in Chicago

A small-time American drug dealer-turned-terrorist plotter who helped plan a brutal 2008 attack on Mumbai, India, learns Thursday whether his wide-ranging cooperation with U.S. investigators will earn him any leniency from the sentencing judge.

David Coleman Headley, 52, faces a maximum life prison term when U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber sentences him for his role in a three-day rampage in which 10 gunmen from a Pakistani-based militant group fanned out across Mumbai, attacking a crowded train station, the landmark Taj Mahal Hotel and other targets. Around 160 people were killed, including children.

Prosecutors, though, are asking for a relatively lenient term of 30 to 35 years, which leaves open the possibility Headley one day could go free. Headley seemed to leap at the chance to spill secrets following his 2009 arrest and continued providing details even after the U.S. government agreed not to seek the death penalty in exchange for his cooperation.

"I and victims' families think he should spend the life in prison," said James Kreindler, an attorney for relatives of American victims. "Thirty-five years will upset some people ... but if that sentence means you got good information out of him ... and he gets out with a few years to live, some can tolerate it."

Prosecutors say Headley, who was born in the U.S. to a Pakistani father and American mother, was motivated in part by his hatred of India going back to his childhood. He changed his birth name from Daood Gilani in 2006 so he could travel to and from India more easily to do reconnaissance without raising suspicions.

He never pulled a trigger in the attack that's been called India's 9/11, but his contribution to the Pakistani-based militant group, Lashkar-e-Taiba, made the assault more deadly. He conducted meticulous scouting missions - videotaping and mapping targets - so the attackers who had never been to Mumbai adeptly found their way around.

"What he did was unfathomable," Kreindler said. "Imagine what is going through a person's mind who is videotaping these places knowing what will happen there later."

Prosecutors also praise Headley for testifying against Tahawwur Rana, a Chicago businessman convicted of providing aid to Lashkar and backing a failed plot to attack a Danish newspaper for publishing depictions of the Prophet Muhammad. Rana, sentenced last week to 14 years in prison, claimed his friend Headley duped him.

Testifying at Rana's trial, Headley spoke in a monotone voice, seemingly detached, even as he described one proposal for the never-carried-out Danish plot to behead newspaper staff and throw their heads onto a street.

<START>In video excerpts of [COREF:Q3521569|his] [Q178651|interviews] with the [Q8333|FBI] after [COREF:Q3521569|his] arrest, [Q3521569|Headley] appears flippant, cool and calculating. As [COREF:Q3521569|he] revealed [Q7675427|Rana]'s name, [COREF:Q3521569|he] told [DESC:Unknown1|an [Q1971388|[Q30093123|investigator]]] in an upbeat voice, "That probably is going to be good a plus for [COREF:Q3521569|me]. Also for [COREF:Unknown1|you]."

In big cases where suspects cooperate, [Q600751|prosecutors] often ask for leniency. It's both a reward and a message to future suspects that they, too, could get a break if they spill their secrets. Still, for a reviled figure like [Q3521569|Headley] to get a sentence less than sentences routinely meted out to convicted [Q10384029|drug traffickers] or child pornographers could prompt criticism.

[Q600751|Prosecutors] seemed to anticipate that in [COREF:Q600751|their] filing, acknowledging that, "Determining the appropriate sentence for [Q3521569|David Headley] requires consideration of uniquely aggravating and uniquely mitigating factors."

Barclays" 30-year attempt at taking on Wall Street is coming to an end

<START>This is a great shame, and not just for [COREF:Q245343|the bank] and [COREF:Q245343|its] [Q381136|shareholders]. There are many in [Q23311|the City] who would have liked to see a [Q145|UK]-based giant in investment banking; as these latest results confirm yet again, that boat has now sailed.

[Q245343|Barclays] will probably retain a decent presence in investment banking - though even that isn't truly certain anymore - but [COREF:Q245343|it] will not be part of the global top tier.

It all started for [Q245343|Barclays] in [DATETIME|1984] when it became clear that the old rules governing the [Q23311|City of London] were about to be torn up. Like many other institutions, [Q245343|Barclays] decided that [COREF:Q245343|it] needed to act fast, not to be left behind; with the benefit of hindsight, [COREF:Q245343|it] probably panicked. [DATETIME|That year] [COREF:Q245343|it] purchased stakes in [Unknown1|Wedd Durlacher Mordaunt], a firm of [Q7618097|jobbers], and then [Unknown2|de Zoete and Bevan], a [Q4182927|stockbroker]; both firms were fully integrated into [Q245343|Barclays]" own stockbroking business when the rules changed and full universal banking became permissible in [DATETIME|1986]. In [Unknown3|Barclays: The Business of Banking, 1690-1996], [Margaret Ackrill|Margaret Ackrill] and [Q16945478|Leslie Hannah] calculated that the [QUANTITY|two] firms managed to extract £[QUANTITY|129m] from [Q245343|Barclays] for their goodwill, a huge sum of money in those days that enriched the old partner families and made it one of the most expensive takeovers of the [Q2902142|Big Bang].<END>

Needless to say, it started to go wrong immediately for the new Barclays de Zoete Wedd: the cost of integrating the three firms" IT systems turned out to be prohibitive, and moving the combined businesses to a refitted ex-car park in the City also cost a fortune. Staff costs also jumped as a war for talent broke out, complete with golden hellos and golden parachutes. Nevertheless, by 1990 BZW, as Barclays" investment bank was called, had reached fifth on the global league tables for mergers and acquisitions. But by 1992, the property crash and recession meant that Barclays had to announce a big pre-tax loss; and even though this was a retail bank problem, by 1998 much of BZW was sold off to Credit Suisse.

The firm thought it couldn't compete in equity and corporate finance, which were the parts it flogged to the Swiss; the smaller, truncated successor to BZW was called Barclays Capital and focused on fixed income. But that was merely the end of Part II of the British bank's great dalliance with investment banking: an ambitious American banker called Bob Diamond had joined the firm two years previously. He soon started to grow the investment bank again, focusing on its core areas, and also built a major asset management business. In 2008, Barclays snapped up Lehman Brothers" US operations; it felt like a great bargain. The combined business looked as if it could rival the great titans of Wall Street.

The dream didn't last long, however, and not just because of Libor and the rest, scandals that affected the whole industry. First, Barclays Global Investors was sold to BlackRock to raise capital; and now the investment bank is being shrunk dramatically.

The problem was capital: firms held very little of it and were able to operate in a highly leveraged manner before the crisis. Now, they need to hold much greater amounts of capital, and many can no longer hide their fundamentally uneconomic nature. The industry is becoming more concentrated as a result of being safer, pushing minor, more marginal players out of business. Compliance costs have also exploded, which is having the same impact.

There are other reasons for the demise of some universal banks. One can be blamed on Brussels: EU rules on remuneration, which push up fixed costs, are utterly self-defeating and are - as one of many side-effects - inflicting great damage to the prospects of EU-based firms while helping US and Asian competitors. Another can be pinned on Westminster: the banking levy makes no sense.

Antony Jenkins has emphasised he is not going to be endlessly patient with the investment bank

When the Diamond era came to an end in 2012, the political and economic pressures were aligned. Jenkins" language this week - emphasising that he is not going to be endlessly patient with that part of the business - confirms that there is only one way for the investment bank, and that is down.

The rise, fall, rebirth and final decline of Barclays" investment bank is a tragic tale. It means that US, and in time Chinese banks, will eventually dominate that sector, for better or for worse.

My own view is that the City is a great platform; its success doesn't depend on the nationality of the investment banking players it hosts. One thing is for sure: my theory will soon be put to the test.

The Bachelorette Australia recap, episode 3: Sam Frost and Sasha kiss

IT'S episode three of The Bachelorette, so clearly it's time for one of the fellas to suck face with Sam and all the other boys to strip off and pose with puppies.

But before the fun begins, the boys are still upset about David breaking the "bro code" last week. To ensure this doesn't happen again, they call an emergency meeting - just like Kristy and the gals in The Baby-Sitters Club.

It's decided the legislation of "bro code" is far too confusing, so they replace it with a blanket rule of: just don't be a wang.

Osher walks in wearing a cardigan from his own fashion line, OsherKosher B'Gosher. He's got a single date card and Sasha's the lucky boy.

This single date's all about learning some kind of exotic dance. Sasha strips down to a Chesty Bonds and they proceed to rub up against each other.

Sam gets easily flustered by Sasha and it's hard to understand why. On one hand, he's the kind of brave yet caring guy who'd have no problem fishing your iPhone out of the toilet with his bare hands if you accidentally dropped it in. But on the other hand, he has weird Shannon Noll/sleazy real estate agent vibes.

After the dance lesson, they retire to the courtyard to drink cocktails. They trade beautiful stories about their step-dads and it makes me feel terrible for saying Sasha's a cross between Shannon Noll and a real estate agent.

The date ends with an official performance of the dance they learnt in full costume.

I don't know what's more embarrassing: the bad dance or Sasha's pants.

They're the same kind worn by check-out chicks at Woolworths across Australia. You know the ones - thigh hugging with a surprising flair at the bottom. Usually paired with a chunky black Colorado shoe.

"Do you have Flybuys?"Source:Channel 10

Medicating themselves with wine after that mortifying experience, Sasha drops that he was once engaged and Sam tries to play it cool. Then he scores a rose.

He wants to kiss her but he's waiting for a sign. While Sam tries to pin the rose on his shirt, he just stares at her without blinking for 30 secs. No pasha for Sasha.

Back at the mansion, the boys find a group date card. Pippi Longstocking has the honour of reading it.

It's Pippi Longstocking hey ho ho ha he ha ha.Source:Channel 10

Alex and Drew miss out and the other boys wind up on some farm where they meet Sam and Osher.

"I don't know if you guys know this about me but I'm a HUGE animal lover - especially when it comes to dogs," Sam says, with one of the dogs she once loved wrapped around her neck.

"I like animals but I LOVE fashion."Source:Channel 10

The fellas are told they'll be posing topless with dogs for a magazine photo shoot.

Sam says she selected the dogs to match each boy's personality. If that's the case, the choices are quite offensive.

TBH, the dogs hate being compared to a single guy on a dating show.Source:Channel 10

The most surprising thing to come out of the challenge is that we find out Josh Thomas has abs.

"Like Zooey Deschanel, I'm quirky AND sexy!"Source:Channel 10

Michael scores the single date after the challenge and Kayne is feeling overlooked.

He's been flying under the radar with Sam for quite some time now, so when the cocktail party rolls around, he's determined to impress her.

But how does a guy who did a failed handstand on his first night crank it up a notch? Turns out Kayne has two killer moves with the ladies: Acrobatics. And rap.

Not only has he written some sick rhymes for Sam, but he also decides to casually spit them out under the backyard gazebo.

It's mortifying. Oddly, I couldn't find the lyrics on metrolyrics.com along with all the other top 40 hits, so I transcribed them for you:

Yo, yo yo, check it.

Way back at the start of the year. Through the hard times, tear after tear.

I saw an ad for The Bachelorette season one. So I jumped online and filled the forms, it had begun.

Now here I am, which I never thought way back when. But look at me now, sitting in front of a perfect 10.

I'm very grateful for the roses and my group dates. I have more to offer, so I'll grab the wine and you grab the plates.

I'll give you the hot tip: when I first saw you, you made me bite my bottom lip.

Happiness is on the top, I must say. Treating people with respect, everyone equal, that's my life, namaste.

Print them out and put them on your fridge.

Kayne, what's good?Source:Channel 10

Sasha also scores some more one-on-one time. He's awkward because he's still dying to kiss Sam.

The tension between them is rising and it gets to the point where Sasha's either going to kiss Sam or dry hump the cane lounge. So Sam allows a pash. And she's all cool and confident about it.

The Woolworths pants sealed the deal.Source:Channel 10

Things aren't going so well for Drew or his hair. It was being a bit stubborn so he just had to slick it all up into a tight bun.

<START>A crappy hair day can ruin anyone's confidence, and it's all downhill from here for [Unknown1|Drew].

[Q30121870|Sam] knows that [Unknown1|Drew]'s fallen too fast too soon and [COREF:Q30121870|she]'s worried about [COREF:Unknown1|him]. [COREF:Q30121870|She] doesn't want to string [COREF:Unknown1|him] along for weeks and then hurt [COREF:Unknown1|him].

So when it comes time for the rose stubs to be distributed, [COREF:Unknown1|he] misses out.<END>

They then beam text messages to each other from across the room and all is right.

tips, racecards and preview for day two of The International meeting on Saturday

THE INTERNATIONAL meeting concludes on Saturday and there are several cracking betting opportunities to be had.

The Caspian Caviar Gold Cup and the International Hurdle are the feature races on a top day of jumping.


Race 1 - 12.10 JCB Triumph Trial Juvenile Hurdle

An intriguing opener can go the way of BOTOX HAS.

Gary Moore's youngster won by a wide-margin in a weak race on debut but ran a cracker in defeat here last month.

That looks the best form on offer and he gets the nod ahead of Flat recruit Group Stage, who was a cosy winner on hurdling bow at Leicester.

Langer Dan concedes weight all round but he is unbeaten and commands respect, while the booking of Richard Johnson on Tremwedge catches the eye.



Race 2 - 12.45 Ryman Novices' Chase

The Twiston-Davies team think the world of GOOD BOY BOBBY.

He was made to work harder than expected for victory at Wetherby last time, but he would have found the trip on the sharp side and he was strong at the finish.

<START>[COREF:Unknown1|He] will relish the return to 2m4f and can outstay [Unknown2|Mister Fisher], who ran well on chasing debut behind [Unknown3|Torpillo] at [Q7971170|Warwick]. [COREF:Unknown2|That rival] disappointed at [Q1765667|Sandown] [DATETIME|last weekend].

We likely haven't seen the best of [Unknown4|Beakstown] yet but [COREF:Unknown4|he] needs to start delivering on the track.

Market support for the talented [Unknown5|Champagne Platinum] should be noted on [COREF:Unknown5|his] first run of the season for [COREF:Unknown5|his] powerful connections.<END>



Race 3 - 1.20 Cheltenham Club Handicap Chase

DESTRIER ran with plenty of credit when third in the Haldon Gold Cup on his seasonal reappearance.

This is a drop in class and he gets the nod ahead of admirable veteran Croco Bay, who returns to the scene of his shock Grand Annual victory.

Ballywood was third on testing ground at Ascot last time and will prefer these sounder conditions, though there is a suspicion the handicapper has caught up with him.

Theinval runs for the first time since crashing out at Galway in the summer, but he won't be far away if putting his best foot forward.



Race 4 - 1.55 Caspian Caviar Gold Cup Handicap Chase (Grade 3)

It's a real pity that Riders Ofthe Storm won't take his place in the line-up, but it remains a fantastic race.

Cepage chased home that horse when a fine second at Aintree on his reappearance and he was second to Frodon in this contest 12 months ago.

His yard are in fine form and he looks sure to run a big race under top-weight, but he may have to settle for the silver medal again, this time behind WARTHOG.

David Pipe's charge ran a screamer on his first start after a wind op when third in the BetVictor Gold Cup here last month.

He jumped and travelled beautifully on the whole before getting tired from the back of the second last.

That will have blown away the cobwebs, his mark remains unchanged and he gets in off a feather-weight here.

Paul Nicholls has won five of the last 10 runnings of this valuable race and he holds another strong hand with Secret Investor and Brelan D'As.

Clondaw Castle ran well for a long way in the Arkle on his last visit here, and he is interesting now upped in trip. Not That Fuisse is another worth a place on the shortlist.



Race 5 - 2.30 Albert Bartlett Novices' Hurdle (Grade 2)

It could pay to side with THE MULCAIR for the Skelton's.

A winning pointer, he created a very positive impressive when thumping a good horse on his Rules bow.

Redford Road was second to the classy Valtor at Ascot last time, but the former is open to further progress at the age of five, particularly over this trip.

Mossy Fen is 2-2 under Rules and is the pick of Sam Twiston-Davies. He should also relish the step back up to three-miles.



Race 6 - 3.05 Unibet International Hurdle (Grade 2)

Not the strongest renewal of this race, and all eyes will be on Triumph Hurdle hero Pentland Hills.

The Champion Hurdle division needs a shot in the arm and he could well provide it - but it can often prove tricky for four-year-old's in their second season over hurdles and he is short enough.

Preference is for CALL ME LORD, who cruised through the Coral Hurdle at Ascot on his return and looked all over the winner for much of the race.

But he got tired close home and was eventually passed by thorough stayer If The Cap Fits with the pair pulling clear. He will appreciate the drop back to 2m.

Ch'Tibello has been a good servant to connections and won the County Hurdle in fine style at the Festival in March. He holds rock-solid claims.

Elixir De Nutz would probably have preferred slightly slower ground, but he is a fascinating contender on his first run since an easy Tolworth Hurdle win in January.



Race 7 - 3.40 Park Mares' Handicap Hurdle

A wide-open finale but the nod goes to MISTY BLOOM.

She was a decisive winner of a similarly competitive mares' event at Wincanton last time and her yard are enjoying a fantastic winter.

If an 11lb hike halts her in her tracks, the progressive Queens Cave could be best-placed to take advantage.

Indefatigable, Dame De Compagnie and northern raider Mega Yeats are also closely considered.

Bulgaria Disburses Millions More for Border Fence Deterring Migrants

<START>The [Q219|Bulgarian] government has allocated an additional BGN [QUANTITY|20 M] to [QUANTITY|three] southeastern regions where a fence is being built along the border with [Q43|Turkey].

The fence, which is referred to as a "temporary deterring installation," is aimed at "withstanding the migratory pressure on the [Q219|Bulgarian]-[Q43|Turkish] border growing over the past years" and at "stemming the wave of [Q131572|refugees]," according to a government [Q207184|press statement].

For more than [QUANTITY|two] years since [DATETIME|2014], when construction began, the costs have surpassed BGN [QUANTITY|100 M] as of this [Q1313|summer].<END>

Separately, the cabinet has disbursed BGN 0.407 M to repair border crossings and border police stations and equipment as part of "urgent measures relating to the accession of [Bulgaria] into the Schengen area."

As an upward migratory pressure on the southeastern border has been reported over the past few years, two successive Bulgarian governments have pledged to reduce the inflow of migrants through the fence, but even with much of the construction being finished, data shows the number of arrivals has not been strongly affected.

Kenya expecting oil boom? - UPI.com

<START>[Q3870|[Q3870|NAIROBI], [Q114|Kenya]], [DATETIME|Aug. 11] ([Q493845|UPI]) -- Once [Q84|London] [Q22656|oil] company [Q3541981|Tullow] starts drilling in [Q114|Kenya], the rest of the industry will take notice, a [Q114|[Q60723796|Kenyan]] [Unknown1|energy [Q599151|official]] said.

[Q114|[Q60723796|Kenyan]] [Unknown2|Petroleum Commissioner] [Unknown3|Martin Heya] told [Q14270642|Bloomberg News] that [Q3541981|Tullow] was planning [QUANTITY|two] test wells in northern [Q114|Kenya] [DATETIME|this year]. [Unknown4|Energy explorer] [Q119991|Apache Corp.] might follow suit off [Q114|Kenya]'s coast in [DATETIME|2012], [COREF:Unknown3|he] added.

[Q3541981|Tullow Oil] announced in [DATETIME|May] that [COREF:Q3541981|it] signed a memorandum of understanding with [Q1036|Uganda] that lets [COREF:Q3541981|it] move forward with energy development in [COREF:Q1036|the country]. [Q114|Kenya], however, doesn't have proven reserves and the number of exploratory wells drilled in [COREF:Q114|the country] pales in comparison with [COREF:Q114|its] neighbors.<END>

Dragan Trajkov, an energy analyst at London's Renaissance Capital, told Bloomberg News that Tullow moving into Kenya could trigger more interest in the country's energy sector.

Heya added that now was the time to work on the country's fledgling energy sector before constitutional regulations become law.

"The level of activity is at a high and we think once Tullow starts drilling we must prepare ourselves for even more interest," he was quoted as saying. "The more wells that are drilled, the faster a discovery will be made."

Can I buy insurance to protect my investments beyond the £50k limit?

By Marc Shoffman for MailOnline


I want to make sure my investments are protected and I know that £50,000 of money invested with each investing platform or fund house is covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. But how can I protect amounts above this limit?

Mark Polson, of platform research business the lang cat, replies: Investments are 'insured" or protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.

The exact arrangements are complex, but broadly speaking the first £85,000 of any cash deposits in a savings account with a bank or building society are covered if it goes bust.

You only receive this £85,000 coverage once under each bank or building society's 'compensation licence', it is doubled to £170,000 for joint accounts. You can ask for information on how you are covered by the FSCS from your bank and get a full explanation of savings compensation here.

Under a separate part of the scheme you also get compensation cover for the first £50,000 of any investments. Remember this is not cover against you losing money if investments go down, ie your fund dips in value, it covers you against losses if the investment provider or platform goes bust.

This covers the companies who are holding investments on your behalf; it doesn't mean that if a firm you buy shares in goes bust you get your money back.

I've looked but can find no-one willing to offer this kind of insurance. In its absence and if you are concerned then you may wish to consider spreading investments around and holding no more than £50,000 with any one fund house or custodian.

Most fund houses and platforms will appoint another company known as a custodian to look after your money.

And that is important - a bit like different banking brands, sometimes behind the scenes different investment brands use the same custodian to hold your investments.

Broadly speaking, if your investment platform or provider gets into difficulties, you may face delays and frustration, but your money should be safe as it is held separate from the assets of the company itself.

A custodian provides this service; these are normally very large, highly regulated and financially stable organisations such as Bank of New York Mellon, Citibank and Deutsche Bank.

<START>For your money to disappear, it is the custodian who would need to fail rather than the business through which you transact investments.

So if the fund house, platform or custodian goes bust, you are covered by [Q1416205|FSCS] up to £[QUANTITY|50,000].

So in that situation, let's say you are with Platform Z, which uses custodian X, and you've asked them to buy Fund Y from [Q1435728|Fund Manager] W.<END>

If Fund Manager W goes bust you have FSCS cover to £50,000. Same for the custodian and for the platform. What you do not have is protection against Fund Y falling in value.

Motor racing-FIA returns entry fee paid by defunct...

By Reuters


LONDON, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Formula One's governing body has returned the entry fee paid a year ago by the now-defunct Manor team, the International Automobile Federation (FIA) said on Monday.

The FIA said on its website (www.fia.com) that it had decided to return the entry fee, less administrative costs, "to the entity within the Manor Group in administration as a gesture of goodwill to assist in payment of outstanding debts."

In order to appear on the provisional 2017 entry list, published last December, Manor would have had to pay $521,289 to the FIA -- a basic fee of $516,128 and $5,161 for the sole point the team scored in 2016.

The team went into administration in January, before the start of the season, and ceased trading.
