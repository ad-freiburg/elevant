**** ARTICLE #4: List of Via Rail rolling stock (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38629618) *****
List of Via Rail rolling stock

This is a list of past and present rolling stock owned and operated by Via Rail in Canada. Via Rail owns 78 locomotives and 396 passenger cars. The tables below list that equipment by type and include some information regarding previously-owned and operated equipment. When Via began operation in 1976–1978 it was with a collection of equipment inherited from the Canadian National Railway (CN) and Canadian Pacific Railway (CP). Much of this equipment remains in use today. Over the years Via has supplemented this initial fleet with new orders and with new acquisitions of secondhand equipment from other operators.

Via operates diesel locomotives exclusively. Its fleet of GMD F40PH-2s was recently modernized. The newer GE P42DCs are found only on Corridor services.

In December 2018, VIA Rail Canada ordered 32 trainsets - each powered by a Charger locomotive - from Siemens for use on the Québec City–Windsor Corridor.

<START>[Q876720:Via Rail|Via] inherited a diverse fleet of diesel locomotives from the [Q624798:Canadian National Railway|Canadian National] and [Q46974:Canadian Pacific Railway|Canadian Pacific Railways]. [COREF:Q876720:Via Rail|It] also received [QUANTITY|three] of the experimental [Q888445|[Q888445|UAC TurboTrain] gas-turbine trainsets]. Between [DATETIME|1980]–[DATETIME|1984] [Q688893|[Q333498:Bombardier|Bombardier]] delivered [QUANTITY|31] [Q891793|[Q891793|LRC] ("Light, Rapid, Comfortable") diesel locomotives] with matching cars. The last of [COREF:Q891793|these] was retired in [DATETIME|2002].

The core of [Q876720:Via Rail|Via]'s long-range fleet is a collection of streamlined equipment originally built by the [Q960308:Budd Company|Budd Company] for the [Q46974:Canadian Pacific Railway|Canadian Pacific Railway] in the [DATETIME|1950s]. These were rebuilt by [Q4744378:American Machine and Foundry|AMF] to use head end power and thus are often referred to as the "HEP" fleet.

[Q891793|LRC] was a series of lightweight diesel-powered passenger trains built by [Q688893|[Q333498:Bombardier|Bombardier]] that were used on short- to medium-distance inter-city service in the provinces of [Q1904:Ontario|Ontario] and [Q176:Quebec|Quebec]. The [Q891793|[Q891793|LRC] family] includes both locomotives and passenger carriages designed to work together, though the [QUANTITY|two] can be, and now are, used separately. The last locomotives were retired in [DATETIME|2001] but the coaches remain in service.<END>

The Renaissance fleet was originally built by Alstom in the mid-1990s for the proposed "Nightstar" overnight service between the United Kingdom and continental Europe via the Channel Tunnel. Via acquired the entire fleet in 2000 for C$130 million after the Nightstar concept was abandoned. The cars entered service in 2002. Presently, four sets are in service: two on the Ocean, overnight between Montreal and Halifax, and two in the corridor, between Ottawa and Quebec City.

The Budd Rail Diesel Car (RDC) is a self-propelled diesel multiple unit railcar. These were used extensively by both the Canadian National and Canadian Pacific Railways for outlying routes. Via currently rosters seven RDCs and contracted with Industrial Rail Services for C$12.6 million to refurbish and upgrade all six. The upgraded units would include new seating, wheelchair accessible washrooms, LED interior lighting, controls, wiring, heating, air conditioning systems, braking systems and rebuilt engines that meet Euro 2 standards. The rebuilt units have also been modified to remove the control cab from one end of each unit, so passengers are never required to pass through the cab when entering or exiting the train. Following the bankruptcy of IRSI, work rebuilding the RDCs was completed by Canadian Allied Diesel (CAD) at the IRSI facility in Moncton.

The 2018 Canadian federal budget included funding for the purchase of 32 trainsets to replace equipment used in Corridor service in Ontario and Quebec. With money allocated, Via issued a request for proposals in 2018, with delivery of the new rolling stock scheduled for 2022. In December 2018, VIA Rail Canada ordered 32 trainsets from Siemens for use on the Québec City–Windsor Corridor, at a cost of $989 million. Trainsets will be powered by diesel-electric Charger locomotives, with passenger car trainsets from the Siemens Viaggio Comfort family. Similar trainsets are in use with Railjet in Austria, and the Czech Republic, and Virgin Trains USA in Florida, USA.

USS John R. Pierce

USS "John R. Pierce" (DD-753), an , is the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for Lieutenant Commander John Reeves Pierce, who commanded , a transport submarine, which was lost during battle in January 1943. Lieutenant Commander Pierce was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross.

"John R. Pierce" was laid down by the Bethlehem Steel Co., Staten Island, New York on 24 March 1944 and launched on 1 September 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Mary Taylor Pierce, widow of Lieutenant Commander. Pierce. The ship was commissioned on 30 December 1944 at Brooklyn Navy Yard, Commander C. R. Simmers in command.

Following shakedown off Bermuda, "John R. Pierce" operated out of Norfolk, Virginia during the spring of 1945, training destroyer crews and conducting antisubmarine warfare (ASW) patrols along the eastern seaboard. She sailed on 17 June for duty in the Pacific, arrived Pearl Harbor on 6 July. Departing on 12 August as escort for an aircraft carrier-cruiser striking force sent to attack Wake Island, she was ordered to cease offensive operations on 15 August. She then proceeded via Eniwetok to Japan and arrived Wakayama, Honshū on 15 September as escort for a convoy of occupation troops. Crew members were the first Americans to enter Hiroshima after the atomic bomb attack.

For the next three months, she operated in the Japanese Inland Sea, covering occupation landings and assisting in the liberation of Allied POWs. She sailed on 21 December from Kure, Honshū, to Shanghai, China, to support the Chinese Nationalists in their conflict with the Communists for control of the mainland. She also conducted the "North China Omnibus Courier Run" between China and Korea until 6 March 1946, when she departed Qingdao, China, for the United States.

Arriving at San Francisco on 27 March, she deactivated 16 September. "John R. Pierce" then sailed for San Diego on 17 January 1947, decommissioned 24 January and entered the San Diego Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet on 1 May.

"John R. Pierce" recommissioned on 11 April 1949, Commander O. W. Goepner in command. Assigned to the Atlantic Fleet, she departed on 11 July for Norfolk. Arriving on 5 August, she commenced twelve months of Atlantic operations that extended from Greenland to the Panama Canal Zone. Under the command of Commander J. R. Wadleigh, she cleared Norfolk on 8 August 1950 for duty with the 6th Fleet. Before returning to the United States on 23 January 1951, she operated in the Mediterranean from Gibraltar to Crete and along the western coast of Europe from England to Norway.

For more than 15 months, "John R. Pierce" operated out of Norfolk along the Atlantic coast; then she departed on 15 May 1952 for duty in the Far East. Sailing via the Panama Canal, San Diego and Pearl Harbor, she arrived Yokosuka, Japan on 18 June. With Commander O. C. Foote, Jr. in command, she sailed on 20 June for blockade and bombardment operations against Communist forces along the east coast of Korea. From Chongjin to Songjin, she conducted interdiction firing and "anti-mine, anti-junk and anti-fishing" patrols. While engaging enemy shore batteries at Songjin on 6 August, she sustained three hits from enemy fire, but continued interdiction patrols until 11 October. She then departed for the United States via the Indian Ocean, Suez and Gibraltar, arriving Norfolk 12 December.

From 5 January 1954 to 1 April 1962 "John R. Pierce" deployed to the Mediterranean on six cruises of varying duration. When not conducting operations with the 6th Fleet, she operated out of her home port on training exercises and readiness operations in the Atlantic and the Caribbean. When in the Mediterranean, fleet operations carried her the length and breadth of the sea, and deployments in 1954 and 1956 sent her, in addition, to the coast of Western Europe.

On 1 October 1956, 75 miles south of Villefranche, the ship was on aerial gunnery exercise firing at a towed aerial target, when at 0950, a shell exploded in the breech of mount 53, killing a member of the mount and seriously wounding nine others. Three of the injured were in grave condition and later died. Doctors from were taken by helicopter to the destroyer, and then transferred the wounded to the cruiser at sea. Then, "Salem" took the men to Villefranche to be transported to Nice Airport, France, where a C-119 Flying Boxcar waited to fly them to a military hospital in Frankfurt, Germany. One of the seriously wounded was Ensign John T. Pierce, son of John R. Pierce, for whom the ship was named. After the wounded were transferred, "John R. Pierce" went to Cannes, France and arrived on 2 October. She stayed there until 15 October and then got under way for the states. She refueled at São Miguel in the Azores on 20 October and again in Bermuda on 25 October, arriving in Norfolk on 27 October. From there, she went to the Philadelphia Naval Yard for repairs.

**** ARTICLE #7: Ray Dixon (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34367747) *****
Ray Dixon

Ray Dixon is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera "EastEnders", played by Chucky Venn. Ray is an ex-partner of character Bianca Butcher (Patsy Palmer) and the father of her son Morgan Butcher (Devon Higgs). He made his first on screen appearance on 10 January 2012. His storylines have involved meeting and getting to know Morgan, a relationship with Kim Fox (Tameka Empson) and starting a youth mentoring scheme. On 16 April 2013 it was announced that Venn had been written out of the show, and departed on 28 May 2013. He appeared in 107 episodes.

Ray is first mentioned in the episode broadcast on 9 January 2012, when Morgan asks about his father and Bianca says it is Barack Obama. Bianca's adopted daughter, Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), knowing the truth, attempts to contact Ray. Whitney takes Morgan to meet Ray the next day, and he soon comes to Walford to see Morgan. He saves Kim Fox (Tameka Empson) from a falling ladder, and she is attracted to him. Bianca soon realises that Whitney has taken Morgan to meet Ray, but does not want them to see each other, and Kim is disappointed to learn that Ray has a son. Whitney soon convinces Bianca to let Morgan see Ray again. Ray returns shortly after, wanting to spend more time with his son and offering to cook a meal for Bianca's family, although when Ray reveals he has a daughter, Sasha Dixon (Rebecca Sanneh), Bianca throws him out. He successfully gets a job as a barman and chef at The Queen Victoria public house. On his first day, Sasha arrives meets Morgan and Kim. Ray asks Kim out on a date, but Bianca is angry so takes Morgan out, and Kim tells Ray she has had enough of men with "baggage". Ray continues to pursue Kim but she insists she is busy. Ray tells Bianca he wishes he could have been there for Morgan and how he changed his priorities for Sasha. Bianca misreads his kindness and goes to kiss him, but he turns away. When Ray discovers that Bianca is struggling with money, he gives her £300, saying it is for back-payments for Morgan. He starts to get somewhere with Kim but she suddenly leaves. He later hears from Kim's sister Denise Fox (Diane Parish) that Kim has caught head lice, so he gives Kim a hat to wear and they finally kiss. Kim becomes jealous when Ray playfights with Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) and later when he flirts with Bianca. As a result, she accidentally slices off the top of Ray's finger when he tries to help her fillet some fish. She accompanies him to the hospital where they open up to one another and decide to start a relationship.

After Bianca is imprisoned, her mother Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson) decides to move with Bianca's children closer to the prison. Ray realises he cannot make Morgan choose between him and his mother, so allows him to leave. Ray then invites Sasha to stay with him, but Kim says she cannot take on his children. However, Kim is soon forced to look after Sasha, which pleases Ray. Kim and Ray then declare their love for one another. Ray is thrilled when Morgan returns for the wedding of his aunt, Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks). He bickers with Morgan's adoptive father, Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) over his parenting methods, but the pair reconcile when Morgan gets upset and Ray thanks Ricky for bringing Morgan up in his absence. Ray moves into Kim's bed and breakfast when his landlord increases his rent. Kim tells Sasha she can organise some work experience for her with a forensic scientist. She later admits this was a lie, leading to Ray moving out. Kim then gets Sasha a placement with Les Coker's (Roger Sloman) firm of funeral directors, and Ray and Kim make up. Ray becomes secretive and Kim suspects he is having an affair. She then finds information about local flats and assumes that Ray is looking for somewhere for them both to live. However, Ray reveals that the flat is for Sasha's mother, Deanne, so they can both be closer to Sasha. Kim feels upset and humiliated. However, he affirms his love for her and they reconcile.

Ray is angry when a police officer stops him, suspecting him of a mugging. Ray claims that the police officer is being racist, but feels he cannot do anything about it, until Kim and Denise urge him to become a mentor for children facing similar circumstances. With funding from Sport England, he successfully starts his mentoring scheme, "Fighting Fit", at the local boxing club. When Denise is feeling sad about being single, Ray compliments and kisses her. He thinks Denise has told Kim, so says Denise kissed him, leading to Kim and Denise falling out after Kim slaps her. Ray then ends his relationship with Kim, saying they are too different, but she continues to send text messages in the hope they will reconcile. Ray flirts with Kirsty Branning (Kierston Wareing), upsetting Kim. A few months later, Ray learns that Sasha's mother has been in an accident. Kim and Ray start talking when she asks a favour for her bed and breakfast, while he struggles to cope with caring for Sasha and working at the pub. Kim helps Ray by cooking him dinner, which leads to them kissing. They resume their relationship, but Ray decides to leave Walford and his job to be closer to Sasha. Kim agrees to come with him, but at her birthday party, she realises that Ray does not know her very well, so she breaks up with him moments before they are due to leave together, and Ray leaves alone.

Venn heard from a friend that "EastEnders" were looking to cast Ray, and said that he thought "I could play that guy!" so contacted his agent to be put forward for the part. His agent told him that the producers were already interested in him for the part. Venn had previously worked with actor Jamie Foreman, who plays Derek Branning in the series, and when he discovered that Foreman was a part of the show, it made him more determined to get the part of Ray. He prepared 12 pages of his own back story for the character and imagined Ray's life as a child. Venn was eventually cast in the series, and was contracted for six months. Venn started filming in November 2011. The character and casting were then announced on 15 November 2011. Venn was a fan of "EastEnders" since he was about 12 years old, so he felt it was "a real privilege to now be a part of television history." He said of his casting, "I have had the pleasure of working on many great productions with fantastic artistes such as Morgan Freeman and I have to say working on "EastEnders" feels like it is up there with the best of them. "EastEnders" is etched in British history and it is an honour and a pleasure to be part of it." The first scenes that Venn filmed were with Shona McGarty (Whitney Dean), and Venn stated that it felt like "the first day at school".

Ray is a former army soldier, which Venn said taught him "discipline and how to handle himself in certain situations." He also said it makes Ray "strategic and tactical". Venn hoped that Ray's army past would catch up with him in a storyline. Venn has described him as "a noble fella" and "a man of principles [who] wants to honour his parental duties to the end, no matter what." He also said "Ray's a very honourable man, and committed to his children." Additionally, when Venn auditioned for the part, the character was pitched to him as "a charming family man and someone the ladies admire." Ray is described as "a good guy" who enjoys the gym, the pub and watching football matches. He had a hard childhood, but was loved by his mother and grandparents. From his grandmother he gained a love of Caribbean food and from his grandfather he took "a special kind of optimism". He got a girl from his estate pregnant before joining the army, which resulted in the birth of his daughter Sasha Dixon. Ray sees Sasha as "being the best thing in his life, but he wishes her mother didn't exist." Ray works as a pub chef, which he has done in various cities. He has no problems with women but is described as "a love 'em and leave 'em type." "Inside Soap" called him "cocky".

Ray and Bianca had a relationship when she was living in Manchester, and he fell in love with her but it ended when she met Tony King and stole money from Ray. Bianca never told Ray that she had become pregnant by him. A source from "EastEnders" confirmed: "Ray hasn't seen Bianca for years and they didn't part on good terms. He meets Whitney as he has matters with Bianca that are unresolved. But Ray gets the shock of his life when Whitney tells him all about Morgan—and she soon realises that Ray knew nothing about his son." Ray's introduction to "EastEnders" was said to fill "another piece of the puzzle" of Bianca's life, as previously nothing about Morgan's paternity was known. The relationship between Ray and Bianca was described as "fraught". Venn described the relationship as "fiery" and explained that Ray respects Bianca, and said that there was a possibility of them reuniting. Venn told "All About Soap" that when Ray meets Morgan for the first time, he has mixed emotions because although he has met his son, Morgan does not know who he is, and thinks he is meeting Barack Obama. Venn opined that it would be "cathartic" for Ray, saying he would be sad as he has missed out on seven years of Morgan's life, and said that when they first meet, "it's a lovely moment [for] the two of them". An "EastEnders" insider explained that Ray is desperate to be a part of Morgan's life, and would do whatever it takes to be with him, even move to Albert Square, where Morgan's family are. Venn opined that Ray would strive to be a good father, saying "[he]'d take his parental responsibilities very seriously". After Bianca goes to prison in May 2012, Venn told "Inside Soap" that "Ray will do everything in his power to keep Morgan in his life".

Discussing the storyline in which Ray asks Kim out on a date but she plays hard to get, an "EastEnders" insider told the "Daily Star Sunday" that "Kim absolutely fancies the pants off Ray but she's got to calm herself down. She wants to get this one right so she decides the best way is to play hard to get. Ray sees straight through her and rather enjoys winding her up. She's a little firecracker as far as he's concerned and he likes it. These two are going to provide quite a bit of comedy as they get to know each other. Kim believes it's her destiny to have a fit man on her arm and she may well have met her match in Ray. It's going to be a fun few weeks for her and everyone is excited at the prospect of these two becoming a couple. They have real on-screen chemistry." Kim plays hard to get with Ray for a number of weeks, until Ray admits his feelings for her in scenes broadcast in April 2012. Up until then, they argue a lot, which a writer for "All About Soap" insisted was sexual tension. An "EastEnders" insider told "Inside Soap", "Pairing up Kim and Ray initially creates fireworks of entirely the wrong kind! But there's definitely something there, and [their colleagues] can see plain as day that they're meant to be together." Venn said in May 2012 that pairing up Kim and Ray creates "a dynamic comedic duo [which] brings comedic spice to the show."

Empson said in a May 2012 interview with "Inside Soap" that Kim did not consider Ray's children when she started flirting with him, but "She's been very honest with him about her feelings. but if you really like somebody, then you have to take the whole package." She went on to say that Kim and Ray "make a good couple" and that "Kim wants a bit of security, and her own family. Ray's a man's man, and she really thinks he could be a long-term love for her. That's why she did things differently with him, and didn't rush in. [...] With Ray, she's keeping her cards very close to her chest." Continuing, she explained that Ray is "something different" for Kim because he's "a decent guy", adding "I think she and Ray really complement each other—he's livened up a bit by her, while she learns a lot from him." Finally, she said that Ray likes that Kim is "her own woman. So together they made a really good team. Someone once said that Kim and Ray are like the Posh and Becks of Walford." Venn said that he thought it was "nice" for Ray to propose marriage to Kim, saying, "I imagine they would have a conventional wedding, then a reception with 70s fancy dress. [...] I'm sure nothing would be straightforward." He also said he would like to see them have a baby together, as it would be "interesting to see how Kim tackled being a mother." Empson said that if they were to get engaged, Kim would need a big ring, and Venn teased that Ray may have got the ring, since viewers were to see "the other side of Ray".

<START>In [DATETIME|December 2012], pictures emerged in the press of [Q6100764:|Ray] kissing [Q6408627:Kim Fox|Kim]'s sister [Q5257665:Denise Fox|Denise Fox] ([Q2215497:Diane Parish|Diane Parish]). It was unknown at the time if it would lead to a relationship or remain a one-off. [Q5115892:Chucky Venice|Venn] praised the storyline, saying "Obviously it's about layers and showing the different sides of [COREF:Q5115892:Chucky Venice|my] character, so for [COREF:Q5115892:Chucky Venice|me], this is a wonderful challenge. As an [Q33999|actor], [COREF:Q5115892:Chucky Venice|I] love challenges so [COREF:Q5115892:Chucky Venice|I]'m looking forward to seeing how this storyline develops. [COREF:Q5115892:Chucky Venice|I] think [Q6408627:Kim Fox|Kim] would be quite peeved if [COREF:Q6408627:Kim Fox|she] found out!" [Q5115892:Chucky Venice|Venn] explained [Q6100764:|Ray]'s reasons for kissing [Q5257665:Denise Fox|Denise], saying, "[Q6100764:|Ray] reaches a point where [COREF:Q6100764:|he] needs to come up for a breath of air, as there's only so much of [Q6408627:Kim Fox|Kim]'s heightened personality [COREF:Q6100764:|he] can bear. Did [Q6100764:|Ray] go for the wrong sister? Who knows? [COREF:Q6100764:|He] probably has more in common with [Q5257665:Denise Fox|Denise] than [COREF:Q6100764:|he] ever had with [Q6408627:Kim Fox|Kim]." [COREF:Q5115892:Chucky Venice|He] said that [COREF:Q5115892:Chucky Venice|he] felt bad about [Q6100764:|Ray] kissing [Q5257665:Denise Fox|Denise] because [COREF:Q5115892:Chucky Venice|he] is close to [Q6138516:Tameka Empson|Empson] and [DESC:Q6408627|[COREF:Q6138516:Tameka Empson|her] character] has been [Q6100764:|Ray]'s partner for about [QUANTITY|10] to [QUANTITY|11] months, and said it was "really weird" to film the kiss with [Q5257665:Denise Fox|Denise]. The kiss, shown in [DATETIME|January 2013], leads to [Q6100764:|Ray] and [Q6408627:Kim Fox|Kim]'s relationship ending.

In an early storyline, [Q6100764:|Ray] takes a disliking to [Q5261834:Derek Branning|Derek Branning] ([Q182743:Jamie Foreman|Jamie Foreman]) when [COREF:Q5261834:Derek Branning|he] stores illegal [Q154|alcohol] in the basement of [Q7758998:The Queen Victoria|The Queen Victoria]. In [DATETIME|May 2012], [Q5115892:Chucky Venice|Venn] opined that tension between [Q5261834:Derek Branning|Derek] and [Q6100764:|Ray] "could come to a head at some point soon. There's only so much one man can take, especially when it comes to racial abuse. [[Q6100764:|Ray] will] know exactly when to attack, and won't hold back." [Q5115892:Chucky Venice|Venn] also said [COREF:Q5115892:Chucky Venice|he] could imagine [DESC:Unknown2|[Unknown1:|Sasha]'s mother] appearing on screen, saying, ""[Q607514:EastEnders|EastEnders]" likes to keep you guessing, and [COREF:Q5115892:Chucky Venice|I] think that's a storyline with legs."

In [DATETIME|June 2012], it was announced that [Q3955054:Kat Slater|Kat Moon], played by [Q5929775:Jessie Wallace|Jessie Wallace], would embark on a long-running mystery affair with another [Q4711261:|Albert Square] resident. The identity of the mystery man was kept secret from both cast and crew, as well as viewers, and all scenes of [Q3955054:Kat Slater|Kat] with [COREF:Q3955054:Kat Slater|her] lover were filmed with an [Q658371|extra]. After the storyline was announced, [Q6100764:|Ray] was announced as [QUANTITY|one] of [QUANTITY|five] suspects as potential love interests for [Q3955054:Kat Slater|Kat], along with, [Q6012848:Michael Moon|Michael Moon] ([Q7612948:Steve John Shepherd|Steve John Shepherd]), [Q6794615:Max Branning|Max Branning] ([Q3075458:Jake Wood|Jake Wood]), [Q5261834:Derek Branning|Derek Branning] ([Q182743:Jamie Foreman|Jamie Foreman]) and [Q9010450:Jack Branning|Jack Branning] ([Q2260957:Scott Maslen|Scott Maslen]). Speaking of the storyline, [Q1053574|executive producer] [Q6681665:Lorraine Newman|Lorraine Newman] said: "The consequences are not only great for [Q3955054:Kat Slater|Kat] and [Q4721932:Alfie Moon|Alfie], but also for each individual suspect. The audience will join the cast and crew guessing across the [Q1313|summer] and [Q1314|autumn] as we eliminate the suspects [QUANTITY|one] at a time, leading to [QUANTITY|one] almighty explosion." Asked about the possibility that [Q6100764:|Ray] could be [Q3955054:Kat Slater|Kat]'s lover, [Q5115892:Chucky Venice|Venn] said that "[Q3955054:Kat Slater|Kat]'s a saucy minx, and what man wouldn't want to get involved with [COREF:Q3955054:Kat Slater|her]? [Q6100764:|Ray] is a loyal, caring father—but we all have our dark sides. There's a lot the audience hasn't seen yet, put it that way." [Unknown3:|Daniel Kilkelly] from entertainment website [Q1111380:Digital Spy|Digital Spy] said that [Q6100764:|Ray] appears to be a "decent family guy" and may not be the top suspect, but [COREF:Q6100764:|he] is very flirtatious and [COREF:Q6100764:|his] [Q3499072|[Q156839|chef]]'s job in [Q7758998:The Queen Victoria|The Queen Victoria], where [Q3955054:Kat Slater|Kat] is [Q618532|landlady], would give [COREF:Q6100764:|him] the perfect opportunity. However, [COREF:Unknown3:|he] questioned the likelihood of [Q6100764:|Ray] cheating on [Q6408627:Kim Fox|Kim]. [Q6100764:|Ray] was eliminated as a suspect in the episode broadcast on [DATETIME|7 August 2012], when [COREF:Q6100764:|he] catches [Q3955054:Kat Slater|Kat] on the phone to [COREF:Q3955054:Kat Slater|her] lover.<END>

In September 2012, viewers see Ray become a victim of racial profiling by the police, and Kim suggests that Ray channel his negativity into mentoring youths. Venn spoke on "This Morning", confirming that Ray would indeed start such a scheme. Venn praised the storyline and the fact that the character could show a more serious side, saying, "For me, of course, I was very impressed by "EastEnders" for even making the choice to tackle such a pertinent, very relevant issue. It felt very close to my heart." He went on to say that Ray would "help empower [youths], so they can equip themselves in situations similar to that—[to have] a bit more self-respect, know how to carry themselves and not deal with it in a violent or aggressive manner." Venn then stated that the storyline could establish Ray as "a more well-rounded character", saying, "It's about levels. There's different sides to every individual. It's nice that "EastEnders" have given me the opportunity to allow Ray to show the other sides. It just shows versatility."

On 16 April 2013, it was announced that Venn was leaving the show, with Ray making his final appearance in May, as producers had decided to write him out. Venn stated: "Working on "EastEnders" has been one of my career highlights and an invaluable experience. I couldn't have asked for a better team to work with and have found a lifelong friend in my on-screen partner Tameka [Empson]. I want to thank everyone who supported me on the show."

Initial praise for Ray was based on his looks. A writer for "All About Soap" magazine described Ray as "hunky", "good-looking" and said that "this mysterious man might have everything going for him." Laura Morgan of "All About Soap" said that Ray's inclusion "ticks the hunky-man box very nicely". In a feature about "the boys of soapland who'll be lighting up our screens in the coming months", a writer for "Inside Soap" said in May 2012, "It's rare to meet a truly good man in soap. They generally come laden with baggage, burdened with dark secrets and—almost always—have the same attitude to monogamy as a cocker spaniel on heat. But Ray seems to be cut from a different cloth, and we love him for it."

In May 2012, Venn was nominated in the Best Newcomer category at the 2012 TVChoice Awards for his portrayal of Ray, but was not shortlisted for the award. He was then nominated in July 2012 for Best Newcomer at the 2012 Inside Soap awards.

Hearts and Flowers

"Hearts and Flowers" (subtitle: "A New Flower Song") is a song composed by Theodore Moses-Tobani (with words by Mary D. Brine) and published in 1893 by Carl Fischer Music.

<START>The famous melody is taken from the introductory 2/4 section of ""[Unknown1:|Wintermärchen" Waltzes Op. 366]" ([DATETIME|1891]) by the [Q28:Hungary|[Q133032|Hungarian]] [Q36834|composer] [Q447124:Alphons Czibulka|Alphons Czibulka]. [Q2525641:Theodore Moses Tobani|Tobani] arranged [COREF:Unknown1:|the piece] in a 4/4 song form as "[Q5692979:Hearts and Flowers|Hearts and Flowers, a New Flower Song, Op. 245.]" [COREF:Q5692979:Hearts and Flowers|The song] as a vocal number was soon forgotten but the instrumental version gained popularity in its own right and it is in this form that [COREF:Q5692979:Hearts and Flowers|it] remains well known to this day. [Q2525641:Theodore Moses Tobani|Tobani] also arranged [COREF:Q5692979:Hearts and Flowers|the tune] as a [Q8701407:waltz|waltz], featured in a medley published in [DATETIME|1900] entitled "[Unknown2:|Beauties Charms,]" although [COREF:Unknown2:|this arrangement] is now seldom heard.

"[Q5692979:Hearts and Flowers|Hearts and Flowers]" has an association in popular culture as [Q191489|melodramatic] [Q7187883:|photoplay music]. The practice of using the selection as a dramatic cue is documented as early as [DATETIME|1911], although complaints that [COREF:Q5692979:Hearts and Flowers|the tune] was becoming overplayed crop up as early as [DATETIME|1913] and [DATETIME|1914], and by [DATETIME|1915], [COREF:Q5692979:Hearts and Flowers|the piece] was being called "time worn".

Soon thereafter, "[Q5692979:Hearts and Flowers|Hearts and Flowers]" (along with [Q653501:Gustav Lange|Gustav Lange]'s "[Unknown3:|Flower Song]") became more commonly associated with underscoring an over-the-top [Q170539|parody] of [Q191489|melodrama] in film. Around [DATETIME|1919], musical accompaniment cue sheets start suggesting [COREF:Q5692979:Hearts and Flowers|the tune] "a la [Q217117|burlesque]" to mock-dramatic scenes. Even into the late [DATETIME|1920s], "[Q5692979:Hearts and Flowers|Hearts and Flowers]" continued to be suggested as a [Q217117|burlesque] dramatic piece.<END>

"Hearts and Flowers" was not only heard in theater as accompaniment to films, but played an integral part of on-set music for actors. Viola Dana famously requested the tune to be played in order for her to generate enough emotion for her to cry real tears. This was later parodied in the 1928 film "Show People" with Marion Davies.

The term 'hearts-and-flowers' has entered the English language with the sense "extreme sentimentality, cloying sweetness".

There is a reference to "Hearts and Flowers" in "Amazing Spider-Man" #45, published February, 1967.


**** ARTICLE #9: Foreign relations of Poland (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23024) *****
Foreign relations of Poland

The Republic of Poland is a Central European country and member of the European Union and NATO, among others. Poland wields considerable influence in Central and Eastern Europe and is a middle power in international affairs. The foreign policy of Poland is based on four basic commitments: to Atlantic co-operation, to European integration, to international development and to international law.

The Polish economy is fairly open and relies strongly on international trade. Since the collapse of communism and its re-establishment as a democratic nation, Poland has extended its responsibilities and position in European and Western affairs, supporting and establishing friendly foreign relations with both the West and with numerous European countries.

After regaining independence in 1989, Poland has forged ahead on its economic reintegration with the Western world. Poland also has been an active nation in advocating European integration.

In 1994, Poland became an associate member of the European Union (EU) and its defensive arm, the Western European Union (WEU). In 1996, Poland achieved full OECD membership and submitted preliminary documentation for full EU membership. In 1997, Poland was invited in the first wave of NATO policy enlargement at the July 1997 NATO Summit in Madrid, Spain. In March 1999, Poland became a full member of NATO. Poland promoted its NATO candidacy through energetic participation in the Partnership for Peace (PfP) program and through intensified individual dialogue with NATO. Poland formally joined the European Union in May 2004, along with the other members of the Visegrád group.

[Q36:Poland|Poland] has actively pursued good relations with all [COREF:Q36:Poland|its] neighboring countries, signing friendship treaties replacing links severed by the collapse of the [Q41644:Warsaw Pact|Warsaw Pact]. The [Q36:Poland|Poles] have forged special relationships with [Q37:Lithuania|Lithuania] and particularly [Q212:Ukraine|Ukraine] in an effort to firmly anchor these states to [Q160381|the [Q160381|West]].

Due to [COREF:Q36:Poland|its] tragic historical experience with aggression of powerful neighbors (e.g., [Q152006:Partitions of Poland|Partitions of Poland], [Q362:World War II|Second World War]), [Q36:Poland|Polish] foreign policy pursues close cooperation with a strong partner, one apt enough to give strong military support in times of critical situations. This creates the background of [Q36:Poland|Poland]'s tight relations with [Q30|the [Q30:United States of America|USA]] and [COREF:Q36:Poland|their] sensitivity in relations towards [COREF:Q36:Poland|its] partner within the [Q458:European Union|European Union], [Q183:Germany|Germany]. At the same time, the equally burdened attitude towards [Q159:Russia|Russia] results in very tense diplomatic relations, which have been constantly worsening since [Q7747:Vladimir Putin|Vladimir Putin]'s rise to power. This is an important factor for the special attention [Q36:Poland|Poland] pays to the political emancipation of all [COREF:Q36:Poland|its] Eastern neighbors: [Q37:Lithuania|Lithuania], [Q184:Belarus|Belarus] and [Q212:Ukraine|Ukraine].<END>

**** ARTICLE #17: Rock of the Westies (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1203988) *****
Rock of the Westies

Rock of the Westies is the tenth studio album by English musician Elton John, released in October 1975. As with "Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy", "Rock of the Westies" debuted on the US "Billboard" 200 chart at No. 1, the only two albums at that time to have done so. It was also successful (albeit to a lesser extent) in the artist's home territory of the UK, where it reached No. 5 on the UK Albums Chart. Robert Christgau ranked it as No. 7 on his list of the best albums of 1975. The title is a spoonerism play on the phrase "West of the Rockies", the album having been recorded at Caribou Ranch in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado.

"Rock of the Westies" contained the US No. 1 (#14 UK) single, "Island Girl", which was released prior to the album. John noted at the time in a radio interview that he had wanted to release "Dan Dare (Pilot of the Future)" as the album's first single instead of "Island Girl", because he thought it had more commercial appeal. He was over-ruled, and "Dan Dare" was never released as a single, whilst "Island Girl" became a hit.

The make-up of John's band was different on "Rock of the Westies", being without his long-time drummer Nigel Olsson and bassist Dee Murray, both of whom John fired during April 1975. Added in their place were drummer Roger Pope, an old friend who had played on "Empty Sky", "Tumbleweed Connection" and "Madman Across the Water", and American bassist Kenny Passarelli, who had previously played with Stephen Stills and was an original member in Joe Walsh's band Barnstorm. Pope had also played in Kiki Dee's touring band. Grammy, Emmy, and Academy Award-nominated James Newton-Howard, at the time a virtual unknown, was also brought in as keyboardist, giving him his first major publicity. Also included was Caleb Quaye, another old friend from his early DJM session days. Like Pope, Quaye had also played on "Empty Sky" & "Tumbleweed Connection" & also John's intervening eponymous release. Retained from the previous line-up were Davey Johnstone and Ray Cooper.

A slower, less up-tempo version of "Hard Luck Story" had already been recorded by Kiki Dee (whom the song was originally written for), and released as a single one year prior to its recording for "Rock of the Westies". Along with "Don't Go Breaking My Heart", it is credited to Ann Orson/Carte Blanche (An 'orse an' cart / 'carte blanche') a punning moniker John devised when composing a song (music and lyrics) on his own. The name Ann Orson is also used as the name of a backing vocalist. Labelle performed backing vocals on the opening track, "Medley: Yell Help/Wednesday Night/Ugly".

**** ARTICLE #21: Forage War (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5724586) *****
Forage War

The Forage War was a partisan campaign consisting of numerous small skirmishes that took place in New Jersey during the American Revolutionary War between January and March 1777, following the battles of Trenton and Princeton. After both British and Continental Army troops entered their winter quarters in early January, Continental Army regulars and militia companies from New Jersey and Pennsylvania engaged in numerous scouting and harassing operations against the British and German troops quartered in New Jersey.

The British troops wanted to have fresh provisions to consume, and also required fresh forage for their draft animals and horses. General George Washington ordered the systematic removal of such supplies from areas easily accessible to the British, and companies of American militia and troops harassed British and German forays to acquire such provisions. While many of these operations were small, in some cases they became quite elaborate, involving more than 1,000 troops. The American operations were so successful that British casualties in New Jersey (including those of the battles at Trenton and Princeton) exceeded those of the entire campaign for New York.

In August 1776 the British army began a campaign to gain control over New York City, which was defended by George Washington's Continental Army. Over the next two months, General William Howe quickly gained control of New York, pushing Washington into New Jersey. He then chased Washington south toward Philadelphia. Washington retreated across the Delaware River into Pennsylvania, taking with him all the boats for miles in each direction. Howe then ordered his army into winter quarters, establishing a chain of outposts across New Jersey, from the Hudson River through New Brunswick to Trenton and Bordentown on the Delaware River. The occupation of New Jersey by British and German troops caused friction with the local communities and led to a rise in Patriot militia enlistments. As early as mid-December, these militia companies were harassing British patrols, leading to incidents like Geary's ambush, in which a dragoon leader was killed, and increasing the level of tension in the British and German quarters.

On the night of December 25–26, 1776, Washington crossed the Delaware and surprised the Trenton outpost the following morning, December 26. Over the next two weeks, he went on to win two further battles at Assunpink Creek and Battle of Princeton, leading the British to retreat to northern New Jersey. This period, from December 25, 1776, through January 3, 1777, has become known as the Ten Crucial Days.

General Washington established his headquarters at Morristown, separated from the coast by the Watchung Mountains, a series of low ridges. He established forward outposts to the east and south of these ridges that served not only as a defensive bulwark against potential British incursions across the hills, but also as launch points for raids. Over the course of January and February, Washington's Continental Army shrank to about 2,500 regulars after Washington's incentives for many men to overstay their enlistment periods ran out. A large number of militia from New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania bolstered these forces, and played a significant role that winter.

The British army was initially deployed from posts as far north as Hackensack to New Brunswick. The garrison, numbering about 10,000, was concentrated between New Brunswick and Amboy, with a sizable contingent farther north, from Elizabethtown to Paulus Hook. Militia pressure in January led General Cornwallis to withdraw most of the northern troops to the shores of the Hudson. The resulting concentration of troops overflowed the available housing, which had been entirely abandoned by its residents, with some of the troops even living aboard ships anchored nearby; the cramped quarters led to an increase in camp-related illnesses throughout the winter, and morale was low. The area had been heavily plundered during the American retreat in the fall, so there was little in the way of local provisions. The men subsisted largely on rations such as salt pork, but their draft animals required fresh fodder, for which they sent out raiding expeditions.

Early in the winter, Washington sent out detachments of troops to systematically remove any remaining provisions and livestock from convenient access by the British. General Cornwallis sent out small foraging and raiding parties in January. These were met by larger formations (numbering 300 and up) of American militia companies, sometimes with Continental Army support, that led on occasion to significant casualties. In one early example, Brigadier General Philemon Dickinson mustered 450 militia and drove off a British foraging expedition in the Battle of Millstone on January 20. Washington gave his commanders wide latitude in how to act, issuing commands that they were to be "constantly harassing the enemy", and that they should be aggressive in their tactics. These early successes depended in part on successful intelligence; one British commander reported being met with force "notwithstanding the Orders were given, but a few hours before the Troops moved." Even supply convoys bringing provisions from outside the state to the large garrison at New Brunswick were not immune to the American attacks, where the Raritan River and the roads from Perth Amboy offered opportunities for sniping and raiding. Their difficulties led British commanders to change tactics, attempting to lure these militia units into traps involving larger numbers of British regulars.

But even this was not entirely successful, as wily militia and Continental commanders including Continental Army General William Maxwell used superior knowledge of the geography to set even more elaborate traps. In one encounter in late February, British Colonel Charles Mawhood, thinking he had flanked a party of New Jersey militia, suddenly found his advance force flanked by another, larger force. As they were driven back toward Amboy, more and more Americans appeared, ultimately inflicting about 100 casualties. The elite grenadiers of the 42nd Foot, part of Mawhood's vanguard, were badly mauled in the encounter. A British force of 2,000 was repulsed by Maxwell in another well-organized attack a few weeks later.

<START>The ongoing tensions took their toll on the beleaguered [Q161885:Great Britain|[Q842438|British]]. [Q68188:Johann von Ewald|Johann Ewald], [Q19100|captain] of a company of [Q315316|[Q42884:Germans|German] [Q315316:jäger|jägers]] (essentially [Q1598759|light infantry]) who were often on the front lines, observed that "the men have to stay dressed day and night ... the horses constantly saddled", and that "the army would have been gradually destroyed through this foraging". Some forage was provided from [Q1384:New York|New York], but it was never sufficient for the army's needs. As a consequence, the [Q161885:Great Britain|[Q842438|British]] were forced to provide many supplies from [Q46:Europe|Europe], at great cost and risk to the [Q172771:Royal Navy|Royal Navy].

A regiment of [Q165763:Waldeck|Waldeck] [Q29171|infantry], a few companies of the [Q4643099:|71st Foot] and a troop of [Q161885:Great Britain|[Q842438|British]] [Unknown1|light dragoons] were stationed at [Q138311:Elizabeth|[Q138311|Elizabethtown], [Q1408|New Jersey]] in the [Q1311|winter] of [DATETIME|1776]–[DATETIME|1777]. On [DATETIME|5 January 1777], a [Q161885:Great Britain|[Q842438|British]] [Q47315|cavalry] patrol was ambushed by [Q16933808|[Q6857899|militia]] near [COREF:Q138311:Elizabeth|the town]. [QUANTITY|One] [Q3540989|trooper] was killed and a [QUANTITY|second] was wounded. [DATETIME|The next day], about [QUANTITY|50] [Q165763:Waldeck|Waldeck] [Q29171|infantry] emerged from [COREF:Q138311:Elizabeth|the town] with a small escort of [Unknown1|light dragoons] with instructions to clear the country. Led by [Unknown2|[Q19100|Captain] [Unknown2:|Georg von Haacke]], the strong patrol was attacked near [Q1086154:Springfield Township|Springfield] by [Q16932993|[Q1408:New Jersey|New Jersey] [Q16933808|[Q6857899|militia]]]. In [Q138311:Elizabeth|Elizabethtown], the [Q4991371|soldiers] heard distant gunfire. Hours later the bedraggled [Q161885:Great Britain|[Q842438|British]] [Q47315|horsemen] came back without the [Q29171|foot soldiers]. [QUANTITY|Eight] or [QUANTITY|10] of the [Q165763:Waldeck|Waldeckers] were shot down and the entire party captured by [COREF:Q16932993|the [Q16933808|[Q6857899|militia]]]. Ordered to pull back to [Q985592:Perth Amboy|Amboy], the garrison hurriedly left on [DATETIME|7 January]. As the troops evacuated [Q138311:Elizabeth|Elizabethtown], [COREF:Q16932993|the [Q16933808|[Q6857899|militia]]] attacked the rear guard. In the confused retreat, the [Q30:United States of America|[Q846570|Americans]] captured [QUANTITY|100] [Q4991371|soldiers], the baggage trains of [QUANTITY|two] regiments, and food supplies. 

On [DATETIME|10 January 1777], [Q735235|[Q104680|Colonel] [Q735235:Charles Scott|Charles Scott]]'s [Q7934382|[Q1370:Virginia|Virginia] [Q54122:Continental Army|Continentals]] captured [QUANTITY|70] [Unknown3:|Highlanders] together with [COREF:Unknown3:|their] wagons at [Q1088995:Chatham, New Jersey|[Q1088995|Chatham], [Q1408|New Jersey]]. [Q735235:Charles Scott|Scott]'s brigade was composed of the [Q4639489:|4th], [Q4641479:|5th] and [Q4642825:|6th Virginia Regiments]. At [Q1089738:Union Township|Connecticut Farms] on [DATETIME|15 January], [QUANTITY|300] [Q16932993|[Q1408:New Jersey|New Jersey] [Q153936|[Q16933808|[Q6857899|militia]]]] commanded by [Q7087840|[Q104680|Colonel] [Q7087840:Oliver Spencer|Oliver Spencer]] attacked [QUANTITY|100] [Q42884:Germans|German] foragers. The [Q30:United States of America|[Q846570|Americans]] killed [QUANTITY|one] enemy [Q4991371|soldier] and captured [QUANTITY|70] more. [DATETIME|The following day], [QUANTITY|350] [Q30:United States of America|[Q846570|Americans]] set upon a large body of [Q161885:Great Britain|[Q842438|British]] foragers at [Q4941953:Bonhamtown|[Q4941953|Bonhamtown], [Q1408|New Jersey]], killing [QUANTITY|21] enemy [Q4991371|soldiers] and wounding [QUANTITY|30] or [QUANTITY|40] more. [Q30:United States of America|[Q846570|American]] casualties are not given in any of these actions. <END>

At the Battle of Millstone, Brigadier General Philemon Dickinson of the New Jersey militia scored a brilliant success. On 20 January 1777 near Van Nest's Mill, 400 militia and 50 Pennsylvania riflemen crossed an icy stream and fought a pitched battle with 500 British regulars and three cannons. The British lost 25 casualties, 12 prisoners, 43 wagons, 104 horses, 115 cattle and about 60 sheep. The Americans admitted losses of four or five men. Afterward, the British refused to believe that they had been beaten by militia. On 23 January two British regiments were waylaid by Brigadier General William Maxwell near Woodbridge. The 200 New Jersey Continentals inflicted losses of seven killed and 12 wounded while only suffering two men wounded.

On 1 February 1777, Brigadier General Sir William Erskine, 1st Baronet set up a clever trap. He sent a party of foragers to Drake's Farm near Metuchen. When Scott's 5th Virginia tried to gobble up the small party, Erskine rushed his large force into action. Battalions of grenadiers, light infantry, 42nd Foot and Hessians appeared, supported by eight artillery pieces. Instead of fleeing, the Virginians launched a vicious attack which momentarily broke a grenadier battalion. Under intense cannon fire, the American attack was stopped, but the soldiers fought tenaciously until the British fell back toward Brunswick. The Americans admitted 30 to 40 casualties while claiming to have killed 36 British and wounding 100 more. The action was marred by an ugly incident when Lieutenant William Kelly and six other wounded Americans were abandoned during a tactical withdrawal. The frustrated British fell upon the seven helpless men with bayonets and musket butts and slaughtered them all. When the Americans recovered the mangled bodies they were infuriated. Brigadier General Adam Stephen exchanged a series of irate letters with Erskine, who denied all responsibility for the incident. 

On February 8, 1777, General Cornwallis, with six British generals commanding a force of twelve battalions, about 2,000 troops, planned to attack the American militia, led by Colonel Charles Scott and the 5th Virginia Regiment, and Continentals led by Brigadier General Nathaniel Warner at Quibbletown, New Jersey, now New Market. However, the Americans refused to directly engage this foraging party, but attacked the flanks and rear as the British retreated to New Brunswick. Historian Fischer writes: "The British commanders were outgeneraled in the field." Hessian Captain Johann von Ewald described the events in his diary and notes that "Since the army would have been gradually destroyed through this foraging, from here on the forage was procured from New York". Other skirmishes occurred in this area on February 20, March 8, and April 4.

On 23 February 1777, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Mawhood was sent with a reinforced brigade to destroy any rebel forces he could catch. He set out with a battalion each of light infantry and grenadiers, plus the 3rd Brigade. The latter formation consisted of the 10th Foot, 37th Foot, 38th Foot and 52nd Foot, recently transferred from the Rhode Island garrison. Near Spanktown, now Rahway, New Jersey, Mawhood found a group of militia herding some livestock covered by a larger body of Americans waiting on a nearby hill. The British officer sent the grenadier company of the 42nd Foot on a wide flanking maneuver. Just as the grenadiers prepared to launch their assault, they were fired on from ambush and routed with the loss of 26 men. At this moment, Maxwell sent his superior force forward to envelop Mawhood's force. The American force included the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th New Jersey Regiments, the 1st and 8th Pennsylvania Regiments, and the German Battalion. Mawhood's surprised men were hounded all the way back to Amboy, which they reached at 8:00 PM. The Americans lost 5 killed and 9 wounded, and claimed to have inflicted 100 casualties. Mawhood admitted losing 69 killed and wounded and 6 missing.

Historian David Hackett Fischer compiled a list that he describes as "incomplete", consisting of 58 actions that occurred between January 4 and March 21, 1777. The documented British and German casualties numbered more than 900; a number of the events do not include any casualty reports. Combined with their losses at Trenton and Princeton, the British lost more men in New Jersey than they did during the campaign for New York City. Fischer does not estimate American casualties, and other historians (e.g. Ketchum and Mitnick) have not compiled any casualty estimates. Fischer notes that relatively few official reports of American (either militia or Continental Army) unit strengths for this time period have survived.

The 1777 military campaigns began to take shape in April. General Charles Cornwallis punctuated the winter skirmishes with an attack on the Continental Army outpost at Bound Brook on April 13. In the Battle of Bound Brook, he very nearly captured its commander, Benjamin Lincoln. Outnumbering the Americans 2,000 to 500, the British scattered the militia but met stubborn resistance from the 8th Pennsylvania Regiment. The British captured three 3-pound guns and 20 or 30 men and killed six Americans, but the bulk of Lincoln's force got away. General Washington moved his army from its winter quarters at Morristown to a more forward position at Middlebrook in late May to better react to British moves. As General Howe prepared his Philadelphia campaign, he first moved a large portion of his army to Somerset Court House in mid-June, apparently in an attempt to draw Washington from the Middlebrook position. When this failed, Howe withdrew his army back to Perth Amboy, and embarked it on ships bound for the Chesapeake Bay. Northern and coastal New Jersey continued to be the site of skirmishing and raiding by the British forces that occupied New York City for the rest of the war.

Greg Whittington

Greg Whittington (born February 7, 1993) is an American professional basketball player who last played for Galatasaray Doğa Sigorta of the Basketbol Süper Ligi. After a tumultuous college career with Georgetown, Whittington began his professional career by helping the Sioux Falls Skyforce win the 2016 NBA D-League championship. He went on to play in Australia, Japan, Israel and Turkey.

Whittington attended Oakland Mills High School in Columbia, Maryland where he was a four-year letterwinner playing for the basketball team. As a senior in 2010–11, he averaged 23.5 points, 11.6 rebounds, 4.4 blocks, 3.0 steals and 2.7 assists per game, while earning All-Met Player of the Year and Howard County Player of the Year honors for leading his team to an undefeated season, finishing 25–0.

<START>As a freshman at [Q5547005:Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown] in [OPTIONAL:Q4623948|[DATETIME|2011]–[DATETIME|12]], [Q21066526:Greg Whittington|Whittington] appeared in all [QUANTITY|33] games while averaging [QUANTITY|4.3] points and [QUANTITY|2.9] rebounds in [QUANTITY|20.1] minutes per game.

[Q21066526:Greg Whittington|Whittington] sat out the entire [OPTIONAL:Q16192093|2014–15 season] while still recovering from [COREF:Q21066526:Greg Whittington|his] [Q18912826:anterior cruciate ligament injury|ACL injury]. [COREF:Q21066526:Greg Whittington|He] spent time working out with the [Q15927936:Westchester Knicks|Westchester Knicks] of the [Q842793:NBA G League|NBA Development League].<END>

In May and June 2015, Whittington took part in pre-draft workouts with the Indiana Pacers and the Boston Celtics. He ultimately went undrafted in the 2015 NBA draft and joined the Miami Heat for the 2015 NBA Summer League, playing in both Orlando and Las Vegas. In nine games, he averaged 9.1 points, 6.2 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 1.4 steals and 1.3 blocks per game. He later joined the Heat for training camp and appeared in four preseason games.

On November 2, 2015, Whittington was acquired by the Sioux Falls Skyforce of the NBA Development League as an affiliate player of the Heat. He appeared in all 10 games for the Skyforce to begin the season, helping them to a 7–3 record while averaging 15.2 points, 9.3 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 2.4 steals per game. However, a hand injury suffered in mid-December saw him miss two months of action. The Skyforce finished the regular season with a league-best 40–10 record, going on to reach the D-League Finals, where they defeated the Los Angeles D-Fenders 2–1 to claim their first D-League championship. In game two, Whittington scored a team-high 17 points. In 34 games (27 regular season, 7 playoff) for the Skyforce in 2015–16, he averaged 13.5 points, 7.6 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 1.9 steals and 1.0 blocks per game. At the season's end, he earned NBA D-League All-Rookie Team honors.

In the 2016 off-season, Whittington decided against participating in Summer League activities and instead went home to Maryland to work out with his local counterparts. Such players included NBA stars Victor Oladipo and Jerami Grant.

On August 13, 2016, Whittington signed with the Sydney Kings for the 2016–17 NBL season. He made his debut for the Kings in their season opener on October 8, 2016, but struggled to make an impact offensively in 24 minutes due to foul trouble. He finished with six points, four rebounds, two assists, two steals and three blocks in a 77–73 loss to the Brisbane Bullets. In the Kings' fourth game of the season on October 20, Whittington scored a season-high 22 points in a 92–78 win over the New Zealand Breakers. On November 5, he had a season-high 16 rebounds in a 64–57 loss to the Cairns Taipans.

Bakers Narrows

Bakers Narrows, Manitoba, is a small residential community approximately 20 km southeast of Flin Flon on Lake Athapapuskow. There are five subdivisions located near the lakeshore with a total of approximately 150 cottages, many of which are permanent residences.

The community consists of both winterized homes and seasonal cottages. It straddles the North Arm and Little Athapap sections of Lake Athapapuskow and lies within Bakers Narrows Provincial Park. It is the location of the Flin Flon Airport and the Flin Flon/Bakers Narrows Water Aerodrome.

The remote community is surrounded by Precambrian boreal forest, a mixed forest of coniferous and deciduous trees of the Canadian Shield. There are stands of black spruce, jack pine, white spruce, and trembling aspen. The area is home to moose, black bear, lynx, wolf, and beaver. Bird species include raven, common loon, spruce grouse, bald eagle and hawk owl. There is some trapping and hunting, and recreational fishing is popular.

 The narrows have been inhabited since prehistoric times. Archaeological digs at Bakers Narrows Provincial Park revealed pottery, arrowheads, and other artifacts indicating regular habitation by the "Shield Archaic Culture", who hunted caribou in the area as far back as 7000 years ago. They were eventually supplanted by the Woodland Cree who were nomadic hunters in this region. The narrows were a seasonal camp for Cree families who would gather during the summer before heading to their individual hunting grounds in the autumn.

The first European to visit Bakers Narrows was Joseph Hansom. In the summer of 1773, as a young fur trader, he was sent inland by the Governor of Churchill to extend the reach of the Hudson's Bay Company. Hansom paddled from Lake Kississing down the Pineroot River, reaching Lake Athapapuskow and Bakers Narrows. Donaldson B. Dowling, working for the Geological Survey of Canada, was the first to survey the narrows in 1899.

<START>The name comes from the [QUANTITY|first] homesteader, [Unknown1:|Bill Baker] a [Q14009165|trapper] and [Q42625830|prospector] from [Q1904:Ontario|Ontario], who settled there with [COREF:Unknown1:|his] wife [Unknown2:|Lydia Paul] (from the [Q60760278:|Cumberland House Cree Nation]) in approximately [DATETIME|1910] with the intention of establishing a trading post.

Let's Go (will.i.am song)

"Let's Go" is a song by will.i.am that features Chris Brown, which was part of the former's fourth studio album "#willpower" before being removed in November 2013. The reason for the song's removal was due to the unlicensed sampling of "Rebound" by Arty and Mat Zo. It was replaced with "Feelin' Myself" on the re-release.

The Archives nationales d'outre-mer in Aix-en-Provence is a branch of the Archives Nationales of France that documents the French colonial empire. According to one scholar, "half the history of France overseas was represented in the mass of papers" first assembled in Aix in 1966. The materials originated in various offices and repositories scattered throughout the colonies. The Dépôt des Archives d'Outre-Mer opened in 1966, and its successor, the Centre des Archives d'Outre-Mer, in 1987. It was later renamed the "Archives nationales d'outre-mer." Its facilities occupy a site near the Université de Provence Aix-Marseille I.

The archives groups its holdings by ministry, territory, document format (images, maps); it also has non-government materials. In 1986 the main national archives in Paris transferred to Aix its records of the "Section outre-mer." In 1995 the archives received substantial additional materials generated by colonial offices.

Before [Q362:World War II|World War II], all engine-design work was transferred to mass-production motor-building plants and their own design bureaus. [Q190610:|CIAM] focused on theoretical and experimental research and modernization of prototypes up to the production stage.

After [COREF:Q362:World War II|the war], [Q190610:|CIAM] was engaged with reactive (jet) engines for airplanes, successors to the [QUANTITY|first]-generation turbojets. In the early [DATETIME|1950s], the largest test base in [Q46:Europe|Europe] was built in [Q157779:Lytkarino|Lytkarino]. In the [DATETIME|1970s], [COREF:Q190610:|the institute] began work on a ramjet engine using the special hypersonic "flying laboratory" [Unknown3|GLL [Q3196199:|Holod]]. This experiment used a [Q622779|liquid hydrogen], actively cooled dual-mode ramjet, which was based on a [Q556|hydrogen]-fueled axisymmetrical engine placed on a [Q159:Russia|Russian] [Q326673:S-200|SA5] missile during the flight. The [QUANTITY|first] successful test achieved Mach [QUANTITY|5.6] in [DATETIME|1991], and the maximum speed achieved was Mach [QUANTITY|5.7] in [DATETIME|November 1992]. A test with a goal of Mach [QUANTITY|6.3] failed in [DATETIME|March 1995].<END>

After the dissolution of the USSR, CIAM lost a large number of emigrating engineers. With the loss of government support and a lack of state aviation strategy, CIAM stayed afloat with contracts with China, French corporations, ABB and by offering logistical services. As of 2011, the situation has stabilized; CIAM leads some Russian programs, including development of the new perspective scramjet GLL Igla. It also researches gas pipelines; in March 2006, the institute signed an agreement with JSC Gasprom.

"Athertonia diversifolia" is found in north Queensland from Cape Tribulation south to Mt Bartle Frere. Its habitat is rainforest, generally from 700 to 1150 m in altitude. but is found at 400 m at Alexandra Creek. Much of its former habitat has been cleared. The soils are deep volcanic loams.

Atherton almond is cultivated to a limited extent for its edible nut, but makes a good specimen tree in large parks and has potential as an indoor foliage plant, or as a foliage plant in the cut flower industry. The species is readily propagated by seed.

"Athertonia diversifolia" is the floral emblem of the Atherton shire in north Queensland. It is known as the Atherton oak due to the shape of its immature leaves which resemble those of the English oak "Quercus robur", to which it is unrelated.

Jonesport, Maine

Jonesport is a town in Washington County, Maine, United States. The population was 1,370 at the 2010 census. Jonesport is a fishing and lobstering town.

Settled before the American Revolution, Jonesport was part of a grant of 48160 acre made by the Massachusetts General Court in 1789 to John C. Jones and others. It was incorporated on March 4, 1809, as Jonesborough. On February 3, 1832, a portion of Jonesborough was set off and incorporated as Jones' Port. Then a portion of Jonesport was set off and incorporated on April 7, 1925, as the island town of Beals, accessible by bridge, built in 1958, across the Moosabec Reach.

Located on a peninsula 6 mi out in the Gulf of Maine, the town's principal industries are fishing, boat building, harvesting blueberries, and tourist services. Jonesport includes many uninhabited islands which provide nesting areas for eider, cormorants, seagulls, razorbills, guillemots, loons, black scoters, grebes and eagles. There are two nature preserves: Western Brothers Island and the Great Wass Archipelago (which includes Great Wass Island), the latter shared with the town of Beals.

In 1866, a group of Christian restorationists sailed from Jonesport to Ottoman-occupied Palestine in the hope of preparing the land for the Jews to return, thereby hastening the coming of the Christian Messiah. The Maine Friendship House, a small, wooden clapboard New England-style house built by one of those families, still stands in modern Tel Aviv.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 100.35 sqmi, of which, 28.51 sqmi of it is land and 71.84 sqmi is water. Jonesport is situated on a peninsula between Chandler Bay, Wohoa Bay and the tidal Indian River, all part of the Gulf of Maine and Atlantic Ocean. Roque Island, Chandler Island, Great Spruce Island, and several others are located offshore, separating Chandler Bay from Englishman Bay.

The town is crossed by Maine State Route 187. It is bordered by the towns of Addison to the west, Jonesboro to the north, and Beals to the south.

Partula (gastropod)

Partula is a genus of air-breathing tropical land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusks in the family Partulidae. Many species of "Partula" are known under the general common names "Polynesian tree snail" and "Moorean viviparous tree snail". Partulids are distributed across 5000 sqmi of Pacific Ocean islands, from the Society Islands to New Guinea.

Once used as decorative items in Polynesian ceremonial wear and jewelry, these small snails (averaging about one-half to three-quarters of an inch in length) gained the attention of science when Dr. Henry Crampton (along with Yoshio Kondo) spent 50 years studying and cataloging partulids, detailing their remarkable array of morphological elements, ecological niches, and behavioral aspects that illustrate adaptive radiation.

The partulids of the island of Tahiti act as an example of the possible deleterious effects of attempted biological control. After an infestation of the introduced giant African land snails ("Achatina" spp.), the carnivorous Florida rosy wolfsnail ("Euglandina rosea") was introduced into Tahiti in an attempt to combat the African species.

The wolfsnail chose instead to hunt and eat members of the nearly 76 species of "Partula" that were endemic to Tahiti and the nearby islands, devouring all but 12 species in a decade. Several scientists recognized what was going on, and were able to save 12 species prior to their becoming extinct.

Today, the Zoological Society of London runs the Partula Programme Consortium which maintains a captive-breeding programme in the United Kingdom, France, and the United States.

2002–03 Columbus Blue Jackets season

The 2002–03 Columbus Blue Jackets season was the Blue Jackets' third season in the National Hockey League (NHL), as the team was coming off of a 22–47–8–5 record in the 2001–02 season, earning 57 points and finishing in last in the Western Conference.

The Blue Jackets got off to a good start, having a 7–5–1–1 record in their opening 14 games. Columbus, however, won only two of their next 12 games to fall out of the playoff picture. The club would play mediocre hockey for the rest of the season, finishing with a 29–42–8–3 record, earning 69 points for last place in the Western Conference for the second-straight season. Midway through the season, Columbus fired Head Coach Dave King after a 14–20–4–2 start. King was replaced with General Manager Doug MacLean, as the Blue Jackets posted a record of 15–22–4–1 record under his guidance. The 69 points was a 12-point improvement over the previous season, but the club finished 23 points behind the Edmonton Oilers for the final playoff spot in the Conference. The previous season, the Blue Jackets scored a League-low 164 goals, however, the team would beat that total by 49 goals, finishing with a club record 213 goals. Columbus though led the NHL in goals against, allowing 263, also a club record.

Ray Whitney led the club in points for the second-straight season, earning a club record 76 points, as he scored 24 goals and 52 assists. Geoff Sanderson rebounded from an injury-plagued 2001–02 season to score a club record 34 goals, while Andrew Cassels earned 68 points in his first season in Columbus. David Vyborny had a breakout season, scoring 20 goals and 46 points. On the blueline, Jaroslav Spacek scored nine goals and earned 45 points in his first full season with the team. Jody Shelley led the team with 249 penalty minutes, setting a franchise record.

Lochia

In the field of obstetrics, lochia is the vaginal discharge after giving birth, containing blood, mucus, and uterine tissue. Lochia discharge typically continues for four to six weeks after childbirth, a time known as the postpartum period or puerperium. A 2016 review ties this "lochial period" to worldwide customs of postpartum confinement, a time for the new mother and baby to bond.

Lochia is sterile for the first two days, but not so by the third or fourth day, as the uterus begins to be colonized by vaginal commensals such as non-hemolytic streptococci and "E. coli".

<START>It progresses through [QUANTITY|three] stages:


In general, lochia has an odor similar to that of normal menstrual fluid. Any offensive odor or change to a [Q3133|greenish] color indicates contamination by organisms such as [Q846309|chlamydia] or [Q1708986|saprophytic].

Kingdoms of Sunda

Kingdoms of Sunda refers to the monarchies of the Sundanese region prior to the establishment of Indonesia in 1945 AD.
The history includes several eras:

According to the manuscript “Pustaka Rayja-rayja I Bhumi Nusantara”, the first kingdom in Javadwipa (Java island) is Salakanagara (lit: country of silver). Salakanagara was established in Year 52 Saka (130/131 AD). The location of the kingdom is believed to be in Teluk Lada, Pandeglang city, the city which is famous for metal works. (Pandeglang, or pande gelang is Sundanese words for the maker of metal bracelets or armlets). Dr. Edi S. Ekajati, Sundanese historian, conjectured that the location of the capital city of the kingdom was in current Merak City (lit: silvery city). Some people also conjectured that the kingdom was situated around Mount Salak, based on the pronunciation of the words Salaka and Salak which are almost the same.

It is very probable that Argyre or Argyros at the west end of Iabadiou mentioned by Claudius Ptolemaeus Pelusiniensis (Ptolemy) of Alexandria (87-150 AD), in his work “Geographike Hypergesis” is Salakanagara.

<START>A [Q10870555|report] from [Q148|China] in [DATETIME|132] said that [Unknown1|Pien], the [Q116|king] of [Unknown2|Ye-tiau], lent [Q897|gold] stamp and [Q428124|violet] ribbon to [Unknown3|Tiao-Pien]. The word [OPTIONAL:Unknown2|Ye-tiau] is interpreted by [Q18057594|G. Ferrand], a [Q142|[Q121842|French]] [Q201788|historian], as [Unknown4|Javadwipa] and [Unknown3|Tiao-pien] referred to [Unknown5|Dewawarman].

The [Q2673941|Salakanagara Kingdom] was then replaced by the [Q2247225|Tarumanagara Kingdom].

The heyday of the [Q2247225|Tarumanagara Kingdom] was between the [DATETIME|fourth] and [DATETIME|seventh centuries]. The historical record of [COREF:Q2247225|the kingdom] is a sketchy account by a [Q148|[Q57026211|Chinese]] [Q22813352|traveler] and several rock inscriptions discovered in the western part of [Q3757|[Q3757|Java] island]. These sources agree that the most powerful [Q116|king] of [Q2247225|Tarumanegara] was [Q12507243|Purnavarman], who conquered neighbouring countries.<END>

The United Kingdom of Sunda and Galuh was a kingdom in West Java and western part of Central Java territory which emerged as a unification of the Sunda kingdom and the Galuh kingdom. The two kingdoms themselves were a result of the division of the former Tarumanagara kingdom. This kingdom was often just called the Sunda Kingdom based on historical primary resources such as stone inscriptions and old literature.

The area covered by the Sunda kingdom until early in the 16th century

Based on the travel records of Prince Bujangga Manik, a Hindu Sundanese monk who visited all of the holy Hindu sites in Java and Bali islands at the beginning of the sixteenth century AD, in his lontar manuscripts, which are saved in the Bodleian Library of Oxford University of England since the 16th century, the border of the Sunda kingdom in the west is the Sunda Strait and in the east is the Cipamali River (present day Brebes River) and Serayu River in Central Java Province.

Historical record

The earliest time of a reference to the name Sunda being used to identify a kingdom, is written on the Prasasti Kebon Kopi II stone inscription of 458 Saka (536 AD) and copperplate letters of the fifteenth century with royal instructions telling the existence of the Sunda kingdom. Another reference to the kingdom is the Sanghiyang Tapak inscriptions. There are also certain Chinese sources concerning the Sunda kingdom; the first source is a report from Chu-fan-chi from 1225 AD and the second source is the Chinese book ""shun-feng hsiang-sung"" from about 1430 AD. European explorers also report the existence of the Sunda kingdom. One of the explorers was Tomé Pires from Portugal. Tomé Pires, in his report “Summa Oriental (1513–1515)”, wrote about his journey to the Sunda kingdom. Diogo do Couto also wrote that the Sunda kingdom is thriving and abundant; it lies between Java and Sumatra, having between it and the latter the Straits of Sunda. Besides that, the Portuguese made a peace treaty with the Sunda kingdom in 1522 AD. This treaty is better known as the Luso Sundanese Treaty of Sunda Kalapa. Henrique Leme erected a padrão to memorialize the treaty.

In the early sixteenth century AD, the kingdom was divided into three smaller kingdoms, including the Sultanate of Banten and the Sultanate of Cirebon. But many historical resources tell the existence of the third kingdom in south east of West Java, i.e. the Sumedanglarang Kingdom.

In 1524/1525, Sunan Gunung Jati from Cirebon together with Demak Sultanate armies seized the port of Banten from the control of the Sunda kingdom, and established The Sultanate of Banten affiliating with the Demak Sultanate. Islam preachers have penetrated and introduced people to the peaceful way of life of Islam, and as a result many people in the region embraced Islam as their belief.

During 1552-1570, Maulana Hasanudin ruled as the first Sultan of Banten.

Reaching its golden age during the first half of the seventeenth century, the Sultanate of Banten lasted for 300 years (1526–1813 AD). The grandeur of this Sultanate has left us with a plethora of archeological remains and historical records. It is for this reason that there will never be a lack of sources in retracing the history of the Sultanate of Banten.

The Sultanate of Cirebon (Indonesian: Kesultanan Cirebon, Sundanese: Kasultanan Cirebon) was a sultanate in Sunda land, founded in the sixteenth century. It is said to have been founded by Sunan Gunungjati, who also established The Sultanate of Banten.

**** ARTICLE #62: Toytown (horse) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11105810) *****
Toytown (horse)

Toytown was a British event horse owned and ridden by Zara Phillips.

Toytown was a chestnut gelding born in 1992, standing at 17hh and with particularly distinctive markings including a white blaze and white spots. Toytown and Phillips competed together at the highest level of the sport until the horse's retirement in 2011, after accruing 1,421 British Eventing points in his career.

Toytown's exact breeding is unknown. Noddy was spotted as a 7-year-old novice eventer in 1999 by Zara's father, Mark Phillips, when rider and former owner Meryl Winter went to him for a lesson. Zara bought the horse a few months later after watching him jump with her stepmother and dressage coach Sandy Pflueger. Zara has since commented that he "looked a bit like a hat-rack when we first saw him but I got on really well with him."
Despite Winter's description of him as a 'cross country machine', Toytown was far from a natural eventer, with a particular lack of respect for show jumps - at the Windsor CCI** in 2001, Zara and Toytown entered the ring in the lead only to finish out of the running with six fences down and 25 penalty points.

However, Zara and Toytown's hard work with Mark Phillips in the show jumping ring and Pflueger in the Dressage arena put paid to these teething problems, and the pair's first real success came with the Young Rider title at Bramham Horse Trials in 2002, followed by individual silver at the 2002 Young Riders European Championships in Austria.

This success was cemented in their CCI**** debut at Burghley Horse Trials in 2003. Competing at this level for the first time, over a particularly challenging course, Zara and Toytown found themselves in the lead after the cross country and missed overall victory by just one fence, losing to then-world number one Pippa Funnell on her way to the Rolex Grand Slam.

Far from being an easy horse to ride, Zara comments that he "doesn’t like performing these days unless it really matters" (something he demonstrated at the 2007 Festival of British Eventing when, according to the BBC's equestrian correspondent Clare Balding, he "went complete bonkers and started rearing" during the Dressage), and that "Toytown, almost always, has to do something to show he is in control."

A leg injury following Burghley forced Toytown out of contention for the 2004 Athens Olympics and the entire 2004 season, and an injury during final preparations for the 2008 Beijing Olympics forced the pair to concede their place in the British team.

Zara Phillips officially retired Toytown from competition on the final day of the 2011 Festival of British Eventing at Gatcombe Park. The popular gelding was paraded to fans and spectators in the main arena before leaving for the rolling Gloucestershire countryside of the Gatcombe Estate. Toytown made a post retirement public appearance with Phillips at Cheltenham racecourse in 2012 as part of the 2012 Summer Olympics torch relay.

Bucay, Abra

', officially the ' (; ), is a 3rd class  in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.

Bucay was established on October 29, 1846 and the first settlers were Itnegs. It became the first provincial capital of Abra when the military form of government was set up in May 1847. At the back of the present municipal hall is the centuries-old façade of the ruined "Casa Real" (Provincial Capitol Building). Across the town plaza, stand the centuries-old Catholic church, convent and learning school, Spanish structure house owned by then Don Teodoro Arias who served as Gobernadorcillo of Bucay in 1862, and the old American structure house which was built in 1908 and owned by then US Corporal Ernest D. Smith who served the Spanish–American War and the Filipino-American war from 1896 to 1901. Prior to the invasion of the Spaniards, the place had become footfalls of invading headhunters from the dense jungles of the Cordillera range.

There are two versions on how this town got its name as "Bucay". Some residents say that there was a tribe leader by the name of Bucay. When this leader was still young, while patrolling, he found a pretty young lass lying on the way which prompted him to extend assistance, and brought her home. After a period of time, he developed his love with the young lass and took her as his wife. In several occasions, the girl suddenly disappeared.

Hacking knife

<START>Hacking or side knives may be considered as either light hatchets or heavyweight knives.

They are strongly constructed with a single-sided straight edge, resembling a small cleaver. The back of the blade is exposed for hammering on. Unusually for an axe, this back edge is intended to be hit with a steel hammer, not a wooden mallet or club. The handle is a solid steel through tang, with side scales. The scales are often of thick leather, to absorb shocks.

Their typical uses are either for [Q664283|glazier]'s work, or else as a light froe for splitting timber.<END>

The hacking knife is used to chop out old putty before replacing glass panes. The cut is always made into the side of the frame, parallel to the surface of the glass, so as to avoid striking the glass and probably cracking it. Old putty is brittle and easily breaks out into small pieces. The hacking knife is strong enough to cut through any hidden glazing sprigs (small nails) that are hidden beneath the putty.

The side knife may be used as a light froe, for splitting small billets of wood. It is driven through the billet using a hammer. Unlike a froe's extended handle, the side knife does not permit twisting to lever the split open and so it must be driven through all the way.

The Eastern & Oriental Express is a luxury train that carries passengers between Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand.

It runs between Singapore's Woodlands Train Checkpoint and Hua Lamphong, Bangkok, stopping at Kuala Lumpur, Butterworth, and Kanchanaburi, taking three days (two nights). Since 2007 the train has also travelled between Bangkok and Vientiane, the capital city of Laos.

The train is operated by Belmond Ltd. It runs several times a month most of the year.

Fares on the Bangkok to Singapore train in September 2015 (four days, three nights) start at US$2,690.

The train was built in Japan in 1972 and operated as the Silver Star in New Zealand. All 31 carriages were later operated by Orient-Express Hotels, which in 2014 changed its name to Belmond Ltd. Twenty-four carriages were regauged from New Zealand's gauge to gauge for Thai and Malaysian railway lines by A & G Price of Thames, New Zealand. An extensive internal rebuild and fit-out plus exterior painting and badging was undertaken by the new owners at their (then) newly constructed maintenance depot on KTMB land in Singapore's Keppel Road rail yards. The design of the remodelling was by Gérard Gallet, the man behind much of the design and refurbishment of other Belmond products such as the British Pullman and the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express.

George Virtue

George C. Virtue (1794 – 8 December 1868) was a 19th-century London publisher, well known for printing engravings. His publishing house was located at 26 Ivy Lane, Paternoster Row, London, EC.

Virtue selected accomplished artists, employed the best engravers, and produced books that were rarely surpassed in elegance and correctness for the period. Chief among his publications were the following, all illustrated by William Henry Bartlett: "Switzerland", by William Beattie, 2 vols. 1836; "Scotland", by W. Beattie, 1838; "The Waldenses", by W. Beattie, 1838; "American Scenery", 2 vols. 1840; "Description of the Beauties of the Bosphorus", by Julia Pardoe, 1840; and "The Danube, its History and Scenery", by W. Beattie, 1844. Virtue created a prodigious business, issuing upwards of twenty thousand copper and steel engravings through his career.

In 1848, Virtue purchased two magazines. One was an art publication, "The Art Union", which had been founded in 1839 by Hodgson & Graves, then purchased in 1847 by Chapman & Hall. The second purchase was controlling interest in "Sharpe's London Magazine", a literary and cultural magazine, Arthur Hall publisher. In 1849, Virtue renamed the art magazine "The Art Journal" and, in time, it became known as the premier art publication of Great Britain. Also in 1849, he created a new firm with Arthur Hall called "Arthur Hall, Virtue & Co.".


Virtue's wife was named Helen.

<START>Their oldest son, [Unknown1|George Henry Virtue] (d.[DATETIME|1866]) was [Q388338|Treasurer] of the [Q3942072|Royal Numismatic Society] for several years.

When [Q5545506|Virtue] retired from [COREF:Q5545506|his] publishing business in [DATETIME|1855], [COREF:Q5545506|his] [QUANTITY|second] son, [Q6143462|James Sprent Virtue], took over the business, having spent many years in [Q30|the [Q30|United States]] overseeing the [Unknown2|Virtue]'s [Q60|New York] publishing house.

In [DATETIME|1861], the youngest son, [Unknown3|William Alexander Virtue] (d.[DATETIME|1875]), was promoted to [Q22683250|Lieutenant], [Unknown4|vice Turney], with the [Unknown5|39th Middlesex Rifle Volunteer Corps].. In 
[DATETIME|1865], [COREF:Unknown3|he] became a partner in the [Unknown2|Virtue]'s [Q5123401|City Road] and [Unknown6|Ivy Lane] publishing houses before moving to [Q30|the [Q30|United States]] and taking over the [Unknown2|Virtue]'s [Q60|New York] publishing house, including "[Q96279339|Virtue and Yorston]" with [Unknown7|Charles H. Yorston].<END>

Virtue's daughter, Frances Virtue (d.1878), married the English essayist and historian, James Augustus Cotter Morison in 1861. They had one son, Theodore Morison, principal of Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College from 1899–1905 which later on became Aligarh Muslim University and member of the Council of India from 1906; and daughters Helen Cotter, and Margaret.

Virtue was a common councilman for the ward of Farringdon Within, and later was the deputy of his ward. He was a member of the court of the Stationers' Company and a director of the Great Central Gas Company.

Virtue retired in Oatlands Park. He died in 1868 at the home of his daughter, Frances Morison, on Porchester Square, London.

[QUANTITY|Two] other members of the cell die in the bombing and the [QUANTITY|fourth] is killed by police in a shoot-out during the raid to apprehend [COREF:Unknown1|him]. When [DESC:Unknown5|[Unknown1|Erdogan]'s [Q512345|Defense Barrister]] commits suicide, [Unknown2|Martin Rose] is appointed by the [Q2631987|Attorney General] to replace [COREF:Unknown5|him], joining [Q7574456|Special Advocate] [Unknown3|Claudia Simmons-Howe]. Due to national security concerns, [Unknown1|Erdogan]'s case follows closed material procedures; [Unknown3|Claudia] represents [Unknown1|Erdogan] during closed sessions with a [Q16533|judge] ruling what evidence is permissible for [Unknown2|Martin] to use in the open public trial. [Q210175|MI5] [Q392651|Agent] [Unknown4|Nazrul Sharma] is assigned to provide [Unknown3|Claudia] with the closed material and monitor [COREF:Unknown3|her] activities.

[Unknown2|Martin] discovers that despite [COREF:Unknown1|his] extensive criminal record, [Unknown1|Erdogan] was somehow quickly approved for immigration from [COREF:Unknown1|his] previous residence in [Q183|Germany] to [Q21|England] and within [QUANTITY|six] months was living well beyond [COREF:Unknown1|his] income. [COREF:Unknown2|He] finds proof that [Unknown1|Farroukh Erdogan] is really [Unknown1|Mussi Kartal], a member of a terror cell responsible for bombing a [Q11223|U.S. Air Force] base in [Q1726|Munich] a few years prior. [Unknown1|Kartal] cut a deal with [Q600751|prosecutors] to avoid prison, agreeing to work as an [Q1364673|informant] for [Q210175|MI5] by infiltrating the [Q84|London] terror cell and providing [Q210175|MI5] with information to make arrests. [Unknown2|Martin] suspects that after the [Q894072|Borough Market] bombing, [Q210175|MI5] feared [COREF:Q210175|their] botched operation would be publicly blamed as directly financing terrorism and sought to have [Unknown1|Kartal] take the fall and suppress any evidence of [Q210175|MI5] involvement. [Unknown2|Martin] and [Unknown3|Claudia] discussed the matters discreetly during the [Q47762|England national football team] match at the [Q128468|Wembley Stadium].<END>

In the first closed court session, MI5 Agent Melissa Fairbright reveals that Kartal's son Amir had hacked into his father's laptop and had provided valuable information to MI5. The judge orders Amir's testimony in court, deeming it relevant to the case. Amir, who is being monitored by MI5 agents at a safe house with his mother, manages to escape to his aunt's home. He meets with Martin and Claudia, giving them a flash drive detailing his father's involvement with the MI5 terror cell operation. Martin and Claudia realize MI5 will kill Amir to protect themselves and go on the run with him overnight, planning to have him testify in court the next day. Amir testifies in closed session, but Kartal is later murdered in prison and made to look like a suicide by hanging. With Kartal dead, the case collapses and all evidence of the MI5 operation is suppressed from public disclosure. Amir and his mother, however, are allowed to remain in England.

Three months later, as Martin and Claudia rekindle their romance that resulted in Martin's divorce from his wife, information of MI5's involvement in the Borough Market bombing is anonymously leaked to the media.

"Closed Circuit" has received mixed reviews from critics. It currently holds a 43% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 134 reviews, with the critical consensus saying "Slick and well acted, "Closed Circuit" unfortunately never quite works up a full head of steam, with a plot that's alternately predictable and full of holes." On another film aggregator, Metacritic, the film has a score of 50 (out of 100), based on 39 critics.

**** ARTICLE #86: Online identity (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2000128) *****
Online identity

Internet identity (IID), also online identity or internet persona, is a social identity that an Internet user establishes in online communities and websites. It can also be considered as an actively constructed presentation of oneself. Although some people choose to use their real names online, some Internet users prefer to be anonymous, identifying themselves by means of pseudonyms, which reveal varying amounts of personally identifiable information. An online identity may even be determined by a user's relationship to a certain social group they are a part of online. Some can even be deceptive about their identity.

In some online contexts, including Internet forums, online chats, and massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), users can represent themselves visually by choosing an avatar, an icon-sized graphic image. Avatars are one way users express their online identity. Through interaction with other users, an established online identity acquires a reputation, which enables other users to decide whether the identity is worthy of trust. Online identities are associated with users through authentication, which typically requires registration and logging in. Some websites also use the user's IP address or tracking cookies to identify users.

The concept of the self, and how this is influenced by emerging technologies, are a subject of research in fields such as education, psychology and sociology. The online disinhibition effect is a notable example, referring to a concept of unwise and uninhibited behavior on the Internet, arising as a result of anonymity and audience gratification.

The social web, i.e. the usage of the web to support the social process, represents a space in which people have the possibility to express and expose their identity in a social context.
For example, people define their identity explicitly by creating user profiles in social network services such as Facebook or LinkedIn and online dating services. By expressing opinions on blogs and other social media, they define more tacit identities.

The disclosure of a person's identity may present certain issues related to privacy. Many people adopt strategies that help them control the disclosure of their personal information online. Some strategies require users to invest considerable effort.

The emergence of the concept of online identity has raised many questions among academics. Social networking services and online avatars have complicated the concept of identity. Academia has responded to these emerging trends by establishing domains of scholarly research such as technoself studies, which focuses on all aspects of human identity in technological societies.

Online activities may affect our offline personal identity, as well. Avi Marciano has coined the term "VirtuReal" to resolve the contested relationship between online and offline environments in relation to identity formation. Studying online usage patterns of transgender people, he suggested that the internet can be used as preliminary, complementary, and/or alternative sphere. He concludes that although "the offline world sets boundaries that potentially limit the latitude within the online world, these boundaries are wide enough to allow mediated agency that empowers transgender users. Consequently, the term VirtuReal "reflects both the fact that it provides an empowering virtual experience that compensates for offline social inferiority, and the fact that it is nevertheless subject to offline restrictions".

Dorian Wiszniewski and Richard Coyne in their contribution to the book "Building Virtual Communities" explore online identity, with emphasis on the concept of "masking" identity. They point out that whenever an individual interacts in a social sphere they portray a mask of their identity. This is no different online and in fact becomes even more pronounced due to the decisions an online contributor must make concerning his or her online profile. He or she must answer specific questions about age, gender, address, username and so forth. Furthermore, with the accrual of one's online activity, his or her mask is increasingly defined by his or her style of writing, vocabulary and topics.

The kind of mask one chooses reveals at least something of the subject behind the mask. One might call this the "metaphor" of the mask. The online mask does not reveal the actual identity of a person. It, however, does reveal an example of what lies behind the mask. For instance, if a person chooses to act like a rock star online, this metaphor reveals an interest in rock music. Even if a person chooses to hide behind a totally false identity, this says something about the fear and lack of self-esteem behind the false mask.

Because of many emotional and psychological dynamics, people can be reluctant to interact online. By evoking a mask of identity a person can create a safety net. One of the great fears of online identity is having one's identity stolen or abused. This fear keeps people from sharing who they are. Some are so fearful of identity theft or abuse that they will not even reveal information already known about them in public listings. By making the mask available, people can interact with some degree of confidence without fear.

Wiszniewski and Coyne state "Education can be seen as the change process by which identity is realized, how one finds one's place. Education implicates the transformation of identity. Education, among other things, is a process of building up a sense of identity, generalized as a process of edification." Students interacting in an online community must reveal something about themselves and have others respond to this contribution. In this manner, the mask is constantly being formulated in dialogue with others and thereby students will gain a richer and deeper sense of who they are. There will be a process of edification that will help students come to understand their strengths and weaknesses.

This mask perspective is likened to the concept of 'blended identity', whereby the offline-self informs the creation of a new online-self, which in turn informs the offline-self through further interaction with those the individual first met online.

As blogs allow an individual to express his or her views in individual essays or as part of a wider discussion, it creates a public forum for expressing ideas. Bloggers often choose to use pseudonyms, whether in platforms such as WordPress or in interest-centered sites like Blogster, to protect personal information and allow them more editorial freedom to express ideas that might be unpopular with their family, employers, etc. Use of a pseudonym (and a judicious approach to revealing personal information) can allow a person to protect their "real" identities, but still build a reputation online using the assumed name.

Digital identity management is becoming something that individuals need to consider when applying for jobs of while working for a company. Social media has been a tool for human resources for years. A KPMG report on social media in human resources say that 76 percent of American companies used LinkedIn for recruiting. The ease of search means that reputation management will become more vital especially in professional services such as lawyers, doctors and accountants.

Online social networks like Facebook and MySpace allow people to maintain an online identity with some overlap between online and real world context. These identities are often created to reflect a specific aspect or ideal version of themselves. Representations include pictures, communications with other 'friends' and membership in network groups. Privacy control settings on social networks are also part of social networking identity.

Some users may use their online identity as an extension of their physical selves, and center their profiles around realistic details. These users value continuity in their identity, and would prefer being honest with the portrayal of themselves. However, there is also a group of social network users that would argue against using a real identity online. These users have experimented with online identity, and ultimately what they have found is that it is possible to create an alternate identity through the usage of such social networks. For example, a popular blogger on medium.com writes under the name of Kel Campbell – a name that was chosen by her, not given to her. She states that when she was verbally attacked online by another user, she was able to protect herself from the sting of the insult by taking it as Kel, rather than her true self. Kel became a shield of sorts, and acted as a mask that freed the real user beneath it.

Such are the benefits of forming an alternate identity in online spaces. The "I" becomes subject to the "Me", and individuals are given the power to shape themselves into whoever (or whatever) they desire to become. Stories of people learning about their "hidden extroversion" or "unknown creativity" or becoming "someone else" are still at large. Research from scientists such as Danah Boyd and Knut Lundby has even found that in some cultures, the ability to form an identity online is considered a sacred privilege. This is because having an online identity allows the user to accomplish things that otherwise are impossible to do in real life. These cultures believe that the self has become a subjective concept on the online spaces; by logging onto their profiles, users are essentially freed from the prison of a physical body and can "create a narrative of the self in virtual space that may be entirely new".

The possibilities are endless – which is a feasible explanation for the explosive popularity of social networking sites in the past decade. Users are captivated by the opportunity to express themselves in an endless number of ways. Perhaps social networks will always remain popular, as long as the incentive to join is always present.

In the development of social networks, there has appeared a new economic phenomenon: doing business via social networks. For example, there are many users of WeChat called wei-businessmen (Wechat businessman, a new form of e-commerce in Wechat) who sell products on WeChat. Doing business via social networks is not that easy. The identities of users in social networks are not the same as that in the real world. For the sake of security, people do not tend to trust someone in social networks, in particular when it is related with money. So for wei-businessmen, reputations are very important for wei-business. They need to invest enormous efforts to gain reputations among the users of WeChat, which in turn increases the chance other users will purchase from them.

Online identity in classrooms forces people to reevaluate their concepts of classroom environments. With the invention of online classes, classrooms have changed and no longer have the traditional face-to-face communications. These communications have been replaced by computer screen. Students are no longer defined by visual characteristics unless they make them known. There are pros and cons to each side. In a traditional classroom, students are able to visually connect with a teacher who was standing in the same room. During the class, if questions arise, clarification can be provided immediately. Students can create face-to-face connections with other students, and these connections can easily be extended beyond the classroom. For timid or socially awkward students, this ability to form and extend relationships through personal contact may hold little appeal. For these students, the appeal may reside in online courses, where computer communications allow them a greater degree of separation and anonymity.

With the prevalence of remote Internet communications, students do not form preconceptions of their classmates based on the classmate's appearance or speech characteristics. Rather, impressions are formed based only on the information presented by the classmate. Some students are more comfortable with this paradigm as it avoids the discomfort of public speaking. Students who do not feel comfortable stating their ideas in class can take time to sit down and think through exactly what they wish to say.

Communication via written media may lead students to take more time to think through their ideas since their words are in a more permanent setting (online) than most conversations carried on during class (Smith).

Online learning situations also cause a shift in perception of the professor. Whereas anonymity may help some students achieve a greater level of comfort, professors must maintain an active identity with which students may interact. The students should feel that their professor is ready to help whenever they may need it. Although students and professors may not be able to meet in person, emails and correspondence between them should occur in a timely manner. Without this students tend to drop online classes since it seems that they are wandering through a course without anyone to guide them.

In Virtual world, the users create a personal avatar and communicate with others through the virtual identity. The virtual personal figure and voice may draw from the real figure or fantasy worlds. The virtual figure to some degree reflects the personal expectation, and users may play a totally different personality in virtual world than in reality.

An Internet forum, or message board, is an online discussion site where people can hold conversations in the form of posted messages.
There are many types of Internet forums based on certain themes or groups. The properties of online identities also differ from different type of forums. For example, the users in a university BBS usually know some of the others in reality since the users can only be the students or professors in this university. However the freedom of expression is limited since some university BBSs are under control of the school administration and the identities are related to student IDs. On another hand, some question-and-answer websites like "ZhiHu" in China are open to the public and users can create accounts only with e-mail address. But they can describe their specialties or personal experiences to show reliability in certain questions, and other users can also invite them to answer questions based on their profiles. The answers and profiles can be either real-name or anonymous.

A discussed positive aspect of virtual communities is that people can now present themselves without fear of persecution, whether it is personality traits, behaviors that they are curious about, or the announcement of a real world identity component that has never before been announced.

This freedom results in new opportunities for society as a whole, especially the ability for people to explore the roles of gender and sexuality in a manner that can be harmless, yet interesting and helpful to those undertaking the change. Online identity has given people the opportunity to feel comfortable in wide-ranging roles, some of which may be underlying aspects of the user's life that the user is unable to portray in the real world.

Online identity has a beneficial effect for minority groups, including ethnic minority populations, people with disabilities, etc. Online identities may help remove prejudices created by stereotypes found in real life, and thus provide a greater sense of inclusion.

A prime example of these opportunities is the establishment of many communities welcoming gay and lesbian teens who are dealing with their sexuality. These communities allow teens to share their experiences with one another and older gay and lesbian people, and may they provide a community that is both non-threatening and non-judgmental. In a review of such a community, Silberman quotes an information technology worker, Tom Reilly, as stating: "The wonderful thing about online services is that they are an intrinsically decentralized resource. Kids can challenge what adults have to say and make the news". If teen organizers are successful anywhere, news of it is readily available. The Internet is arguably the most powerful tool that young people with alternative sexualities have ever had.

The online world provides users with a choice to determine which sex, sexuality preference and sexual characteristics they would like to embody. In each online encounter, a user essentially has the opportunity to interchange which identity they would like to portray. As McRae argues in Surkan (2000), "The lack of physical presence and the infinite malleability of bodies complicates sexual interaction in a singular way: because the choice of gender is an "option" rather than a strictly defined biological characteristic, the entire concept of gender as a primary marker of identity becomes partially subverted."

Online identity can offer potential social benefits to those with physical and sensory disabilities. The flexibility of online media provides control over their disclosure of impairment, an opportunity not typically available in real world social interactions. Researchers highlight its value in improving inclusion. However, it is notable that the affordance of "normalization" offers the possibility of experiencing non-stigmatized identities while also offering the capacity to create harmful and dangerous outcomes, which may jeopardize participants' safety.

Primarily, concerns regarding virtual identity revolve around the areas of misrepresentation and the contrasting effects of on and offline existence. Sexuality and sexual behavior online provide some of the most controversial debate with many concerned about the predatory nature of some users. This is particularly in reference to concerns about child pornography and the ability of pedophiles to obscure their identity.

Finally, the concerns regarding the connection between on and offline lives are challenging the notions of what constitutes real experience. In reference to gender, sexuality and sexual behavior, the ability to play with these ideas has resulted in a questioning of how virtual experience may affect one's offline emotions. As McRae states, at its best, virtual sex not only complicates but drastically unsettles the division between mind, body, and self that has become a comfortable truism in Western metaphysics. When projected into virtuality, mind, body and self all become consciously-manufactured constructs through which individuals interact with each other.

The identities that people define in the social web are not necessarily facets of their offline self. Studies have shown that people lie in online dating services. In the case of social network services such as Facebook, companies are even proposing to sell 'friends' as a way to increase a user's visibility, calling into question even more the reliability of a person's 'social identity'.

Van Gelder reported a famous incident occurring on a computer conferencing system during the early 80s where a male psychiatrist posed as Julie, a female psychologist with multiple disabilities including deafness, blindness, and serious facial disfigurement. Julie endeared herself to the computer conferencing community, finding psychological and emotional support from many members. The psychiatrist's choice to present differently was sustained by drawing upon the unbearable stigma attached to Julie's multiple disabilities as justification for not meeting face-to-face. Lack of visual cues allowed the identity transformation to continue, with the psychiatrist also assuming the identity of Julie's husband, who adamantly refused to allow anyone to visit Julie when she claimed to be seriously ill. This example highlights the ease with which identity may be constructed, transformed, and sustained by the textual nature of online interaction and the visual anonymity it affords.

Catfishing is a way for a user to create a fake online profile, sometimes with fake photos and information, in order to enter into a relationship, intimate or platonic, with another user. Catfishing became popular in mainstream culture through the MTV reality show "".

A problem facing anyone who hopes to build a positive online reputation is that reputations are site-specific; for example, one's reputation on eBay cannot be transferred to Slashdot.

Multiple proposals have been made to build an identity management infrastructure into the Web protocols. All of them require an effective public key infrastructure so that the identity of two separate manifestations of an online identity (say, one on Wikipedia and another on Twitter) are probably one and the same.

OpenID, an open, decentralized standard for authenticating users is used for access control, allowing users to log on to different services with the same digital identity. These services must allow and implement OpenID.

Given the malleability of online identities, some economists have expressed surprise that flourishing trading sites (such as eBay) have developed on the Internet. When two pseudonymous identities propose to enter into an online transaction, they are faced with the prisoner's dilemma: the deal can succeed only if the parties are willing to trust each other, but they have no rational basis for doing so. But successful Internet trading sites have developed reputation management systems, such as eBay's feedback system, which record transactions and provide the technical means by which users can rate each other's trustworthiness. However, users with malicious intent can still cause serious problems on such websites.

An online reputation is the perception that one generates on the Internet based on their digital footprint. Digital footprints accumulate through all of the content shared, feedback provided and information that created online. Due to the fact that if someone has a bad online reputation, he can easily change his pseudonym, new accounts on sites such as eBay or Amazon are usually distrusted. If an individual or company wants to manage their online reputation, they will face many more difficulties. This is why a merchant on the web having a brick and mortar shop is usually more trusted.

Ultimately, online identity cannot be completely free from the social constraints that are imposed in the real world. As Westfall (2000, p. 160) discusses, "the idea of truly departing from social hierarchy and restriction does not occur on the Internet (as perhaps suggested by earlier research into the possibilities presented by the Internet) with identity construction still shaped by others. Westfall raises the important, yet rarely discussed, issue of the effects of literacy and communication skills of the online user." Indeed, these skills or the lack thereof have the capacity to shape one's online perception as they shape one's perception through a physical body in the "real world."

<START>This issue of gender and sexual reassignment raises the notion of disembodiment and its associated implications. "Disembodiment" is the idea that once the user is online, the need for the body is no longer required, and the user can participate separately from it. This ultimately relates to a sense of detachment from the identity defined by the physical body. In cyberspace, many aspects of sexual identity become blurred and are only defined by the user. Questions of truth will therefore be raised, particularly in reference to online dating and virtual sex. As [Q113843169|McRae] states, "Virtual sex allows for a certain freedom of expression, of physical presentation and of experimentation beyond one's own real-life limits". At its best, it not only complicates but drastically unsettles the division between mind, body and self in a manner only possible through the construction of an online identity.

The future of online anonymity depends on how an identity management infrastructure is developed. [Q6503343|Law enforcement officials] often express [COREF:Q6503343|their] opposition to online anonymity and pseudonymity, which [COREF:Q6503343|they] view as an open invitation to [Q2159907|criminals] who wish to disguise [COREF:Q2159907|their] identities. Therefore, [COREF:Q6503343|they] call for an identity management infrastructure that would irrevocably tie online identity to a person's legal identity]; in most such proposals, the system would be developed in tandem with a secure national identity document. [Q92747|Eric Schmidt], [Q484876|CEO] of [Q95|Google], has stated that the [Q356|[Q356|Google+] social network] is intended to be exactly such an identity system. The controversy resulting from [Q356|Google+]'s policy of requiring users to sign in using legal names has been dubbed the "nymwars".

[Unknown1|Online [Q1021386|civil rights advocates]], in contrast, argue that there is no need for a privacy-invasive system because technological solutions, such as reputation management systems, are already sufficient and are expected to grow in their sophistication and utility.<END>

An online predator is an Internet user who exploits other users' vulnerability, often for sexual or financial purposes. It is relatively easy to create an online identity which is attractive to people that would not normally become involved with the predator, but fortunately there are a few means by which you can make sure that a person whom you haven't met is actually who they say they are. Many people will trust things such as the style in which someone writes, or the photographs someone has on their web page as a way to identify that person, but these can easily be forged. Long-term Internet relationships may sometimes be difficult to sufficiently understand knowing what someone's identity is actually like.

The most vulnerable age group to online predators is often considered to be young teenagers or older children. "Over time - perhaps weeks or even months - the stranger, having obtained as much personal information as possible, grooms the child, gaining his or her trust through compliments, positive statements, and other forms of flattery to build an emotional bond." The victims often do not suspect anything until it is too late, as the other party usually misleads them to believe that they are of similar age.

The show Dateline on NBC has, overall, conducted three investigations on online predators. They had adults, posing online as teenage juveniles, engage in sexually explicit conversations with other adults (the predators) and arrange to meet them in person. But instead of meeting a teenager, the unsuspecting adult was confronted by Chris Hansen, an NBC News correspondent, arrested, and shown on nationwide television. "Dateline" held investigations in five different locations apprehending a total of 129 men in all.

Federal laws have been passed in the U.S. to assist the government when trying to catch online predators. Some of these include wiretapping, so online offenders can be caught in advance, before a child becomes a victim. In California, where one "Dateline" investigation took place, it is a misdemeanor for someone to have sexually-tinged conversations with a child online. The men who came to the house were charged with a felony because their intent was obvious.

An online identity that has acquired an excellent reputation is valuable for two reasons: first, one or more persons invested a great deal of time and effort to build the identity's reputation; and second, other users look to the identity's reputation as they try to decide whether it is sufficiently trustworthy. It is therefore unsurprising that online identities have been put up for sale at online auction sites. However, conflicts arise over the ownership of online identities. Recently, a user of a massively multiplayer online game called EverQuest, which is owned by Sony Online Entertainment, Inc., attempted to sell his EverQuest identity on eBay. Sony objected, asserting that the character is Sony's intellectual property, and demanded the removal of the auction; under the terms of the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), eBay could have become a party to a copyright infringement lawsuit if it failed to comply. Left unresolved is a fundamental question: Who owns an online identity created at a commercial Web site? Does an online identity belong to the person who created it, or to the company that owns the software used to create the identity?

NZR K class (1877)

The NZR K class of 1877 was the first example of American-built locomotives to be used on New Zealand's rail network. Their success coloured locomotive development in New Zealand until the end of steam.

<START>In [DATETIME|1877], the new [Q5096994|Chief Mechanical Engineer] of the [Q538101|NZR], [Unknown1|Allison D. Smith] required additional motive power for the fledgling Government system. It had been intended to order more [Q6956212|[Q6956212|J Class] locomotives] which were of [Q21|English] design. However, [Unknown1|Mr Smith] was adamant [Q30|American] locomotives would be much more suitable for [Q664|New Zealand]'s conditions. [COREF:Unknown1|His] argument won (see [Q1363572|Vogel] railways), and an order was placed with the [Q2734911|Rogers Locomotive Works] of [Q1408|New Jersey], for [QUANTITY|two] tender locomotives with a wheel arrangement of 2-4-2. The initial [QUANTITY|two] [Q1961776|Rogers locos] were ordered prior to [Unknown1|Smith]’s appointment as [Unknown2|Locomotive [Q81096|Engineer]] on [DATETIME|10 April 1877] ([COREF:Unknown1|he] had been [Q2462658|manager] of the [Q23661|Wellington] section), and were ordered through [Q60|New York] [Q63755226|consulting engineer] [Q4773672|Walton Evans]. [COREF:Q1961776|The locomotives] were described by [Unknown3|R.D. Grant] as having the design hallmarks of [Q2734911|Roger]'s [Q66889825|Superintendent] [Unknown4|William H. Hudson], with [COREF:Unknown4|his] truck design innovations and [COREF:Unknown4|his] patented compensated springing throughout from the front bissel truck to the driving wheel springs and to the rear swinging truck.
Upon their arrival to [Q664|New Zealand], [COREF:Q1961776|the locomotives] created quite a stir with [COREF:Q1961776|their] bar frames, [Q11303546|Gothic style] wooden cabs, locomotive bell, ornate embellishments and, rakish appearances which were at odds with the traditional [Q21|English] locomotive appearance in [Q664|New Zealand] at the time and were described by [Q1930187|journalist] [Q16773145|Charles Rous-Marten] as "a watch with all its works outside". One [Q79990|Christchurch] paper suggested that [COREF:Q1961776|they] needed a glass case to protect [COREF:Q1961776|them] from the weather. [COREF:Q1961776|They] looked flimsy because of the bar frames rather than the heavier plate frames of the [Q6956212|Js]. In addition, this [QUANTITY|first] pair, [Unknown5|K 87 "Lincoln"] and [Unknown6|K 88 "Washington"], reputedly wore a kaleidoscope of colours – [Q3133|green], [Q1088|blue], [Q943|yellow], [Q3142|red], [Q3257809|purple], and [Q208045|gold] in addition to their [Q7381971|Russian Iron] boiler jackets. The [Q804868|Baldwin] and [Q2734911|Rogers] locomotives reflected the styling adopted in the [DATETIME|1870s] by [Q30|[Q846570|American]] [Q13235160|builders] with elements from the [Q502163|Renaissance Revival] and [Q911397|[Q911397|Neo-Baroque] architectural styles], and with [Q212940|Islamic] [Q247492|Moorish] (from [Q47476|Alhambra]) influences. Bold colours and painted decorations were used.

After arrival in the [Q120755|South Island] at [Q911909|Lyttelton], the locomotives were quickly put into service. [Unknown5|K 87 "Lincoln"] quickly distinguished [COREF:Unknown5|itself] by hauling the [QUANTITY|first] bogie-carriage passenger train, and both the locomotives soon earned a reputation as fast and free runners, with mild coal consumption. [Unknown6|K 88 "Washington"] hauled the [QUANTITY|first] train between [Q79990|Christchurch] and [Q133073|Dunedin] in [DATETIME|1878] on the just-completed [Q6350718|Main South Line], assisted by the [Q6956204|Double Fairlie] "[Unknown7|Josephine]" south of [Q4782|Oamaru] until "[Unknown7|Josephine]" had to be taken off the train due to mechanical issues - caused by how [Unknown6|K 88] was being driven by [DESC:Unknown8|[COREF:Unknown6|its] [Q2775569|[Q352388|driver]]]. [QUANTITY|Six] more of [COREF:Q1961776|the class] was ordered from the [Q2734911|Rogers Locomotive Works], numbered from [QUANTITY|92] through [QUANTITY|97] before [Unknown5|K's 87] and [Unknown6|88] had entered service - [COREF:Unknown5|the former] being ordered in [DATETIME|January 1878] while [COREF:Unknown6|the latter] entered service in [DATETIME|March 1878], such was [Unknown1|Allison Smiths] faith in the type of engine [COREF:Unknown1|he] had ordered. [Unknown1|Allison Smiths] faith was well placed with railway authorities regarding the first two K's as "infinitely superior to the [Q21|English] locomotives" in operation during the same period. The [QUANTITY|second] batch of locomotives entered service in the [Q120755|South Island] and contained almost no differences to the [QUANTITY|first] [QUANTITY|two], albeit they were not given names and there is no record of them wearing the same kaleidoscope livery (it is likely [Unknown5|K 87] and [Unknown6|K 88] had been repainted by this time also). In [DATETIME|1883], due to [COREF:Q1961776|its] design characteristics, the [Q1961776|K class] was the only class of engine officially permitted to run at [QUANTITY|35] miles per hour in ordinary service.

As more powerful locomotives arrived on the railway system, increasingly of [Q30|American] origin from [Q804868|Baldwin], the [Q1961776|K class] became relegated from the top expresses and cascaded down to express trains on secondary lines. [QUANTITY|Two] of the K's, [Unknown9|K 93] and [Unknown10|K 96], were transferred to the [Q118863|North Island] during this time. Beginning just after [DATETIME|1900] [COREF:Q1961776|the class] started receiving new [Q538101|NZR]-built boilers to replace [COREF:Q1961776|their] [Q2734911|Rogers]-built wagon-top boiler. The [Q120755|South Island] locomotives gained boilers of a [Q686046|Belpaire] design, while the [Q118863|North Island] pair received round-top boilers. All the new boilers were pressed to [QUANTITY|160]psi, an increase over the original boiler's [QUANTITY|130]psi. By this time all the locomotives had received [Q3257938|Westinghouse] brake equipment also. It was during this time that some of the [Q1961776|K class], having been relegated to the [Unknown11|Kingston-Gore branch], began earning a reputation for the [Q266101|Kingston-Invercargill express train] which earned the name "[OPTIONAL:Q266101|Kingston Flyer]".<END>

The days of the K class in service were over during the 1920s. Both the North Island examples, plus K 87 "Lincoln" had been withdrawn as early as 1922. The others managed to linger on for a few more years yet, with the last two, K 92 and K 95, not withdrawn until 1927. As was customary at the time, the locomotives were set aside pending disposal, whatever form that may have taken. All remaining South Island class members lasted long enough to be dumped as embankment protection, something which began in 1926.

Three of the Rogers K class have so far been exhumed and entered into preservation. The first and most notable of these locomotives is K 88 "Washington", which was exhumed from its river grave by the Southland Vintage Car Club on 19 and 20 January 1974. There were a number of loose plans regarding the locomotive's future but these came to nothing. The locomotive wreck was threatened with being pushed back into the river until The Plains Vintage Railway & Historical Museum came up with ambitious plans to restore it back to working order. Beginning in July 1974, they achieved this goal in on the 7 November 1981 proving that the restoration of exhumed locomotives was possible. It was recommissioned on the 25 November the following year. However, on 24 September 1987 the boiler of K 88 (which was the boiler that it had been recovered from the Oreti River with) was condemned, and it was not until 30 March 2002 that K 88 was once again in working order, this time with a new Belpaire-style all-welded boiler and wearing an interpretation of the kaleidoscope colours.

The other two locomotives exhumed so far are K 94, exhumed by a private owner and moved to The Plains Railway on 21 April 1986. It is in storage in an un-restored state with no active plans for restoration. And K 92, recovered in 1985 by the Fiordland Vintage Machinery Club for their Museum's railway venture on the shores of Lake Te Anau. Partially restored in Te Anau the venture fell through before the locomotive had been fully completed and subsequently the locomotive was put up for sale, with the restoration being completed in Dunedin. Purchased by Colin Smith in 1998, the locomotive's restoration was completed and it is intended to recreate the old "Kingston Flyer" trains of the early 1900s at the Waimea Plains Railway. While waiting for the railway to be completed, K 92 has visited a number of railways in the South Island, with some of the more notable visits being those to the Kingston Flyer, an old haunt for K 92 where it triple headed with the two A class locomotives resident there, and also a visit to the Plains, home of K 88, where both locomotives were used together extensively.

Panteleimon Ponomarenko

Panteleimon Kondratyevich Ponomarenko (, ; 18 January 1984) was one of the leaders of Soviet partisan resistance in Belarus. He also served as an administrator at various positions within the Soviet government, including the leadership positions in Byelorussian and Kazakh SSRs.

Ponomarenko was born in khutor Shelkovskiy in Kuban oblast to an ethnic Ukrainian peasant family coming from Kharkov governorate. He fought in the Russian civil war and became a member of the Communist party in 1925.

From 1938 to 1947, Ponomarenko was the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Belorussia, and from 1944 to 1948, also the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Belarus. During the Great Purge he successfully defended Belarusian-language poets Yanka Kupala and Yakub Kolas from repressions, personally travelling to Stalin to appeal for their protection. The two poets were later awarded the Order of Lenin.

During this time he also assisted the National Jazz Orchestra in Minsk, inviting Eddie Rosner to lead it.

<START>During [Q362|World War II], [COREF:Q941748|he] was one of the [Q1251441|leaders] of the [Q2727209|Communist partisan units] within [Q7318|Nazi]-occupied [Q184|Belarus]. [COREF:Q941748|He] was granted the rank of [Q152951|Lieutenant general] in [DATETIME|March 1943].

According to the [Q36|Polish] [Q705173|Institute of National Remembrance], during that time [COREF:Q941748|he] also clashed with the [Q116080|Polish underground] and gave orders for [COREF:Q941748|his] troops to disarm [COREF:Q116080|them] and execute [COREF:Q116080|their] [Q189290|officers]. In this aspect, [COREF:Q705173|the institute] claims, the forces under [Q941748|Ponomarenko]'s command initiated a limited collaboration with the [Q7318|Nazi] occupation forces informing on members of the [Q116080|Polish underground].

From [DATETIME|16 October 1952] until [DATETIME|6 March 1953], [Q941748|Ponomarenko] was a member of the [Q842008|Politburo] (called [OPTIONAL:Q842008|Presidium] at the time) of the [Q79854|Communist Party of the Soviet Union].

From 26 October 1957 to 22 April 1959 Ponomarenko was the Soviet ambassador to India and Nepal, and from 30 June 1959 to 21 June 1962 to the Netherlands.

In his later years, Ponomarenko was a professor at the between 1964 and 1974.

**** ARTICLE #96: Archaeological Museum of Asturias (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1092869) *****
Archaeological Museum of Asturias

The Archaeological Museum of Asturias (Spanish: Museo Arqueológico de Asturias; Asturian: Muséu Arqueolóxicu d'Asturies) is housed in the 16th century Benedictine monastery of Saint Vicente in Oviedo, Asturias, Spain. Its findings include collections of the Asturian Neolithic, Megalithic, Bronze Age, Iron Age, Astur hill fort culture, Roman period, and of the Gothic, Pre-Romanesque and Romanesque periods of the Kingdom of Asturias. The museum also includes sections of Asturian Ethnography, Heraldry, Medieval and Modern Epigraphy, Spanish Numismatics, a European Medal Section, and Armor.

The museum falls under the Spanish Ministry of Education and Culture but is managed by the Council of Culture of the Government of the Principality of Asturias.

The museum underwent a series of refurbishment works beginning in 2004, being reinaugurated and reopened to the public on March 21, 2011.


The permanent exhibition narrates the history of the Asturian region from prehistory to the High and Late Middle Ages, through the material culture preserved in the museum, giving us a view of the different peoples that have inhabited this territory over its many centuries of history.

Archaeological investigations have revealed the subsistence strategies (hunting, fishing and foraging) and technical advances in the manufacture of tools of the prehistoric people who occupied caves and shelters near rivers. Of particular note is the presentation of the world of the Neanderthals, provided by the latest discoveries in the Asturian cave of El Sidrón. The enigmatic universe of the different mindsets finds its most eloquent expression in Paleolithic parietal art and furniture. In Asturias, images of great beauty are to be found in nearly fifty caves, where our remotest ancestors carved or painted animals, symbols and summary representations of the human body.

<START>From the [Q36422|Neolithic] up through the [Q11761|Bronze Age], a drastic cultural change occurred as compared to the traditional way of life of [Q40203|Paleolithic] societies. The people that populated our region about [QUANTITY|4,500] years ago felled forests, cleared the first fields for crops and opened up areas of pasture land for raising animals. Megaliths, with their ritualistic and territorial significance, became a part of the [Q3934|Asturian] landscape as a reflection of the complex new agricultural society. The intensive exploitation of [Q753|copper] mines and the expansion of the metallurgical phenomenon led to the development of increasingly complex societies. During this period, [Q3934|Asturias] began [COREF:Q3934|its] long history as a mining region.

The castros (fortified settlements) nowadays constitute one of the most visible elements of the [Q3934|Asturian] landscape, the typical habitat in [Q3934|Asturias] between the end of the [Q11761|Bronze Age] and [Q1747689|Roman] settlement, i.e., during the [Q11764|Iron Age]. The castros had an autonomous nature, with the defenses being the most outstanding boundary element, emblematic of these communities that appeared to be quite dissociated and divided into clans.

With the arrival of [Q1747689|Rome] to the distant lands bordering the [Q41573|Bay of Biscay] in the times of the [Q842606|[Q39018|emperor]] [Q1405|Augustus], [Q3934|Asturias] became part of the [Q2277|Roman Empire]. Under [Q2277|Roman] rule, [COREF:Q3934|the territory] became truly unified due to the creation of both urban and rural centers connected by an extensive network of roads. Profit from the [Q897|gold] mines focused [Q2277|Rome]'s attention on the western area of [COREF:Q3934|the region], exploiting deposits on a large scale. New economic and trade activities arose throughout [COREF:Q3934|the country], bringing about a change in the habits and customs of a traditionally mining and agricultural population. The presence of [Q2277|Rome] in [Q3934|Asturias] also marked [COREF:Q3934|our region]'s entrance into the cultural spheres of the classical world.<END>

The Kingdom of Asturias inaugurated the Middle Ages in this region. Royal sites, churches, monasteries and castles comprised the main centers of power of the monarchy and the early medieval aristocracy. However, most of the rural population lived in modest houses with simple household furnishings in small villages. The art of the Astur monarchy is noted for its architectural and ornamental originality. From the 13th century on, new urban centers and towns (Asturian polas) concentrated the population and centralized administrative, trade and craft activities. New Romanesque and Gothic churches were built in these cities, towns and villages. Towards the end of medieval times, there emerged a new aristocracy which played a major role in the political, economic and social life of the region.

Completing the exhibition a specific section entitled “From Collection to Museum”, which looks at how the Museum came to be, its history running almost parallel to the beginnings of scientific archeology in the region.

In an annex to this thematic area is a tribute to the figure of Friar Benito Feijoo y Montenegro, extraordinary figure of the Spanish Enlightenment and abbot of the Monastery of San Vicente. A Benedictine cell has been reconstructed in the grandest part of the old cloister, just like the one found in the Museum's former exhibition. In this way, we continue to recognize the most prolific essayist of the 18th century, whose intellectual work marked a milestone in the evolution of thought and science of that time.

Another section is devoted to the dissemination and appreciation of World Heritage sites in Asturias: Paleolithic cave art and monuments of the Asturian monarchy. Through a series of interactive screens and audiovisuals, visitors are given relevant information on these heritage sites as well as the various archaeological routes that can be taken to enjoy this cultural legacy.

The confiscation of church property in 1837 put a great number of religious works of art into circulation and throughout the 19th century the Asturian Commission on Monuments took on the task of collecting the remains of those abandoned and sold-off monasteries and churches. These pieces constituted the source of the Museum of Antiquities’ collection, which gradually grew through the donations made by several of its members, as well as by collectors and scholars concerned with the past.

In its active work, the museum was mainly involved in the restoration of pre-Romanesque churches, collecting pieces from the ruins of some of these buildings. Once in the 20th century, the development of scientific archeology meant expanding the horizon towards prehistoric times, after Palaeolithic cave art was discovered in Asturias.

Throughout the 20th century, the museum's collection grew significantly as the result of archaeological excavations in Asturias. Private collections were also donated, adding to the holdings of the former Commission on Monuments. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the Provincial Government of Oviedo purchased a variety of wooden statues, furniture and other objects. Major purchases included three collections: that of the heirs of Soto Cortés, comprising all kinds of archaeological artifacts; the numismatic collection belonging to Pedro Hurlé Mansó; and the collection of arms and coins from the heirs of Tomás Fernández Bataller.

Research carried out since the 1970s has steadily expanded the museum's collection from the Paleolithic Age, the Metal Ages and the Roman period. The birth of archeology management, which has developed significantly since the 1990s, has led to a great deal of material from all ages being incorporated. This especially includes objects from the Middle Ages, collected from the historic centers of Asturian cities and towns, as well as from the numerous churches and monasteries which have been examined prior to their restoration.

The precedent for the current museum lies in the Provincial Commission on Monuments, created in 1845, which carried out the first actions to protect the monuments and cultural heritage of Asturias, opening the first museum in 1870 in the Convent of San Francisco, which has since ceased to exist, with pieces collected throughout the Asturian region as well as from private donations.

The current museum dates from 1944, although it was not opened to the public until 1952 in the cloister of the former Monastery of San Vicente. The collection has since grown due to excavations, donations and purchases of pieces. Given the condition of the building, in 1998 the Ministry of Culture started the process of refurbishing and expanding the museum. Works to carry out the project designed by architects Fernando Pardo Calvo and Bernardo García Tapia were begun in 2004. After an investment of 16 million euros, the remodeling has increased the museum's gross floor area to 5,810 m², of which 2,013 m² are dedicated to its permanent exhibition.

At the same time, these works led to the discovery of a 1.6 m-high bastion from the original 8th-century wall that surrounded Oviedo. The arcades of the cloister rest on the remains of this city wall. The initial project for the works had to be modified to leave these parts of the wall exposed as yet another of the museum's treasures. The find supports historian Juan Uría Ríu's hypothesis regarding the course of this wall, erected in the times of Alfonso II.

Since 1952, the museum has occupied the cloister of the former Monastery of San Vicente, a building with a complex history related to the origin of the city. The cloister was declared a national monument in 1934

The Monastery of San Vicente is believed to have been founded in 761, during the reign of Fruela I. Only remnants of that first building have survived. However, the cloister, begun in the 1530s under the direction of master builder Juan de Badajoz, the Younger and completed by Juan de Cerecedo, the Elder and Juan de Cerecedo, the Younger in the 1570s, remains standing.

Eusebius (praepositus sacri cubiculi)

Eusebius (died 361 AD) was a high-ranking officer of the Roman Empire, holding the position of "praepositus sacri cubiculi" during the rule of Emperor Constantius II (337-361).

Eusebius held the position of "praepositus sacri cubiculi" in 337, when Constantine I died; he concealed the will of the Emperor. Eusebius became a supporter of Arianism, influencing the empress and many other eunuchs. He entered then at the service of one of Constantine's sons and successors, Constantius II, with whom he shared the support for Arianism and on whom he exerted a great influence.

<START>In [DATETIME|354] [Q339512|Eusebius] was sent by [Q46418|Constantius II] to talk to [Q102105|Pope Liberius] and then attended at the meeting between [COREF:Q46418|the [NO_COREF_ALT:Q39018|Emperor]] and [COREF:Q102105|the [NO_COREF_ALT:Q19546|Pope]]. [COREF:Q339512|He] sent money to the [Q12859263|orator] [Q263892|Libanius] in exile and, in [DATETIME|355], helped those [Q83922|Arian] [Q29182|bishops] who plotted against [Q44024|Athanasius of Alexandria].

[Q339512|Eusebius] followed [Q46418|Constantius] into [Q38060|Gaul] ([DATETIME|353]-[DATETIME|354]) and then to [Q490|Milan] ([DATETIME|354]). Here [COREF:Q339512|he] plotted against [Q46418|Constantius]' cousin, brother-in-law and [Q188751|Caesar], [Q352506|Constantius Gallus]; [Q46418|Constantius] ordered [COREF:Q339512|him] to go to [Q4656|Pula], where [Q352506|Gallus] was imprisoned, to question [COREF:Q352506|him] about [COREF:Q352506|his] rule in the East.

[Q339512|Eusebius] enriched [COREF:Q339512|himself] taking the properties of those who were put to death on accusations of treason; when [Q83460|general] [Q731413|Ursicinus] refused to give [COREF:Q339512|him] as a present [COREF:Q731413|his] house in [Q200441|Antioch], in [DATETIME|359], [Q339512|Eusebius] had [COREF:Q731413|him] recalled from [COREF:Q731413|his] office as "[Q109960|magister equitum]", having [Q2210015|Sabinianus] as a substitute.<END>

Eusebius was together with Constantius until the Emperor died, in 361. The new Emperor, Julian, set up the Chalcedon tribunal to judge all those officers of Constantius' who had been suspected of corrupt conduct, in particular in the case of the trial and execution of Gallus (Julian's half-brother); Eusebius was accused of plotting against Gallus, was found guilty, and was put to death.

HelioVolt

HelioVolt Corporation was a privately held U.S. solar energy company based in Austin, Texas, that suspended operations in 2014. The company manufactured photovoltaic (PV) solar modules using a thin film semiconductor process based on copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) to produce CIGS solar cells. HelioVolt manufactured these thin film modules for commercial rooftop, utility-scale ground mount, residential, building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) and custom installations. The company raised over $230 million in investment, including over $80 million by SK Group.

HelioVolt Corporation was founded in 2001 to develop and commercialize its FASST® process for applying CIGS thin-film photovoltaics directly onto conventional construction materials. The company’s FASST® process,

based on semiconductor printing, was invented by HelioVolt founder Dr. Billy J. Stanbery, an expert in the materials science of CIGS and related compound semiconductors. FASST® is a patented manufacturing process for CIGS synthesis.

HelioVolt was producing thin film solar PV modules for commercial rooftop, utility-scale ground mount, residential, BIPV and custom installations. HelioVolt suspended operations in 2014 and the contents of the Austin facility were auctioned in January 2015

Large-scale investment in HelioVolt began with $8 million in Series A funding from New Enterprise Associates in 2005.

<START>A further $[QUANTITY|77 million] was added in a Series B funding round co-led by [Unknown1|Paladin Capital Group] and the [Unknown2|Masdar Clean Tech Fund] in [DATETIME|August 2007].
The Series B funding round was closed for a total of $[QUANTITY|101 million] in [DATETIME|October 2007]
with investments from [Unknown3|Sequel Venture Partners], [Q3879074|Noventi], and [Q20971519|Passport Capital].

[Q16842261|HelioVolt] developed a new way to manufacture thin-film [Q15023366|CIGS] semiconductor coatings for solar panels, based on research into the fundamental device physics of the [Q15023366|CIGS] semiconductor material.

Conventional semiconductor processing requires a vacuum process to deposit the semiconductor film on the substrate. The need for vacuum chambers makes this a lengthy batch-oriented production process. [Q16842261|HelioVolt] developed a nanomaterial-based coating that could be sprayed onto a wide variety of substrates without requiring a vacuum. Non-vacuum or atmospheric deposition processes offer a combination of lower costs, process simplicity and reduced manufacturing times. [COREF:Q16842261|The company]'s
FASST manufacturing process won a [Unknown4|Nanotech Briefs] "[Unknown5|Nano 50]"
[Q11468|nanotechnology] award in [DATETIME|2006]. In [DATETIME|2008], [Q16842261|HelioVolt] and [Q1856153|NREL] won an [Unknown6|R&D 100 Award] for [COREF:|their] innovative Thin Film Solar Printing Process, as well as [DATETIME|the year]'s coveted "[Unknown7|R&D Magazine"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Editor’s Choice] for [Unknown8|Most Revolutionary Technology].<END>

HelioVolt produced thin film solar cells that could convert 14 percent of the sunlight that hit them into electricity, and solar modules with conversion efficiencies of above 12 percent, as certified by NREL.

[COREF:Q1987694|The parish] is combined with the parishes of [Q1779774|Abington Pigotts], [Q1987694|Guilden Morden] and [Q2525645|Tadlow] to form [Unknown1|"[Unknown1|The Mordens]" ward], which is represented on [Q7566485|South Cambridgeshire District Council] by [QUANTITY|one] [Q708492|councillor].

The parish of [Q1987694|Guilden Morden] is long and thin in shape covering an area of [QUANTITY|1052] ha in the very south-western corner of [Q23112|Cambridgeshire]. [COREF:Q1987694|The parish]'s long western border largely follows the course of the [Q944772|River Cam] from the point where [COREF:Q944772|it] rises at [Unknown2|Ruddery Spring], and which separates [COREF:Q1987694|it] from [Q3410|Hertfordshire] and [Q23143|Bedfordshire].

The area has been occupied for at least 2000 years and probably much longer; an axehead dating from 6000 BC has been found in the parish. A significant cemetery dating from Roman times has also been found in the south of the parish, containing at least 180 burials and indicating an important nearby settlement. The Guilden Morden boar, an Anglo-Saxon copper alloy figure of a boar that may have once served as the crest of a helmet, was found around 1864 or 1865 in a grave. The Saxon village was probably built after that of its neighbour Steeple Morden from which it has been separate since at least the Norman Conquest.

The hamlet of Odsey on the Baldock to Royston road was formerly home to a Cistercian grange. A hamlet named Redreth was listed until the 14th century, probably south of the village and perhaps deserted as a result of the Black Death.

The name is derived from the Old English "Gylden More Dun", meaning "Golden" (rich or productive) "Moor Hill".

The manor here belonged for several centuries to the Hasilden family. Thomas Hasilden (c.1322-1401) had a Royal grant of free warren in his manors of Steeple and Guilden Morden in 1374. He was then resident at Morden Hall, an ancient mansion. He was Comptroller of the household of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, and was retained for life to served him in peace or in war. He also held the manor of Soham in Cambridgeshire from the Duke as superior. In July 1381 he was commanded to meet the Duke at Berwick-upon-Tweed with seventy men-at-arms and sixty lances from his estates. He was a Knight of the Shire for Cambridgeshire in 1384 and also served in four other Parliaments. The manor continued in this family until Francis Hasilden, High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire in 1509 (died early in 1522) settled his estates on his only child Frances who conveyed them by her marriage to Sir Robert Peyton, knt., of Iselham.

The parish church of Guilden Morden has been dedicated to St Mary since at least the 15th century. The oldest parts of the nave date back to the 13th century, with the majority of the building added in the 14th century. The present building consists of a chancel, aisled and clerestoried nave with south porch, and a west tower with a short spire. The tower dates from the 15th century, and the present spire replaced an older one in 1972. The basin of the font is 12th century.
In 1522 Francis Hasilden, Lord of the Manor of Guilden Morden, was buried in the north aisle "before Jesus's Altar" in a tomb which cost his estate £20 sterling.

In the village there is one open pub the King Edward VII. There is a second pub, named the Three Tuns, which was open by 1851 and closed in 2013; it is currently (2018) the subject of a campaign in the village seeking to purchase and reopen it. Next to the King Edward there is a small village shop, which is now closed. The Six Bells pub, which opened next to the church before 1801, closed some time in the 1960s or 70s, and The Black Swan opened on Swan Lane in the late 19th century and closed in the 20th century. The village's other former pubs are The Pear Tree (47 New Road), The Chestnuts, The Pig and Whistle (63 High Street), The Fox, and The Black Horse (Potton Road).

Guilden Morden Primary School, founded in 1847, opened on its current site in 1974. The school has around 120 children from reception to year 6. The children then go on to Bassingbourn Village College in most cases. In addition the village has a pre-school.

A fete is held each September on the recreation ground in aid of the village hall.

**** ARTICLE #115: Rosaline (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11087023) *****
Rosaline

Rosaline () is a fictional character mentioned in William Shakespeare's tragedy "Romeo and Juliet" (1597). She is the niece of Lord Capulet. Although an unseen character, her role is important: Romeo's unrequited love for Rosaline leads him to try to catch a glimpse of her at a gathering hosted by the Capulet family, during which he first spots Juliet.

Scholars generally compare Romeo's short-lived love of Rosaline with his later love of Juliet. The poetry Shakespeare writes for Rosaline is much weaker than that for Juliet. Scholars believe Romeo's early experience with Rosaline prepares him for his relationship with Juliet. Later performances of "Romeo and Juliet" have painted different pictures of Romeo and Rosaline's relationship, as filmmakers have experimented with making Rosaline a more visible character.

Before Romeo meets Juliet, he loves Rosaline, Capulet's niece and Juliet's cousin. He describes her as wonderfully beautiful: "The all-seeing sun / ne'er saw her match since first the world begun." Rosaline, however, chooses to remain chaste; Romeo says: "She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow / Do I live dead that live to tell it now." This is the source of his depression, and he makes his friends unhappy; Mercutio comments: "That same pale, hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, torments him so that he will sure run mad." Benvolio urges Romeo to sneak into a Capulet gathering where, he claims, Rosaline will look like "a crow" alongside the other beautiful women. Romeo agrees, but doubts Benvolio's assessment. After Romeo sees Juliet his feelings suddenly change: "Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight / For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night." Because their relationship is sudden and secret, Romeo's friends and Friar Laurence continue to speak of his affection for Rosaline throughout much of the play.

Rosaline is a variant of Rosalind, a name of Old French origin: ("hros" = "horse", "lind" = "soft, tender"). When it was imported into English it was thought to be from the Latin "rosa linda" ("lovely rose"). Romeo sees Rosaline as the embodiment of the rose because of her name and her apparent perfections. The name Rosaline commonly appears in Petrarchan sonnets, a form of poetry Romeo uses to woo Juliet and to describe both Rosaline and Juliet. Since Rosaline is unattainable, she is a perfect subject for this style; but Romeo's attempt at it is forced and weak. By the time he meets Juliet his poetic ability has improved considerably.

<START>Rosaline is used as a name for only [QUANTITY|one] other [Q692|Shakespearean] character—[QUANTITY|one] of the main female figures in "[Q128610|Love's Labours Lost]" ([DATETIME|1598]), although [OPTIONAL:Q60834955|Rosalin"d"] is the name of the main female character in "[Q237572|As You Like It]". [Q16308156|Scholars] have found similarities between them: both are described as beautiful, and both have a way of avoiding men's romantic advances. [Q63537266|Rosaline] in "[Q128610|Love's Labours Lost]" constantly rebuffs [COREF:Q63537266|her] suitor's advances and [Q673361|Romeo]'s [Q7367264|Rosaline] remains distant and chaste in [COREF:Q673361|his] brief descriptions of [COREF:Q7367264|her]. These similarities have led some to wonder whether they are based on a woman [Q692|Shakespeare] actually knew, possibly the [Q30607539|[Q9197856|Dark Lady]] described in [COREF:Q692|his] [Q80056|sonnets], but there is no strong evidence of this connection.

[Q485178|Analysts] note that [Q7367264|Rosaline] acts as a plot device, by motivating [Q673361|Romeo] to sneak into the [Q2937718|Capulet] party where [COREF:Q673361|he] will meet [Q1092632|Juliet]. Without [COREF:Q7367264|her], their meeting would be unlikely. [Q7367264|Rosaline] thus acts as the impetus to bring the "star-cross'd lovers" to their deaths—[COREF:Q7367264|she] is crucial in shaping their fate (a common theme of [COREF:Q83186|the [NO_COREF_ALT:Q25379|play]]). Ironically, [COREF:Q7367264|she] remains oblivious of [COREF:Q7367264|her] role.

[Q4263842|Literary critics] often compare [Q673361|Romeo]'s love for [Q7367264|Rosaline] with [COREF:Q673361|his] feelings for [Q1092632|Juliet]. Some see [Q673361|Romeo]'s supposed love for [Q7367264|Rosaline] as childish as compared with [COREF:Q673361|his] true love for [Q1092632|Juliet]. Others argue that the apparent difference in [Q673361|Romeo]'s feelings shows [Q692|Shakespeare]'s improving skill. Since [Q692|Shakespeare] is thought to have written early drafts of [COREF:Q83186|the [NO_COREF_ALT:Q25379|play]] in [DATETIME|1591], and then picked them up again in [DATETIME|1597] to create the final copy, the change in [Q673361|Romeo]'s language for [Q7367264|Rosaline] and [Q1092632|Juliet] may mirror [Q692|Shakespeare]'s increased skill as a [Q214917|playwright]: the younger [Q692|Shakespeare] describing [Q7367264|Rosaline], and the more experienced describing [Q1092632|Juliet]. In this view, a careful look at [COREF:Q83186|the [NO_COREF_ALT:Q25379|play]] reveals that [Q673361|Romeo]'s love for [Q7367264|Rosaline] is not as petty as usually imagined.<END>

Critics also note the ways in which Romeo's relationship with Rosaline prepares him for meeting Juliet. Before meeting Rosaline, Romeo despises all Capulets, but afterwards looks upon them more favourably. He experiences the dual feelings of hate and love in the one relationship. This prepares him for the more mature relationship with Juliet—one fraught by the feud between Montagues and Capulets. Romeo expresses the conflict of love and hate in Act 1, Scene 1, comparing his love for Rosaline with the feud between the two houses:

Psychoanalytic critics see signs of repressed childhood trauma in Romeo's love for Rosaline. She is of a rival house and is sworn to chastity. Thus he is in an impossible situation, one which will continue his trauma if he remains in it. 
Although he acknowledges its ridiculous nature, he refuses to stop loving her. Psychoanalysts view this as a re-enactment of his failed relationship with his mother. Rosaline's absence is symbolic of his mother's absence and lack of affection for him. Romeo's love for Juliet is similarly hopeless, for she is a Capulet and Romeo pursues his relationship with her; the difference being that Juliet reciprocates. This does not seem likely seeing as his mother died of grief after his banishment, indicating that she probably loved him deeply.

Rosaline has been portrayed in various ways over the centuries. Theophilus Cibber's 1748 version of "Romeo and Juliet" replaced references to Rosaline with references to Juliet. This, according to critics, took out the "love at first sight" moment at the Capulet feast. In the 1750s, actor and theatre director David Garrick also eliminated references to Rosaline from his performances, as many saw Romeo's quick replacement of her as immoral. However, in Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 film version of "Romeo and Juliet", Romeo sees Rosaline (played by Paola Tedesco) first at the Capulet feast and then Juliet, of whom he becomes immediately enamoured. This scene suggests that love is short and superficial. Rosaline also appears in Renato Castellani's 1954 film version. In a brief non-Shakespearean scene, Rosaline (Dagmar Josipovitch) gives Romeo a mask at Capulet's celebration, and urges him to leave disguised before harm comes to him. Other filmmakers keep Rosaline off-camera in stricter accordance with Shakespeare's script. Rosaline also appears in the 2013 film adaptation of "Romeo and Juliet".

Robert Nathan's 1966 romantic comedy, "Juliet in Mantua", presents Rosaline as a fully developed character. In this sequel, in which Romeo and Juliet did "not" die, the pair live ten years later in exile in Mantua. After they are forgiven and return to Verona, they learn that Rosaline is now married to Count Paris, and both couples must confront their disillusionment with their marriages. Another play, "After Juliet", written by Scottish playwright Sharman Macdonald, tells the story of Rosaline after Romeo dies. A main character in this play, she struggles with her loss and turns away the advances of Benvolio, who has fallen in love with her. Macdonald's daughter, Keira Knightley, played Rosaline in the play's 1999 premiere.

Rosaline is the main protagonist of the 2017 American drama series "Still Star-Crossed" she is portrayed by actress Lashana Lynch.

After much literary criticism by media and [Q193891|veterans], [COREF:Q37999506|his] achievements were recognized in [DATETIME|2010s].

[Q37999506|Sheikh Mohammad Anwar] was born in [Q11739|[Q11739|Lahore], [Q2629708|Punjab], [Q668|India]], on [DATETIME|12 September 1920].

He joined and commissioned in the Royal Indian Navy as a Sub-Lieutenant in 1941, and briefly served in World War II's Burma theatre in 1942–43. After the India's partition that resulted in the independence of Pakistan on 14 August 1947, Lt Anwar joined the Pakistan Navy, and was directed to attend the Naval War College in Rhodes Island, United States, in 1958. After graduating from the Naval War College in 1959, Cdr. Anwar served as an exchange officer in the United States Navy's surface warships for two months. In 1960, Cdr Anwar served as base commander for the PNS Bahadur, a training establishment.

In 1962, Capt. Anwar was appointed by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) for a diplomatic assignment, and briefly tenured as naval attaché at the Embassy of Pakistan in Washington, D.C. in the United States until 1964.

In 1965, Anwar was appointed as senior fleet commander when he took over the command of the Pakistan Fleet (COMPAK). During the second war with India in 1965, Cdre. Anwar was the officer in tactical command of the 25th Destroyer Squadron who led the attack and raid radar station used by the Indian Air Force in Dwarka, Gujarat in India.

In 1968, the United States honoured him with their highest military award, the Legion of Merit, presented by then-U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan Eugene Locke. In 1969, he was appointed as chairman of Karachi Port Trust which he remained until 1970.

In 1971, Cdre. Anwar served in the command of the Marines Corps for a short period, and was later appointed as commandant of the Pakistan Marine Academy until 1975.

Despite his role and heroic feats in 1965 war, his role in the Navy was less known and was hardly recognised in the Navy. He was unknown to the public, and it was not until 1990s when the ISPR highlighted his role as a war hero when releasing the telefilm bearing the same name of operation that was aired on the STN; his role was played by Talat Hussain in the 1990s.

His death also went unnoticed in 1977, and it was only in 2016, when the Pakistan Navy officially recognised his services on their official page on Facebook.

Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act

<START>The [Q520837|Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act] ([OPTIONAL:Q520837|ATPDEA]) is a trade preference system by which [Q30|the [Q30|United States]] grants duty-free access to a wide range of exports from [QUANTITY|four] [DESC:Q490417|[Q5456|Andean] countries]: [Q750|Bolivia], [Q739|Colombia], [Q736|Ecuador] and [Q419|Peru]. [COREF:Q520837|It] was enacted on [DATETIME|October 31, 2002] as a replacement for the similar [Unknown1|Andean Trade Preference Act] ([OPTIONAL:Unknown1|ATPA]). The purpose of [COREF:Q520837|this preference system] is to foster economic development in the [DESC:Q490417|[Q5456|Andean] countries] to provide alternatives to coca production. [Q750|Bolivia] has installed capacity to industrialize coca production and its derivatives, since coca has no narcotic effects, but [Q30|the [Q30|United States]] does not make any difference between coca and [Q41576|cocaine]. Thus, the [Q48525|U.S. government] eliminated this "preference".

On [DATETIME|December 4, 1991], under the [Q23505|George H. W. Bush] administration, [Q30|the [Q30|United States]] enacted the [Unknown1|Andean Trade Preference Act] ([OPTIONAL:Unknown1|ATPA]), eliminating tariffs on a number of products from [Q750|Bolivia], [Q739|Colombia], [Q736|Ecuador], and [Q419|Peru]. [COREF:Unknown1|Its] objective was the strengthening of legal industries in these countries as alternatives to drug production and trafficking. [COREF:Unknown1|The program] was renewed on [DATETIME|October 31, 2002] by the [Q23505|George W. Bush] administration as the [Q520837|Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act] ([OPTIONAL:Q520837|ATPDEA]). Under [COREF:Q520837|the renewed act], [Q5456|Andean] products exempted from tariffs increased from around [QUANTITY|5,600] to some [QUANTITY|6,300]. [Q520837|ATPDEA] was set to expire on [DATETIME|December 31, 2006], but was renewed by [Q11268|Congress] for [QUANTITY|six] months, up to [DATETIME|June 30, 2007]. An extension was granted on [DATETIME|June 28, 2007], this time for [QUANTITY|eight] months, until [DATETIME|February 29, 2008]. The [Q11268|U.S. Congress] passed a [QUANTITY|third] renewal for [QUANTITY|ten] months on [DATETIME|February 28, 2008], up to [DATETIME|December 31, 2008]. In [DATETIME|November 2008], [Q11696|U.S. President] [Q207|George W. Bush] asked [Q11268|Congress] to remove [Q750|Bolivia] from the agreement due to failure to cooperate in counternarcotics efforts. On [DATETIME|December 14, 2009], the [Q11701|United States House of Representatives] approved the extension of such plan for a period of [QUANTITY|one] year. The final version of the agreement, covering [Q736|Ecuadorian] products only, lapsed on [DATETIME|July 31, 2013] after [Q736|Ecuador] became ineligible.

The [Q520837|Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act] has fostered a rapid growth in trade between [Q30|the [Q30|United States]] and the [QUANTITY|four] [DESC:Q490417|[Q5456|Andean] nations]; [Q30|U.S.] exports to the region rose from $[QUANTITY|6.46 billion] in [DATETIME|2002] to $[QUANTITY|11.64 billion] in [DATETIME|2006], while imports grew from $[QUANTITY|9.61 billion] to $[QUANTITY|22.51 billion] in the same period. As of [DATETIME|2006] main [Q5456|Andean] exports to [Q30|the [Q30|United States]] under [Q520837|ATPDEA] were [Q22656|oil], apparel, [Q753|copper] cathodes, cut flowers, [Q897|gold] jewelry, [Q28367|asparagus], and [Q11002|sugar]. Of the [DATETIME|2006] total of [Q30|U.S.] imports under [Q520837|ATPDEA], [Q736|Ecuador] accounted for [QUANTITY|39]%, [Q739|Colombia] for [QUANTITY|36]%, [Q419|Peru] for [QUANTITY|24]%, and [Q750|Bolivia] for [QUANTITY|1]%. According to a [DATETIME|September 2006] [Q10870555|report] by the [Q839560|United States International Trade Commission], [Q520837|ATPDEA] has had a negative effect on the [Q30|U.S.] economy and [Q22855|consumers] as well as a small positive effect on drug-crop reduction and export-related job creation in the [Q5456|Andean] region. A [DATETIME|2006] [Q10870555|report] by the [Q628807|United States Department of Labor] stated that [Q520837|ATPDEA] does not appear to have had a negative impact on [Q30|U.S.] employment with the possible exception of some sectors of the cut flower industry.

**** ARTICLE #124: Glen Wilton, Virginia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18420178) *****
Glen Wilton, Virginia

Glen Wilton is an unincorporated community in Botetourt County, Virginia, United States.

Callie Furnace was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

Glen Wilton lies between the George Washington National Forest and the James River, whose headwaters are about four miles northeast with the most narrow part being approximately a mile south, near the beginning of Wood's Island, CSX Railroad and James River Division, running parallel to the river.

Glen Wilton is the only community in Virginia in which there are no public roads passing through.

Mountain trails lead southwest to Roaring Run and north to Iron Gate. During the flood of 1985, the town of Glen Wilton was isolated for more than 24 hours, an emergency route was established through the mountain to the town of Iron Gate: however, with the heavy rains eventually even the emergency route became impassable.

Settlers arrived to the area in the 1700s as indicated by land transactions. There is evidence of Native Americans living in this area as well. A couple of Indian burial sites still exist today; Everett L.Tucker, Sr., now deceased, had a collection of Indian arrowheads, pieces of pottery, various tools and other Indian artifacts that he had found while walking to these sites (he never disturbed any of the graves during his walks).

Letters, often hand-delivered, were addressed as Upper James River or James River, Botetourt County. In 1837, letters sent through the mail were addressed as Clifton Forge, Botetourt County and/or Alleghany County. With the building of the Buchannan and Clifton Forge Railroad between November 16, 1876 and November 10, 1880 the train station was referenced as Wilton Depot, also for a short time during the 1880s the post office was called Carolina, named after the wife of D.S. Cook, the President of the Princess Furnace Company. By 1890 and as a result of the birth of the mining operation the area was then named Glen Wilton. Glen for the glen site it occupies and Wilton for Wilton Cook, son of D.S Cook.

In 1834, Archelius Reynolds purchased a large tract of land from Charlotte Davidson Pitzer; widow of the late Captain John Pitzer, Jr. In 1841, John Lewis Circle, Sr. also purchased land from Mrs. Pitzer. As a result, the area within a mile north and south of what would eventually be named Glen Wilton was originally owned by three families: namely, Reynolds, Circle and Wood. Archelius Reynolds died in 1863, Joseph B. Wood died in 1816, and John Lewis Circle, Sr. died in 1875.

An act approved by the General Assembly of Virginia, March 27, 1876, entitled Buchannan and Clifton Forge Railway Company to incorporate and enabled James River and Kanawha Canal Company to subscribe to the capital stock. It was proposed to construct a railway from the James River and Kanawha Canal at or near Buchannan to the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad at or near Clifton Forge. By 1884,it had become the Alleghany and Richmond Railroad, and shortly afterward, the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Company, and is now known as CSX. In May 1932, telegraph service was discontinued. Service from the four passenger/mail trains, No. 9 and No. 10 which went to and from Richmond daily and No. 32 and No. 33 which went to and from Lynchburg daily, was discontinued October 1957. Subsequently, the Glen Wilton combination station was closed and removed October 1962.

The Princess Iron Company operated in Ashland, Boyd County, Kentucky and experienced many explosions during the period of its beginnings in 1876. Company houses were built to accommodate the increasing population. Iron ore mining was the chief industry until the furnace closed in 1923, having been forced out of business by the more economical Great Lakes iron ore operations. Ore was hauled from the mines to the furnace by rail.

Between Glen Wilton and Iron Gate is the Callie Furnace which was the very first furnace erected in Botetourt County after the Civil War. It was abandoned in the early 1880s. The Princess Furnace erected in 1884 and abandoned in the 1920s. It was the only modern blast furnace in Botetourt County. In 1974, the Callie Furnace was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<START>[COREF:Q5568105|The town], at [QUANTITY|one] time, was said to have had [COREF:Q5568105|its] own school system, as indicated in [Unknown1|The Methodist Church Quarterly Conference Minutes], dated [DATETIME|January 31, 1880], and mentions an afternoon school at [Unknown2|Laurel Hill schoolhouse], which was about [QUANTITY|one] mile from the parsonage. Arranged to meet the needs of individuals on this side of the river who could not attend classes at [Unknown3|New Bethel], which was located on the other side [Unknown4|David Wood] was [Q7643464|superintendent] of [Unknown2|Laurel Hill]. In [DATETIME|1888], [Unknown5|Joseph E, Circle] sold land to [Unknown6|Fincastle District School Board] and was the site for the school attended by [Q817393|black] [Q48282|students]. In [DATETIME|1902], [Unknown7|W.E. Circle], [Q654437|executor] for the estate of [Unknown8|John L. Circle, Jr.]also sold land to the [Unknown6|Fincastle District School Board], where a frame school building was erected and was attended by [Q235155|white] [Q48282|students]. This building was closed in [DATETIME|1919] and a brick school building was constructed for grades up to the [QUANTITY|tenth] grade, however no school was held in the [Q1314|fall] of [DATETIME|1919], due to the construction being not yet completed. The new school opened in [DATETIME|January 1920]. Anyone seeking to receive a diploma had to leave the area to do so. Public transportation was not provided until the [DATETIME|1930]-[DATETIME|31] school year for those going to [Q5325242|Eagle Rock] for their final year of high school. From [DATETIME|March 1941] until [DATETIME|September 1943] the [Unknown9|Glen Wilton school] was closed due to [COREF:Unknown6|the School Board] selling the property to [Unknown10|Triton Chemical Company]. After a legal battle, [COREF:Unknown9|the school] was then reopened in [DATETIME|September 1943] for the [QUANTITY|first] [QUANTITY|three] grades and [COREF:Unknown9|it] remained open, for a short time, for the lower grades only, up to the [QUANTITY|fifth] grade. In [Q1312|Spring] of [DATETIME|1959], the [Unknown9|Glen Wilton School] was closed for good. By [Q1314|Fall] of [DATETIME|1959], all [Q16003605|elementary students] were attending [Unknown10|Eagle Rock Elementary] and all [Q15360275|high school students] were then bused approximately [QUANTITY|26] miles down [Q2507691|Route 43] to [Q6142157|James River High School], later an Intermediate Middle School was erected and those [Q48282|students] attended [Unknown11|Botetourt Intermediate School] in [Q527127|Fincastle], today [COREF:Unknown11|that school] is known as [Unknown11|William Clark Middle School].

In [DATETIME|1940], in an private effort to entice the [Unknown10|Triton Chemical Company] to build the [Q170167|TNT] plant in [Q5568105|Glen Wilton], the [Q495132|Botetourt County] sold the [Unknown9|Glen Wilton School] property (assessed for $[QUANTITY|22,000]) for $[QUANTITY|5.00] and agreed to close [COREF:Unknown9|the school] and the more than [QUANTITY|70] [Q48282|students] to [Q5325242|Eagle Rock]. [Unknown10|Triton] was to take possession of the school building and the [QUANTITY|1.6] acres of property by [DATETIME|April 1, 1941]. However, when the community learned of this proposal, school patrons, parents and taxpayers protested. When [Q48282|students] arrived at [COREF:Unknown9|the school] on [DATETIME|Tuesday, March 18, 1941], they found [COREF:Unknown9|the school] closed and a bus waiting to transport them over the very dangerous [Unknown12|Price's Bluff Road] to the [Q5325245|Eagle Rock School]. Upon parents outrage and protest, not a single child climbed aboard the bus. On [DATETIME|March 19, 1941], a delegation from [Q5568105|Glen Wilton], along with their [Q40348|attorney], met with the board of [Q1240788|supervisors] in a session to further protest the proposed closing on [DATETIME|April 1] of the [Unknown9|Glen Wilton School] and to request a resolution for proper school facilities to be provided by the time school opened in [DATETIME|September]. The board refused, leaving the delegation with the conclusion that [COREF:Q495132|the county] was more interested in procuring industry and profit rather than the needs of the [Q5568105|Glen Wilton] school children and the community. In [DATETIME|April 1941], school patrons and concerned taxpayers from [Q5568105|Glen Wilton] presented a petition to the county court claiming that the conveyance of the property by [COREF:Unknown6|the school board] was illegal. By [DATETIME|September 1941] [COREF:Unknown6|the school board] and the board of [Q1240788|supervisors] could not agree on what action to take regarding a provision in the deed to [Unknown10|Triton] in which [QUANTITY|400] men were to be employed by [DATETIME|September 1, 1941]. Stipulation in the deed provided the property be reconveyed to [COREF:Q495132|the county] by [DATETIME|December 1, 1941], if conditions were not met, and they had not been met. [COREF:Unknown6|The school board] passed a resolution and unanimously and agreed that no action was to be taken until [DATETIME|December 1], unless the suit was settled before then. The board of [Q1240788|supervisors] passed a resolution they did not approve of the delayed action of [COREF:Unknown6|the school board] and went on record as supporting construction of the new school building at or near [Q5568105|Glen Wilton]. On [DATETIME|September 27, 1941], [Unknown13|[Q16533|Judge] [Unknown13|Earl L. Abbott]] of [Unknown14|Botetourt County Circuit Court] ruled that school boards in [Q1370|Virginia] have no right to give away school property and ordered trial of the case. [Unknown10|Triton Chemical Company] admitted to [COREF:Unknown6|the school board] that [COREF:Unknown10|they] were unable to meet the conditions of the deed with respect to total employment by [DATETIME|September 1] and expressed a willingness to convey the property back to [COREF:Unknown6|the school board]. [Unknown13|[Q16533|Judge] [Unknown13|Abbott]] expressed concern over the restoration of the property and its proximity to the [Q170167|TNT] plant. On [DATETIME|November 5, 1941], after having [QUANTITY|two] rejected proposals over the settling of the school controversy out of court, school patrons agreed to accept a proposal to build a school for [Q5568105|Glen Wilton] at a cost of $[QUANTITY|8,500] to replace the one that was deeded to [Unknown10|Triton Chemical Company]. The School Board would receive $[QUANTITY|6,000] from [Unknown10|Triton Chemical Company] for the property originally deeded to [COREF:Unknown10|them] for $[QUANTITY|5.00] and the Board of [Q1240788|Supervisors] would raise the additional $[QUANTITY|2,500].

Due to the devastating explosion at the nearby plant on [DATETIME|July 20, 1942], the new school was never built. Eventually,the plant was closed. After much encouragement from the patrons, the school reopened in [DATETIME|September 1943] with [Unknown15|Ella Smith Peck] as the [Q37226|teacher] and only accommodated grades [QUANTITY|one] through [QUANTITY|three] for [DATETIME|that year]. The bus still transported the upper grades over [Unknown12|Price's Bluff Road]; the bus route was eventually changed in [DATETIME|September 1947].<END>

In 1888, Joseph E. Circle sold land to the Fincastle District School Board for an elementary school for black students, from the late 1890s until 1941. The only known name for the school was the Glen Wilton Colored Elementary School and was located behind the Mount Bethel Baptist Church. It was a one-room school with a pot-bellied stove, heated by coal. Only one teacher taught all grades which only went up to the seventh grade. This teacher would come in early to start the fire and have the room heated by the time that the children arrived. School started with prayer, a song and pledge of allegiance to the flag. The black students never had the privilege of sitting at a new desk or using chalk from a new box of chalk. Everything was second hand and used formerly by the students of the white schools. The desks had some of the former students' names carved in the wood. There was no clock so the teacher and students would listen for the bell from the white school to know when school was dismissed. At the end of the day, students helped the teacher with the cleaning of the building. From the early 1920s to 1936 students went only up to the seventh grade. Some would repeat the seventh grade, not for reasons of failing, but as to continue some form of education. From 1936 until academic year 1940–41, the school served only the first four grades while students in grades five through seven attended the Eagle Rock Colored Elementary School, and high school students grades eight through eleven attended the Botetourt County Colored High School located in Fincastle. The black students had to walk to the far end of the Glen Wilton bridge to catch the bus.
