Now he is under interrogation about the goals of his filming,\" said an adviser to the prime minister, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media. \"He was arrested by Iraqi forces.\"\nThe video contained audio of witnesses telling Saddam to \"Go to hell\" and of the former leader responding to taunts that his tormentors were being unmanly. It surfaced on Al-Jazeera television and the Internet late Saturday, the day Saddam was hanged.\nThe Associated Press quoted an unidentified adviser to Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki as saying the man arrested was \"an official who supervised the execution.\"\nAl-Maliki announced Tuesday that he had ordered an investigation into the conduct of the execution team, who could be heard taunting Saddam in the moments before his hanging.\nA U.S. military spokesman, meanwhile, said the United States would have handled the execution differently had it been in charge.\n'I did not see him taking pictures'\nOn Wednesday, an Iraqi prosecutor who was also present at the execution denied a report that he had accused national security adviser al-Rubaie of possible responsibility for the leaked video.\n\"I am not accusing Mowaffak al-Rubaie, and I did not see him taking pictures,\" Munqith al-Faroon, a prosecutor in the case that sent Saddam to the gallows, told The Associated Press.\n\"But I saw two of the government officials who were ... present during the execution taking all the video of the execution, using the lights that were there for the official taping of the execution. They used mobile phone cameras. I do not know their names, but I would remember their faces,\" al-Faroon said in a telephone interview.\nThe prosecutor said the two officials were openly taking video pictures, which are believed to be those which appeared on Al-Jazeera satellite and a Web site within hours of Saddam's execution.\nThe New York Times on Wednesday reported that al-Faroon told the newspaper \"one of two men he had seen holding a cell phone camera aloft to make a video of Mr. Hussein's last moments up to and past the point where he fell through the trapdoor was Mowaffak al-Rubaie, Mr. Maliki's national security adviser.\"\nThe Times said it had been unable to reach al-Rubaie for comment. AP also could not reach him Wednesday. His secretary said the security adviser, a close aide to al-Maliki, was in Najaf and would not return until later.\nChants of 'Muqtada'\nAl-Faroon said there were 14 Iraqi officials, including himself and another prosecutor, as well as three hangmen present for the execution. All the officials, he said, were flown by U.S. helicopter to the former military intelligence facility where Saddam was put to death in an execution chamber used by his own security men for years.\nThe prosecutor said he believed all mobile phones had been confiscated before the flight and that some of the officials' bodyguards, who arrived by car, had smuggled the camera phones to the two officials he had seen taking the video pictures.\nAl-Arabiya television reported that the person under arrest is one of the guards who was a member of the execution team, according to an MSNBC translator. There was no further information about whether the person under arrest was a guard or other official.\nSome of the last words Saddam heard, according to the leaked cell phone video, were a chant of \"Muqtada, Muqtada, Muqtada,\" a reference to Muqtada al-Sadr, the radical anti-American Shiite cleric, whose Mahdi Army militia is believed responsible for many killings that have targeted Sunnis and driven many from their homes.\nAl-Sadr's father was killed by Saddam. The militant cleric is a key al-Maliki backer.\nU.S. response\nMaj. Gen. William Caldwell, a U.S. military spokesman, told reporters Wednesday that the execution would have been handled differently had U.S. forces been in charge.\n\"If you are asking me: 'Would we have done things differently?' Yes, we would have. But that's not our decision. That's the government of Iraq's decision,\" Caldwell said.\nHe added that Saddam was \"dignified\" and \"courteous\" as he was transferred from US military control to Iraqi custody before he was executed.\n\"He spoke very well to our military police, as he always had, and when getting off at the prison site he said farewell to his interpreter; he thanked the military police squad,\" Caldwell said.\n", "evaluation_span": [0, 5012], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [0, 9], "entity_id": "Q57673", "name": "Nouri al-Maliki", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 1, "span": [76, 83], "entity_id": "Q1530",

{"id": 1, "title": "16384904", "text": "Resolution to imbibe less goes awry \u2014 already\nMyriad of conflicting medical studies are enough to drive this writer to drink\nThe fruitcake's been digested, the gift cards are empty, and now it's time to face the most grueling holiday task of all: the annual reassessment. Do I need to exercise more? Spend less? Set aside more quality time for friends and family? The resolution list goes on and on \u2014 much like that interminable karaoke version of \"Santa Baby\" at this year's holiday party.\nUnfortunately, since I was the one holding the microphone, this year's resolution seems painfully clear: Cut back on the alcohol intake.\nNot that I drink a lot \u2014 usually just a glass of wine with dinner, if that but I've read that even one drink a day can adversely affect my health.\nAlso, a recent study by the Mayo Clinic found that women's bodies are less adept at breaking down alcohol than men's. As a result, the more we drink, the more we risk heart disease, cancer, cirrhosis of the liver, and, perhaps the most chilling side effect of all \u2014 kissing our skinny jeans goodbye forever.\nBut how much alcohol is too much? There's the rub. The answer seems to depend on which study you read. The Mayo Clinic study says one drink a day is OK for \"younger women who aren't planning a pregnancy\" and that \"postmenopausal women should limit themselves to less.\" But what about those of us who don't fit in either category?\nLooking for a definitive answer, I turned to another study, this one conducted by a group of doctors at Stony Brook University in New York. But their finding that drinking three glasses of red wine a week reduces the risk of colorectal cancer only confused matters further.\nWho to believe?\nShould I cut back on alcohol entirely in order to fend off heart disease, liver problems and dreaded weight gain (not to mention potential blackmail opportunities by family, friends and co-workers) or suck down three or more glasses a week to keep the colorectal cancer at bay?\nOr should I listen to the doctors the Goteborg University in Sweden, who found that mice that had ingested low levels of alcohol on a daily basis showed a significantly lower risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis than mice that just drank water. Obsessed, I started digging through medical journals and online health stories until the studies began to stack up like swizzle sticks at a company-hosted bar.\nIn London, researchers found that people who drank alcohol have a lower risk of developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but the risk of cancer of the mouth, esophagus and liver actually increases.\nAt Ohio State University, a study showed that drinking moderately (such as a couple of drinks a day) improved the memories of laboratory rats, although a study at the University of Missouri declared that alcohol hindered academic success.\nLive longer so you can die young\nAdding it all up, it seems that by drinking alcohol I can both reduce my chances of heart disease and increase my risk for high blood pressure, fend off dementia while upping my chances for brain damage, boost my memory at the same time that I become more stupid, avoid lymphoma while veering towards breast and liver cancer, and in general, both live longer and die younger.\nIn other words, alcohol is every bit the hazy hypocritical demon it's always been (especially when there's a microphone involved). So this year, I'm taking another resolution route altogether. Instead of squelching my alcohol intake, I'm going to cut out karaoke \u2014 and perhaps limit my medical studies to just one per day with dinner, if that.\nDiane Mapes is a Seattle freelance writer and author of the recently released \"How to Date in a Post-Dating World.\"\n", "evaluation_span": [0, 3689], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [449, 459], "entity_id": "Q955029", "name": "Santa Baby", "type": "Q17537576"}, {"id": 1, "span": [803, 814], "entity_id": "Q1130172", "name": "Mayo Clinic", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 2, "span": [1190, 1201], "entity_id": "Q1130172", "name": "Mayo Clinic", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 3, "span": [1517, 1539], "entity_id": "Q969850", "name": "Stony Brook University", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 4, "span": [1543, 1551], "entity_id": "Q60", "name": "New York City", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 5, "span": [2019, 2038], "entity_id": "Q371522", "name": "University of Gothenburg", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 6, "span": [2042, 2048], "entity_id": "Q34", "name": "Sweden", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 7, "span": [2392, 2398], "entity_id": "Q84", "name": "London", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 8, "span": [2484, 2502], "entity_id": "Q209369", "name": "Hodgkin lymphoma", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 9, "span": [2584, 2605], "entity_id": "Q309331", "name": "Ohio State University", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 10, "span": [2748, 2770], "entity_id": "Q579968", "name": "University of Missouri", "type": "Q43229"}]}
{"id": 2, "title": "16417540", "text": "TUSCALOOSA, Ala. - Nick Saban couldn't escape his college roots, so he quit trying.\nSaban was introduced as Alabama's coach on Thursday, touting his championship aspirations and citing his love of college football as a reason for taking a pay cut to leave the Miami Dolphins.\nIn other words, he said the things Crimson Tide fans most wanted to hear.\n\"My heart's here. I love it here,\" he said. \"I like to affect people, and that's why I'm here. This is obviously one of the best places in the country to have an opportunity to do that.\"\nTaking over a program with a rich tradition led by the late coach Bear Bryant, who won five national titles, Saban refused to dwell in the past.\n\"It's what you do now,\" he said.\nHis resume features the one thing Alabama fans hunger for most: A national title. His \"championship credentials\" \u2014 as athletic director Mal Moore put it \u2014 are why the Tide was willing to offer a reported eight-year deal worth an estimated $32 million plus incentives, the richest in college football.\n\"I know there's tremendous expectations here,\" Saban said. \"I can tell you that, however you feel about it, I have even higher expectations for what we want to accomplish. I want to win every game we play.\"\nSaban led Alabama divisional rival LSU to a national title in 2003 and two SEC championships before heading to Miami.\nAlabama hasn't won the league or even the Western Division since 1999 under Mike DuBose. The Tide's latest national title \u2014 its sixth \u2014 came in 1992 under Gene Stallings. Alabama has had four losing seasons since '97.\n\"His teams always play with confidence and pride and I know that in order to win a national championship, a team has to be mentally as well as physically tough,\" said Moore, who played and coached under Bryant. \"Coach Saban's teams have always possessed those qualities.\"\nAs for the big salary, Moore said, \"I just think it was a very crucial hire for us in this time in our history.\"\nNot everyone in Alabama was convinced.\n\"That certainly makes a strong statement in a state that funds education at one of the lowest per-pupil rates of any state in the country,\" said state Rep. Richard Lindsey, D-Centre, chairman of a House committee that writes the education budget. \"I think we've let it get out of hand.\"\nBut the school's faculty senate president, chemistry professor John Vincent, had a more positive view.\n\"The money doesn't come out of the academic side of the university. The academic side is self sufficient,\" he said. \"Of course I would like to see these kinds of benefits available on the academic side, but this hiring offers much to the university.\"\nVincent said having a high-profile coach like Saban would create more interest in the University of Alabama, which would bring more interest and money to the academic side.\nSaban said his first goals were to hire a coaching staff and work on completing the Tide's recruiting class. He has already hired Florida State assistant Kevin Steele to be his defensive coordinator, according to Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden.\nSaban's success attracting top prep players is evident. Quarterback JaMarcus Russell, receiver Early Doucet and safety LaRon Landry \u2014 who all played key roles in LSU's 41-14 Sugar Bowl victory over Notre Dame on Wednesday night \u2014 were among players he brought to Baton Rouge.\nSaban's wife, Terry, encouraged the move to Tuscaloosa and another college job.\n\"It's the relationships, that family feeling, that we missed,\" she said.\nAnd the warm reception on Wednesday afternoon didn't hurt, either. Saban said when he arrived at LSU from Michigan State as a less well-known coach, it was just him, an equipment manager and his agent.\nNot this time.\n\"When the plane landed, we were overwhelmed that there was this huge crowd of people just cheering, like your mother's saying, 'Come on home,\"' Terry Saban said.\nThe well-traveled Saban also said he intends for this to be his final coaching stop before retiring to Lake Burton in north Georgia, where he has a home.\n\"That's where I like it, and that's my next stop,\" the 55-year-old Saban said.\n", "evaluation_span": [0, 4081], "labels":

Have you broken it already? Don't despair. Nutritionist Joy Bauer has created 5 healthy, and simple, resolutions we all should have on our \"to do\" list for the new year:\nJoy's Healthy Resolutions for 2007:\n1. Make YOURSELF a priority\n*Shop for healthy foods your body needs\n*Get enough sleep\n*Exercise regularly\n2. Know your numbers\nRing in the New Year with a pledge to visit your doctor and learn your blood pressure reading and fasting cholesterol, triglyceride and blood sugar levels.\u00a0 The sooner you know where you stand, the sooner you can take action to make corrections.\n*\u00a0\u00a0Optimal blood pressure equal to or < 120 / 80 mmHg\n*\u00a0 Total cholesterol\u00a0 < 200 mg/dL\n*\u00a0 LDL-Cholesterol\u00a0 < 100 mg/dL\n*\u00a0 HDL-Cholesterol\u00a0 40 mg/dL or higher\n*\u00a0 Cholesterol ratio\u00a0 below 5\n*\u00a0\u00a0Triglycerides\u00a0 < 150 mg/dL\n*\u00a0\u00a0Blood Sugars\u00a0 < 100 mg/dL\n3. Up your ante!\nAntioxidants are naturally occurring compounds found in plant based foods. Antioxidants help the body fight many serious conditions, including cancer and heart disease, by thwarting the action of harmful free radicals. According to a study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, July 2006, the following foods are among the richest in antioxidants. Go out of your way to incorporate them into your daily diet.\n1. Blackberries\n2. Walnuts\n3. Strawberries\n4. Artichokes\u00a0\n5. Cranberries\n6. Raspberries\n7. Blueberries\n8. Cloves, ground\n4. Incorporate whole grains\n2007 is the year to stop buying refined, white starch. Instead, embrace brown rice, whole wheat pasta, whole grain bread and other healthy grain varieties like millet, faro, and amaranth.\nLearn how to buy the right bread! Many consumers believe they're buying the right type of bread but are often confused. According to a Sara Lee Food & Beverage survey, 73% of consumers who were asked what type of bread they had in the house said \"whole wheat bread,\" but after checking the label realized that they mistakenly thought \"enriched wheat\" meant whole grain.\nLook a \"whole\" lot closer at labels in the bread aisle - it must say 100% Whole Wheat or 100% Whole Grain, or list the word WHOLE as one of the first ingredients on the label.\n5.\u00a0Slow the pace - lose fat on your waist\nIn an interesting experiment that was presented at the 2006 Annual Scientific Meeting a NAASO, women were invited to eat a pasta lunch on two different days. On one day, the women were given a small spoon and asked to take small bites, put the spoon down between bites, and chew each bite at least 15 times. On the second day, the women were given a large spoon and asked to eat as quickly as possible without stopping between bites. On both occasions, the women ate until they felt comfortably full. When researchers measured how many calories the women ate, they found that women ate 67 more calories when they ate quickly than when they ate slowly. Although this may not sound like much, calories add up.\nAn additional 134 calories per day, means 48,910 calories per year\u2026. that's potentially 14 pounds (lost or gained!).\nFor more information on healthy eating, visit nutrition expert, Joy Bauer's website at www.joybauernutrition.com\n", "evaluation_span": [0, 3278], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [54, 63], "entity_id": "Q6297036", "name": "Joy Bauer", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 1, "span": [116, 137], "entity_id": "Q2155091", "name": "New Year's resolution", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 2, "span": [186, 198], "entity_id": "Q2576499", "name": "nutritionist", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871"}, {"id": 3, "span": [199, 208], "entity_id": "Q6297036", "name": "Joy Bauer", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 4, "span": [313, 316], "entity_id": "Q6297036", "name": "Joy Bauer", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 5, "span": [488, 496], "entity_id": "Q34812", "name": "New Year", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 6, "span": [813, 828], "entity_id": "Q28749", "name": "low-density lipoprotein", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 7, "span": [845, 860], "entity_id": "Q410020", "name": "high-density lipoprotein", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 8, "span": [914, 927], "entity_id": "Q186319", "name": "triglyceride", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 9, "span": [944, 956], "entity_id": "Q275157", "name": "blood glucose", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 10, "span": [1244, 1282], "entity_id": "Q7713500", "name": "American Journal of Clinical Nutrition", "type": "Q17537576|Q2424752"}, {"id": 11, "span": [1418, 1430], "entity_id": "Q19842373", "name": "blackberry", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 12, "span": [1434, 1441], "entity_id": "Q208021", "name": "walnut", "type": "Q2424752"}, {"id": 13, "span": [1445, 1457], "entity_id": "Q13158", "name": "strawberry", "type": "Q16521"}, {"id": 14, "span": [1461, 1471], "entity_id": "Q23041430", "name": "globe artichoke", "type": "Q16521"}, {"id": 15, "span": [1476, 1487], "entity_id": "Q13181", "name": "cranberry", "type": "Q16521"}, {"id": 16, "span": [1491, 1502], "entity_id": "Q13179", "name": "raspberry", "type": "Q2424752|Q483394"}, {"id": 17, "span": [1506, 1517], "entity_id": "Q13178", "name": "Vaccinium sect.

Va.\nAs it turned out, 12 of the 13 miners never made it out alive.\nIn West Virginia Tuesday, Randal McCloy, the lone survivor of the disaster, joined the families of the 12 men who died \u2014 to remember them and the nightmare that began one year ago.\n\"I'm just sick when I think \u2014 every day when I think how those men had to die and it makes me sick,\" says Debbie Hamner whose husband died in the mine.\nSince Sago, both West Virginia and the federal government have passed new mine safety laws.

{"id": 5, "title": "16443053", "text": "Chertoff pledges to address communications\nHomeland security secretary acknowledges friction has hindered progress\nWASHINGTON - The nation's homeland security chief pledged Wednesday that 75 metropolitan areas would have advanced disaster communications systems by 2009 but acknowledged that friction among emergency agencies continues to hinder progress.\n\"We are determined to get this job done in the next two years,\" Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said at a news briefing.\nHe did not say how much the effort would cost, but so far the government has distributed more than $2.9 billion to communities around the country with mixed results. Democrats who will control Congress this year have also promised to make communications upgrades a priority, but have provided little detail.\nChertoff released a survey of how well the 75 U.S. communities have prepared their first responders to communicate during a catastrophe. More than five years after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, exposed severe weaknesses in the ability of emergency workers to communicate with each other, the report gave only six of the areas studied the highest grades.\nPortions of the report had been obtained Tuesday by The Associated Press.\n'Longstanding cultural differences' Chertoff said Wednesday that since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, agencies have tried to overcome old turf rivalries that can hamper emergency work.\n\"In some communities, not all, there are some longstanding cultural differences between different kinds of responders,\" including police, firefighters and medical personnel, Chertoff said. \"I think that is a challenge and that culture has been a challenge.\"\nThe report found that while emergency agencies in more than 60 percent of the communities studied had the ability to talk to each other during a crisis, only 21 percent overall showed \"the seamless use\" of equipment needed to also communicate with state and federal officials.\nThe report's highest ratings went to the Washington, D.C., area; San Diego; Minneapolis-St. Paul; Columbus, Ohio; Sioux Falls, S.D.; and Laramie County, Wyo.\nThe lowest scores went to Chicago; Cleveland; Baton Rouge, La.; Mandan, N.D.; and American Samoa. The report includes large and small cities and their suburbs, along with U.S. territories.\nIn an overview, the report says all 75 areas surveyed have policies in place for helping their emergency workers communicate. But it also finds that \"formalized governance (leadership and planning) across regions has lagged.\"\nThe study is likely to add fuel to what looms as a battle in Congress this year. Democrats who take over the majority this week have promised to try fixing the problem emergency agencies have communicating with each other but have not said specifically what they will do, how much it will cost or how they will pay for it.\n\"Five years after 9/11, we continue to turn a deaf ear to gaps in interoperable communications,\" \u2014 the term used for emergency agencies' abilities to talk to each other, said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. \"If it didn't have such potentially devastating consequences, it would be laughable.\"\nThe attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, revealed major problems in how well emergency agencies were able to talk to each other during a catastrophe. Many firefighters climbing the World Trade Center towers died when they were unable to hear police radio warnings to leave the crumbling buildings.\nThe report says first responders in New York now have well-established systems to communicate with each other \u2014 but not the best, most advanced possible. Thirteen U.S. cities score better than New York.\nJudged in three categories\nCommunities were judged in three categories: operating procedures in place, use of communications systems and how effectively local governments have coordinated in preparation for a disaster.\nMost of the areas surveyed included cities and their surrounding communities, based on the assumption that in a major crisis emergency personnel from all local jurisdictions would respond.\nThe areas with the six best scores were judged advanced in all three categories. The cities with the lowest grades had reached the early implementation stage for only one category, and intermediate grades in the other two categories.\nThe Chicago Office of Emergency Management and Communications took issue with the report's methodology and findings.\n\"We strongly disagree with the results of this study, and feel that the parameters of the study were inconsistent and limited,\" the statement said.\nTammy Lapp, the emergency coordinator for Mandan and Morton County, N.D., said she was not surprised by their low ranking on the scorecard.\n\"We knew with our limited funds, we were going to fall short,\" she said.\n", "evaluation_span": [0, 4745], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [0, 8], "entity_id": "Q733612", "name": "Michael Chertoff", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 1, "span":

{"id": 8, "title": "16444287", "text": "Muslim with U.S. family is held, turned away\nAuthorities detain businessman of Syrian descent for four days in Las Vegas\nFRESNO, Calif. - A German businessman of Syrian descent who wanted to surprise his daughter with a holiday visit was detained for four days in a Las Vegas holding cell before being sent back home without explanation.\nA civil rights group called the U.S. authorities' treatment of Majed Shehadeh a case of anti-Muslim discrimination.\nShehadeh, 62, flew from Frankfurt to Las Vegas last Thursday, hoping to meet with his wife and drive to Bakersfield, California, where his American-born daughter had just gotten news she had passed the California bar exam. Instead, he wound up shivering in a holding cell without ever being told why he couldn't enter the country, he said.\nRoxanne Hercules, a spokeswoman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, confirmed Tuesday that Shehadeh was denied entry, but would not discuss specifics of his case. She said Shehadeh's visa waiver could have been denied because \"he could have a criminal record, or it could be a terrorism issue.\"\nThe detention follows a series of similar incidents involving Muslim passengers, according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations.\nIn October, an Islamic scholar from South Africa was denied entry at San Francisco International Airport. A month later, six imams were taken off a US Airways flight from Minneapolis to Phoenix after a passenger reported overhearing them criticize the U.S. war in Iraq.\n\"Overall these cases send a message that Muslims are second-class citizens who can be detained and kept from their families,\" said Affad Shaikh, a civil rights coordinator for CAIR.\n'Nobody ever informed me why'\nShehadeh touched down Thursday afternoon on a direct Condor Airlines flight to McCarran International Airport, where his American wife was waiting to pick him up. The couple had planned to visit family in the Las Vegas area, before surprising their daughter for the New Year and celebrating her wedding anniversary in Central California.\n\"I gave them my German passport, and he looked to see which countries I visited. He found I had stamps that looked like Arabic and asked if they were fake,\" Shehadeh said Tuesday in a phone interview from his home in Alzenau, a small Bavarian village.\n\"Nobody ever informed me why I was being questioned,\" he said. \"All that was ever told to me was this had to do with Washington.\"\nAfter being interrogated by Border Protection and FBI agents for more than 12 hours at the airport, Shehadeh said he was handcuffed and transported in the back of police car to a North Las Vegas jail. Officials told family members they had denied Shehadeh's visa waiver, which grants German citizens the right to enter the U.S. with no additional paperwork, said his wife Joanne Mulligan.\nOfficials with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said they could not comment on why he was denied entry. FBI and airport officials in Las Vegas also declined comment.\n'Never even had a speeding ticket'\nAn aide to Sen. Dianne Feinstein later told the family that Shehadeh was on a \"look-out list,\" Mulligan said. Feinstein's office confirmed Tuesday that the family contacted her, but wouldn't comment further.\n\"I said you've got to be joking me, he's never even had a speeding ticket,\" said Mulligan, a retired math teacher for the U.S. military. \"I mean, we're Muslims, and we travel a lot. Maybe the countries we travel to are not the countries they want you to visit.\"\nOnce in the holding facility, Shehadeh said he was stripped of his shoes, jacket and prescribed heart medicine and locked in a cell with about 25 other detainees. There was one toilet in the middle of the room, and access to a telephone was extremely limited, he said.\nOn Sunday, he was released and sent back to Frankfurt on the same charter airline.\nShehadeh's daughter Majida Shehadeh said she was glad her father made it home, but feared he wouldn't be able to return to visit.\n\"I used to be happy I moved here,\" she said. \"But now I can't wait for when I leave here. The mentality is not what it was like beforehand.\"\n", "evaluation_span": [0, 4123], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [0, 6], "entity_id": "Q47740", "name": "Muslim", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 1, "span":

{"id": 9, "title": "16447201", "text": "Hindus throng to Ganges for bathing festival\nPilgrims believe dip in river during six week celebration will cleanse sin\nALLAHABAD, India - Nearly half a million Hindus braved near-freezing temperatures to wash away their sins in the icy waters of the Ganges river in northern India on Wednesday, the first day of a six-week festival.\nAs many as 70 million people from India and abroad are expected over the whole \"Ardh Kumbh Mela\" or Half Pitcher Festival, billed as one of the largest gatherings on earth.\nMen, women, children, holy men in saffron and the infirm gathered at the confluence of the Ganges, the Yamuna and a mythical third river in Allahabad city well before dawn, waiting for the sun to rise for the auspicious bath on the first day of the 42-day event.\nThey chanted verses from Hindu scriptures and sang holy songs as they walked towards the bathing areas, some lying prostrate after every few steps to salute the gods.\nThe festival falls midway between the \"Maha Kumbh Mela\" or the Great Pitcher Festival, celebrated once every 12 years.\nHindus believe that bathing in the Ganges during the festivals cleanses them of sin, speeding the way to the attainment of nirvana or the afterlife.\n'Like being with God'\nAfter dipping in the polluted but sacred waters, many filled cans, bottles and steel containers for relatives and friends who could not make it. Others sprinkled it on their dry clothes.\n\"It was a long-cherished desire to take a dip here during the Kumbh Mela,\" said Naba Kumar Ghosh, a young school teacher from the eastern Indian state of West Bengal. \"The experience has been one of fulfillment, a complete cleansing of the inner self.\"\nShakuntala, a 70-year-old woman who gave only one name, said she traveled all night from the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh to bathe in the Ganges, just as she has done at every Kumbh Mela over the last 25 years.\n\"It was a divine experience, a dip in the holy waters is like being with God,\" she said. \"God willing, I will be here for the next 'Kumbh' too\".\nRama Devi, an old woman from Allahabad who could not remember her age, has not missed a single Kumbh and was determined to make it this time despite her inability to walk.\nWith roads closed to traffic, her 35-year-old son, a soldier in the Indian army, carried her on his back for the 6-mile walk from their house to the waters.\nTight security\nAllahabad, in the Hindi heartland state of Uttar Pradesh, is one of four spots where Garuda, the winged steed of Hindu god Vishnu, is said to have rested during a titanic battle with demons over a pitcher of divine nectar of immortality.\nGaruda's flight lasted 12 divine days, or 12 years of mortal time, hence the celebration of \"Maha Kumbh Mela\" every 12 years.\nThe midway point between two such celebrations is also considered highly favorable because the position of the sun and the moon are the same as during the \"Maha Kumbh\".\nThe \"Maha Kumbh Mela\" in 1989 attracted 15 million pilgrims and the Guinness Book of Records dubbed it the largest gathering of human beings for a single purpose. The festival in 2001 drew between 50 and 70 million.\nThousands of tents and camps have been built to house pilgrims across the 4,000 acre\u00a0 festival area and more than 10,000 policemen, including specially-trained \"terrorist spotters\", have been deployed, authorities said.\n", "evaluation_span": [0, 3346], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [0, 6], "entity_id": "Q10090", "name": "Hindu", "type": "Q33829|Q4392985"}, {"id": 1, "span": [17, 23], "entity_id": "Q5089", "name": "Ganges", "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 2, "span": [45, 53], "entity_id": "Q542704", "name": "pilgrim", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 3, "span": [120, 129], "entity_id": "Q162442", "name": "Prayagraj", "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 4, "span": [131, 136], "entity_id": "Q668", "name": "India", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 5, "span": [161, 167], "entity_id": "Q10090", "name": "Hindu", "type": "Q33829|Q4392985"}, {"id": 6, "span": [251, 263], "entity_id": "Q5089", "name": "Ganges", "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 7, "span": [267, 281], "entity_id": "Q1058785", "name": "North India", "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 8, "span": [368, 373], "entity_id": "Q668", "name": "India", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 9, "span": [414, 429], "entity_id": "Q10283", "name": "Kumbh Mela", "type": "Q1656682"}, {"id": 10, "span": [434, 455], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 11, "span": [598, 604], "entity_id": "Q5089", "name": "Ganges", "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 12, "span": [610, 616], "entity_id": "Q132726", "name": "Yamuna", "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 13, "span": [647, 656], "entity_id": "Q162442", "name": "Prayagraj", "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 14, "span": [795, 811], "entity_id": "Q1194040", "name": "Hindu scriptures and texts", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 15, "span": [976, 991], "entity_id": "Q10283", "name": "Kumbh Mela", "type": "Q1656682"}, {"id": 16, "span": [1000, 1022], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 17, "span": [1091, 1097], "entity_id": "Q5089", "name": "Ganges", "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 18, "span": [1476, 1486], "entity_id": "Q10283", "name": "Kumbh Mela", "type": "Q1656682"}, {"id": 19, "span": [1494, 1510], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 20, "span": [1568, 1579], "entity_id": "Q1356", "name": "West Bengal", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 21, "span": [1784, 1798], "entity_id": "Q1188", "name": "Madhya Pradesh", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 22, "span": [1815, 1821], "entity_id": "Q5089", "name": "Ganges", "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 23, "span": [1853, 1863], "entity_id": "Q10283", "name": "Kumbh Mela", "type": "Q1656682"}, {"id": 24, "span": [2020, 2025], "entity_id": "Q10283", "name": "Kumbh Mela", "type": "Q1656682"}, {"id": 25, "span": [2033, 2042], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 26, "span": [2062, 2071], "entity_id": "Q162442", "name": "Prayagraj", "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 27, "span": [2128, 2133], "entity_id": "Q10283", "name": "Kumbh Mela", "type": "Q1656682"}, {"id": 28, "span": [2273, 2284], "entity_id": "Q355771", "name": "Indian Army", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 29, "span": [2377, 2386], "entity_id": "Q162442", "name": "Prayagraj", "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 30, "span": [2395, 2400], "entity_id": "Q1568", "name": "Hindi", "type": "Q17376908"}, {"id": 31, "span": [2420, 2433], "entity_id": "Q1498", "name": "Uttar Pradesh", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 32, "span": [2462, 2468], "entity_id": "Q188676", "name": "Garuda", "type": "Q21070598|Q729"}, {"id": 33, "span": [2490, 2499], "entity_id": "Q979507", "name": "Hindu deity", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 34, "span": [2500, 2506], "entity_id": "Q11380", "name": "Vishnu", "type": "Q21070598"}, {"id": 35, "span": [2615, 2621], "entity_id": "Q188676", "name": "Garuda", "type": "Q21070598|Q729"}, {"id": 36, "span": [2708, 2723], "entity_id": "Q10283", "name": "Kumbh Mela", "type": "Q1656682"}, {"id": 37, "span": [2897, 2907], "entity_id": "Q10283", "name": "Kumbh Mela", "type": "Q1656682"}, {"id": 38, "span": [2915, 2930], "entity_id": "Q10283", "name": "Kumbh Mela", "type": "Q1656682"}, {"id": 39, "span": [2978, 3002], "entity_id": "Q41675", "name": "Guinness World Records", "type": "Q17537576|Q2424752|Q618779"}]}

Ford was laid to rest on the grounds of his presidential museum Wednesday after eight days of mourning and remembrance that spanned the country, from the California desert to the nation's capital and back to Ford's boyhood home.\nThe sunset burial capped the official mourning for the 38th president after a 17-hour viewing Tuesday night and Wednesday at the museum in his hometown.\nAt a graveside service that included a 21-gun salute and a 21-aircraft flyover, Vice President Dick Cheney presented former first lady Betty Ford with the American flag that was draped over her husband's casket.\nEarlier, Ford was remembered as a man not afraid to laugh, make tough decisions or listen to the advice of his independent wife in eulogies delivered during a funeral at the church the couple attended for six decades.\nAn honor guard carried the casket inside Grace Episcopal Church, where Ford's defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, and Ford's successor, Jimmy Carter, recalled his public service.\nRumsfeld: 'He was one of us' His widow wiped away tears as she sat with the couple's four children and more than 300 dignitaries and family friends, including golfing legend Jack Nicklaus.\n\"He was one of us,\" Rumsfeld said, \"And that made him special and needed in a dark and dangerous hour for our nation.\"\nRumsfeld, who recently left his post as President Bush's defense secretary, remembered Ford as a courageous and steady leader who healed the nation after Watergate.\nRumsfeld said the Navy is considering naming a new aircraft carrier after Ford, a Navy veteran. A decision is expected later this month.\n\"How fitting it would be that the name Gerald R. Ford will patrol the high seas for decades to come in defense of the nation he loved so much,\" he said.\nCarter described the close personal friendship he and Ford developed over the years.\n\"I relished his sound advice,\" Carter said as his wife, Rosalynn, cried. \"I want to thank my predecessor for all he did to heal our land.\"\nThousands of flag-waving mourners lined the roads under sunny skies as the motorcade bearing Ford's casket traveled between his presidential museum in downtown Grand Rapids to the church, before returning to the museum.\nViewing period extended\nThe viewing had to be extended Wednesday until nearly noon so everyone in line could pay their respects. Some 57,000 mourners waited hours to file past the flag-draped casket during the night. Some stopped and made silent prayers.\n\"We're here to honor him,\" said Philip Bareham of Lansing, who was the last person to view the casket and whose parents were among Ford's earliest supporters and political allies. \"We just love this family. They are so down to earth.\"\nFord represented Grand Rapids in Congress for 25 years. His family had belonged  to Grace Episcopal Church since the early 1940s.\nRichard Norton Smith, an author, presidential historian and former director of Ford's museum and library, reminded mourners how important Ford's hometown was to him.\n\"Grand Rapids returned his affection many times over,\" which was \"unforgettably demonstrated by the tens of thousands who stood in line for hours outside the museum, braving the cold to assure that his last night was anything but lonely,\" Smith said.\nDraped over the back of one pew at the funeral was a blue blanket with the letter \"M\" emblazoned on it, symbolizing Ford's alma mater, the University of Michigan, where he played football for national championship teams in 1932 and 1933.\nMany of the mourners at the museum and lining the roads during his funeral procession on Wednesday wore Michigan hats and sweat shirts in his honor.\nFord, who became president after Richard Nixon resigned, died Dec. 26 at his home in Rancho Mirage, Calif.

But in the end, analysts said, the criticism over Nardelli's hefty pay and The Home Depot Inc.'s poor stock performance forced a change of heart.\nNardelli abruptly resigned as chairman and chief executive of the world's largest home improvement store chain after six years at the helm, the company said Wednesday.\nHe didn't leave empty-handed: the Atlanta-based company said Nardelli would receive a severance package worth roughly $210 million, an amount decried by some lawmakers as a golden parachute that sends the wrong message to investors.\n\"It's a sign of being totally out of touch,\" said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., the incoming chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. \"They don't understand the extent to which they make the American public angry.\"\nFrank said he would push for legislation requiring public companies to allow shareholders to have a say in compensation and severance for senior executives. At Home Depot's annual meeting last May, shareholder proposals to give investors a say on the CEO's pay and to restrict retirement benefits for senior executives were rejected.\nNardelli's severance package includes a cash payment of $20 million and the acceleration of unvested deferred stock awards currently valued at roughly $77 million. A Home Depot spokesman said the timing of the resignation, which was effective Tuesday, had no bearing on the amount in the package.\nThe total package is seven times the $30 million Home Depot set aside last June for stores and employees that provide good customer service. Home Depot has 2,127 stores and 355,000 employees in the United States, Canada, Mexico and China.\nHome Depot said Nardelli was being replaced by Frank Blake, its vice chairman, effective immediately.\nHome Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus, who had a hand in hiring Nardelli, said he supports the board's decision to replace Nardelli with Blake.\n\"My concern is what happens in the future, and I feel very good about it,\" said Marcus, who no longer works for Home Depot in any official capacity but remains one of the company's largest individual shareholders.\nAsked about the severance payout, Marcus said the amount won't be that big a deal in the long-run if the company's stock price improves.\n\"It's like the old story, if the stock goes up 10 points, who's going to care?\" Marcus said.\nNardelli, a former college football player, became CEO of Home Depot in December 2000 after being passed over for the top job at General Electric Co., where Nardelli had been a senior executive.\nBlake's appointment is permanent, Home Depot spokesman Jerry Shields said. The company declined to make Blake available for comment, and messages left for Nardelli with his secretary and on his wife's cell phone were not immediately returned.\nHome Depot shares rose 91 cents, or 2.3 percent, to close at $41.07 on the New York Stock Exchange, near the upper end of their 52-week range of $32.85 to $43.95. Before Wednesday's news, Home Depot's stock had been down more than 3 percent on a split-adjusted basis since Nardelli took over.\nNardelli's sudden departure was stunning in that he told The Associated Press as recently as Sept. 1 that he had no intention of leaving, and a key director said that the board was pleased with Nardelli despite the uproar by some investors. That director, Bonnie Hill, did not immediately return messages left Wednesday for her at her office in Los Angeles.\nAsked in the earlier AP interview if he had thought of hanging up his orange apron and leaving Home Depot, Nardelli said unequivocally that he hadn't. Asked what he thought he would be doing 10 years from now, Nardelli said, \"Selling hammers.\"\nFor The Home Depot?\n\"Absolutely,\" he said at the time.\nMarcus said he had no idea Nardelli's resignation was coming.\n\"Obviously, something happened over this last period of time that changed their mind and Nardelli's mind about staying,\" Marcus said.\nHome Depot said Nardelli's decision to resign was by mutual agreement with Home Depot.\n\"We are very grateful to Bob for his strong leadership of The Home Depot over the past six years,\" Home Depot's board said in a statement.\nNardelli was a nuts-and-bolts leader. He helped increase revenue and profits at Home Depot and increase the number of stores the company operates. Home Depot's earnings per share have increased by approximately 150 percent over the last five years. But the public discussion about his pay and the company's stock price became a distraction.\nAs of the end of 2005, Nardelli had earned $123.7 million in compensation excluding certain stock option grants since becoming CEO. His compensation for 2006 has not yet been disclosed.\nIndustry experts and analysts said his departure and Blake's ascent to the top job are a good thing for Home Depot.\n\"This is not about strategy or vision,\" said James Senn, director of Robinson College's Center for Global Business Leadership at Georgia State University. \"This is coming down to two things. Really the foundation of leadership is credibility. Bob has run into some problems there. The second is execution.\"\nEdward Jones analyst Stephanie Hoff said she views the developments at Home Depot as a sign that there was a need for change at the top, not a change in the company's strategy.\n\"I think his gruff demeanor, while some people would consider that refreshing, sometimes hurt him,\" Hoff said, adding that Blake is considered by some as more articulate and polished.\nShe added, \"I think the board basically was looking at this situation and figured Nardelli had become such a lightning rod for criticism of his pay package.\"\n", "evaluation_span": [0,

{"id": 12, "title": "16451212", "text": "Health insurance bridges gap for poor families\nFree medical care can help children get out of poverty, official says\nBIRMINGHAM, Ala. - For years, Al Rohling watched parents quit their jobs when their kids got sick, deliberately making their incomes drop to a point where they could get U.S. government medical help.\nRohling, who directed Alabama's housing authority at the time, reached a startling conclusion: If children could drive parents into hardship when they became ill, could medical insurance help parents rediscover financial health?\n\"Health care for children really is a bridge to get out of poverty,\" said Rohling.\nRohling quit his job in 1988 to help set up the Child Caring Foundation, which provides free health insurance for children through the Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama health care provider.\nThe foundation is just one example of a charity that bridges the gap between Medicaid \u2014 subsidized insurance \u2014 for the poorest and private health insurance paid for either privately for those who can afford it, or by an employer.\nThat gap leaves up to 9 million U.S. children uninsured in the United States, a nation with no universal health care. Many parents are forced to struggle with a patchwork of other provisions in order to get health care for their children.\n\"The problem of the uninsured is getting worse,\" and the number of uninsured children has risen since 2004, said Jennifer Tolbert, principal analyst with the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, a Washington-based think tank.\nTolbert said it was possible the U.S. Congress could increase the scope of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) to provide greater state coverage for uninsured children when it debates reauthorizing the program next year.\nIn the lurch\nChildren with health insurance are usually taken to the doctor at the first sign of illness, while parents of uninsured kids often wait because they are conscious of the cost.\nThen the child's illness can worsen and the parent is forced to miss work to nurse the child back to health.\nIn Alabama, there were 230,000 uninsured children in 1988, and that has fallen to around 70,000 due to a combination of the Child Caring Foundation and state programs.\nJody Sharp, 60, is an example of the problem the charity aims to address.\nShe and her husband adopted a foster child, Dana, from a mother who was mentally handicapped. Later, they adopted Dana's brother Kyle who has epilepsy and asthma.\nBut Sharp's husband, the family wage earner, walked out in 1990, leaving Sharp to bring up the two children with no health insurance.\n\"If you never had a child with epilepsy, you would never know how many bills you can incur. With no insurance, it's thousands of dollars just like that,\" Sharp told Reuters.\nDuring their two years in the Alabama Blue Cross Blue Shield program, Sharp's children received free medical care and she found a job working with special needs children. The money saved helped her move into private health insurance.\nSome 90 percent of the 55,000 children on the program move into private health insurance within about 30 months.\n\"All of us have times when we lose jobs or lose our homes. You need the support of insurance so you don't have to worry about squeezing doctor bills out of an already stretched paycheck,\" said Sharp.\nBear's eye\nTo recruit families, Rohling tours the state presenting health screenings at schools with the help of volunteers from the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Nursing and elsewhere.\nAt one recent presentation, a student nurse pulled a teddy bear eye out of a child's ear, ending three years of one-sided deafness. It was an example of how problems can fester for children who don't have health insurance.\nLow cost health insurance for low income American children began in Pittsburgh in 1985 when Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of Western Pennsylvania insured children of laid-off steel workers. By 2006, 144,000 children were in their program.\n\"There was a crisis. And the whole thing came about as an answer for how health insurance should work,\" said spokesperson Denise Grabner of Highmark.\nIn 1997, the program expanded to include children of the working poor when Congress enacted the SCHIP providing some matching funding.\nAlabama was the first of 20 states to participate, creating the All Kids program, with money from state settlement with tobacco companies. The program provides insurance for children above the level at which they would qualify for Medicaid.\nMany states now provide insurance for families who earn up to double the poverty rate, defined as $10,000 a year for a single person and $20,000 for a family of four. But Rohling said an individual needed to earn nearly three times the poverty level to afford private insurance.\n\"We fill the void between affordability and eligibility.\"\n", "evaluation_span": [0, 4857], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [117, 127], "entity_id": "Q79867", "name": "Birmingham", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 1, "span": [129, 133], "entity_id": "Q173", "name": "Alabama", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 2, "span": [147, 157], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 3, "span": [287, 302], "entity_id": "Q48525", "name": "Federal Government of the United States", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 4, "span": [317, 324], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 5, "span": [339, 346], "entity_id": "Q173", "name": "Alabama", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 6, "span": [620, 627], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 7, "span": [629, 636], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 8, "span": [677, 700], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 9, "span": [764, 801], "entity_id": "Q4929026", "name": "Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 10, "span": [901, 909], "entity_id": "Q1141363", "name": "Medicaid", "type": "Q22222786|Q2424752"}, {"id": 11, "span": [1086, 1090], "entity_id": "Q30", "name": "United States of America", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 12, "span": [1117, 1130], "entity_id": "Q30", "name": "United States of America", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 13, "span": [1406, 1422], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 14, "span": [1502, 1512], "entity_id": "Q61", "name": "Washington, D.C.", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 15, "span": [1531, 1538], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 16, "span": [1564, 1577], "entity_id": "Q11268", "name": "United States Congress", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 17, "span": [1610, 1651], "entity_id": "<NO_MAPPING>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 18, "span": [1653, 1658], "entity_id": "<NO_MAPPING>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 19, "span": [2071, 2078], "entity_id": "Q173", "name": "Alabama", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 20, "span": [2192, 2215], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 21, "span": [2236, 2246], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 22, "span": [2477, 2482], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 23, "span": [2546, 2551], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 24, "span": [2761, 2766], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 25, "span": [2772, 2779], "entity_id": "Q130879", "name": "Reuters", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 26, "span": [2811, 2841], "entity_id": "Q4929026", "name": "Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 27, "span": [2851, 2856], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 28, "span": [3321, 3326], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 29, "span": [3360, 3367], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 30, "span": [3461, 3496], "entity_id": "Q1472663", "name": "University of Alabama at Birmingham", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 31, "span": [3497, 3514], "entity_id": "Q446901", "name": "nursing school", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 32, "span": [3821, 3831], "entity_id": "Q1342", "name": "Pittsburgh", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 33, "span": [3845, 3876], "entity_id": "Q5759565", "name": "Highmark", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 34, "span": [3880, 3900], "entity_id": "Q7988152", "name": "Western Pennsylvania", "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 35, "span": [4116, 4130], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 36, "span": [4134, 4142], "entity_id": "Q5759565", "name": "Highmark", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 37, "span": [4219, 4227], "entity_id": "Q11268", "name": "United States Congress", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 38, "span": [4240, 4245], "entity_id": "<NO_MAPPING>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 39, "span": [4279, 4286], "entity_id": "Q173", "name": "Alabama", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 40, "span": [4343, 4351], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 41, "span": [4510, 4518], "entity_id": "Q1141363", "name": "Medicaid", "type": "Q22222786|Q2424752"}, {"id": 42, "span": [4691, 4698], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}]}

{"id": 14, "title": "16452612", "text": "What we'll want in a president\nHow will American voters compensate in the 2008 election?\nWASHINGTON - Now that the 38th president has been laid to rest, the capital can take up the main business of 2007: trying to figure out who will be the 44th.\u00a0 What type of leader does the country want? Here is my sense of it, based on talking to politicians, strategists and voters here and around the nation.\nNo ideologues, please\nThere was a time when President George W. Bush's ideological certitude was politically appealing and perhaps functionally necessary. That time has long since passed. The country is tired, even fearful, of leaders with fervent beliefs that seem impervious to new (or even old) facts. Voters see the war in Iraq as an \"idea,\" not a solution \u2013 and Americans do not like ideas that do not work.\u00a0 Voters likely will view Bush's \"surge\" of troops into Iraq as new evidence of failure, and the dangers of a leader who depends on preconceived ideas.\nSerious student\nPresidential elections are a never-ending series of mid-course corrections. Voters look to compensate for the leadership weaknesses of the incumbent. An example comes from the life and career of Gerald Ford. In 1976, voters wanted a pure antidote to Richard Nixon's paranoid megalomania. Once Ford pardoned Nixon, he could not be that candidate. Instead, Americans chose Jimmy Carter, a peanut farmer who had never worked in Washington, and who promised never to lie to the American people. The counterpoint thinking continues. Voters in 2008 are going to want someone who prides himself (or herself) on spending time in the library \u2013 who has a hands-on curiosity about the details.\nWashington experience not necessary\nVoters these days not only do not value Washington experience \u2013 or any office-holding experience \u2013 it can make them suspicious. That is what strategists and polltakers for Sen. Evan Bayh found when they studied whether he should run for president. They found that his remarkably deep resume \u2013 the son of a senator, he was the \"boy governor\" of Indiana before going to the Senate \u2013 was as handicap. Americans always are dubious about the capital, but that sentiment seems particularly strong. Bayh decided not to run. \" `Washington' doesn't make the case,\" said Dan Pfeiffer, who worked for Bayh.\nNo more boomer obsessions\nNot all elections are about change, but 2008 will be. Americans are moderately upbeat about the country's prospects, but deeply worried about the world \u2013 and they have come to realize that they can't separate one from the other. One thing for sure, says Pfeiffer, voters are tired of arguing about the culture of the 1960s and other Boomer issues.\u00a0 \"There is a sense that the 2004 election was too much about who did or did not do what in Vietnam,\" said Pfeiffer, referring to the Bush campaign against Sen. John Kerry. In 2000, Bush won in part by selling himself as a \"grown up\" Boomer answer to Bill Clinton. \"Voters are tired of that era and its concerns,\" said Pfeiffer said. \"They want to move on.\"\nKnow the middle class\nBushes have a congenital family problem with this, and it leaves an opening for someone \u2013 of either party \u2013 who can prove that he or she really understands the strains of middle class life. It's not just about money, but about cultural assaults and the lack of time for family in an era when both parents or partners need to work. In his forthcoming book, Positively American, Sen. Charles Schumer of New York imagines the hard life of a fictitious middle class family \u2013 and offers a series of governmental proposals to address them. A shrewd student of the American mood, Schumer is aiming in the right direction. The next president will need to show that he or she understands that family.\n", "evaluation_span": [0, 3739], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [89, 99], "entity_id": "Q61", "name": "Washington, D.C.", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 1, "span": [443, 467], "entity_id": "Q207", "name": "George W.

{"id": 17, "title": "16454435", "text": "Upgrade makes aging Mars rovers smarter\nEngineers transmitted new software to the rovers' onboard computers\nLOS ANGELES - The twin Mars rovers are getting wiser with age.\nEngineers have transmitted new flight software to the rovers' onboard computers \u2014 just in time for the third anniversary of their landing. The software is aimed at boosting their intelligence and independence so that they can roll around the Red Planet with less help from humans.\n\"We're teaching an old dog new tricks,\" said John Callas, the mission project manager with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the NASA agency in charge of the rovers.\nAmong the rovers' new skills is the ability to automatically recognize and transmit to Earth photographs that they take of swirling dust devils or floating clouds. They can also independently decide whether it is safe to extend its robotic arm to sample a piece of rock.\nBefore, scientists had to painstakingly dissect thousands of images just to find the frames they need and decide for the rovers whether to use their arms. The high-tech upgrades should help save time \u2014 as much as a day because scientists on Earth don't have to study a rock before sending commands to the robot to pick it up.\nIf successful, the changes could get incorporated into future Mars missions.\nSpirit and Opportunity were also fitted with a new navigation system that allows them to think several steps ahead when faced with an obstacle, allowing them to back out of a dead end or even navigate a maze on their own, Callas said. The geologic robots have previously tackled one problem at a time.\nSpirit landed three years ago Wednesday and Opportunity on Jan. 24, 2004. Entering their fourth year of exploration, both golf cart-sized vehicles have long outlasted their missions, originally planned for about three months. While scientists are impressed by the rovers' longevity, they admit the robots could die at any time.\nThe rovers' biggest accomplishment is uncovering geologic evidence that water once flowed on Mars. Spirit is currently studying rocks and soil samples near a Martian ridge while Opportunity is circling the rim of a massive crater for possible ways in.\n", "evaluation_span": [0, 2171], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [20, 31], "entity_id": "Q389459", "name": "Mars rover", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 1, "span": [108, 119], "entity_id": "Q65", "name": "Los Angeles", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 2, "span": [131, 142], "entity_id": "Q389459", "name": "Mars rover", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 3, "span": [413, 423], "entity_id": "Q111", "name": "Mars", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 4, "span": [497, 508], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 5, "span": [547, 572], "entity_id": "Q189325", "name": "Jet Propulsion Laboratory", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 6, "span": [578, 582], "entity_id": "Q23548", "name": "National Aeronautics and Space Administration", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 7, "span": [702, 707], "entity_id": "Q2", "name": "Earth", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 8, "span": [1127, 1132], "entity_id": "Q2", "name": "Earth", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 9, "span": [1274, 1278], "entity_id": "Q111", "name": "Mars", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 10, "span": [1289, 1295], "entity_id": "Q176276", "name": "Spirit", "type": "Q2424752"}, {"id": 11, "span": [1300, 1311], "entity_id": "Q193538", "name": "Opportunity", "type": "Q2424752"}, {"id": 12, "span": [1511, 1517], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 13, "span": [1591, 1597], "entity_id": "Q176276", "name": "Spirit", "type": "Q2424752"}, {"id": 14, "span": [1635, 1646], "entity_id": "Q193538", "name": "Opportunity", "type": "Q2424752"}, {"id": 15, "span": [2012, 2016], "entity_id": "Q111", "name": "Mars", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 16, "span": [2018, 2024], "entity_id": "Q176276", "name": "Spirit", "type": "Q2424752"}, {"id": 17, "span": [2077, 2084], "entity_id": "Q913850", "name": "martians", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 18, "span": [2097, 2108], "entity_id": "Q193538", "name": "Opportunity", "type": "Q2424752"}]}
{"id": 18, "title": "16455207", "text": "Riley to have surgery on right knee\nMIAMI - Pat Riley is taking a break from a season that has left him limping and in pain.\nThe Miami Heat coach began an indefinite leave of absence Wednesday because of hip and knee problems, choosing assistant Ron Rothstein to fill his spot on an interim basis.\nRiley will have surgery Friday to remove floating chips in his right knee. Surgery on his hip, the malady that hurts him most now, is not yet scheduled. The 61-year-old coach doesn't know how long he'll be out.\n\"I'm going to be displaced for a while, but not disconnected at all,\" he said.\nMiami's record fell to 13-18 on Wednesday after a 110-95 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. Already this season, the Heat have seen Shaquille O'Neal, Dwyane Wade and Jason Williams \u2014 perhaps the three biggest keys in last year's championship run \u2014 miss many games with injuries.\nAnd now it's Riley's turn.\n\"We have a championship team that is sideways right now, so this is going to be a great challenge,\" Riley said. \"Keep your notebooks open. We'll see how it plays out.\"\nRiley, who also is the Heat president, resigned as coach shortly before the 2003-04 season, then returned to the bench in December 2005, replacing Stan Van Gundy and postponing right hip replacement surgery.\nIn September, after deciding against having offseason surgery, Riley said he didn't expect to need the operation this season, but the pain has apparently worsened in recent weeks.\n\"I'm just tired of the pain and the medication,\" Riley said.\nRiley was asked if the knee injury, or at its severity, stems in any way from him reportedly kicking a locker room door last week following a loss in Chicago.\n\"What I do in the locker room really has always been my business,\" Riley said.\nHeat center Alonzo Mourning said he didn't know if the kick made Riley's condition worse.\n\"Typical Riles,\" Mourning said. \"All the years that he's coached me I've seen him tear a lot of things up.\"\nRothstein was the Heat's first head coach in the 1988-89 season and lasted three years with the expansion franchise, finishing with a 57-189 record. His last full stint as an NBA head coach was with the 1992-93 Detroit Pistons, a team he guided to a 40-42 record, and he filled in for Riley for the final two games of last season while the coach visited his ailing mother.\n\"Listen, I haven't been in the first chair in an NBA game since 1993,\" said Rothstein, who also coached the WNBA's Miami Sol for three seasons. \"Coaching the WNBA was a totally different story. I don't mean to demean that at all. But this is different. So, I'm sort of curious to see how I'll feel and how I'll handle it.\"\nRiley's frustration has grown as the Heat have struggled this season, remaining mired below .500. Plus, on Wednesday he deactivated forwards Antoine Walker and James Posey because neither met a Jan. 1 deadline for a team conditioning goal regarding body fat.\nBut he said Wednesday the team's record did not factor into his decision to temporarily step aside now.\n\"We've had defensive lapses that are mind-boggling to me,\" Riley said. \"The offensive output will be corrected when Shaq and Dwyane and everybody's healthy. I don't think there's been any question about that. But I haven't been happy with our overall effort and defense all year long.\"\nThe Heat haven't had their preseason projected starting five together for any games yet this season because of all the injuries.\n\"We're all frustrated that we're not doing as well as we're supposed to be doing,\" O'Neal said. \"But there's a lot of iffy factors involved with that. Very soon, everybody will be back. That'll be the day we're looking forward to.\"\nWade, last season's finals MVP, was expected to miss his third straight game Wednesday because of a sprained wrist. A six-game Western swing begins Friday in Phoenix and the team hopes to get O'Neal back by the end of the trip.\n\"I haven't been happy about the situation,\" Riley said. \"I don't think anybody is. I hope that when everybody gets healthy, including myself, it'll rectify itself.\"\nRiley has a career record of 1,164-607, including Wednesday's loss, which counts against him. Last season's title run was vindication for Riley, who made sweeping roster changes after the 2005 playoffs. The championship was Riley's seventh and his fifth as a head coach, but his first since 1988 with the Showtime-era Los Angeles Lakers.\nOther marquee coaches have dealt with similar issues. Larry Brown missed 17 games with the Pistons two seasons ago following hip surgery, and Lakers coach Phil Jackson missed about a month before this season after his hip was replaced.\nBut, Riley cracks, that's no indication of how long he'll be out.\n\"I'm tougher than those guys,\" he said.\n", "evaluation_span": [0, 4725], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [0, 5], "entity_id": "Q335762", "name":

{"id": 19, "title": "3683270", "text": "Stocks end back-and-forth day slightly higher\nNEW YORK \u2014 Stocks finished an erratic session mixed Tuesday as higher commodity prices lifted energy and materials shares.\nMajor stock indexes had their third straight advance, reaching new 13-month highs, but there were more declining shares than advancers on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market. Stocks had zigzagged for much of the day on mixed news from retailers and industrial production.\nA rebound in the dollar after three down days kept investors' appetite for stocks in check. An eight-month weakening of the dollar has been lifting commodities prices and shares of U.S. exporters, which benefit from stronger foreign demand for their goods when the dollar falls. Record-low U.S. interest rates have also driven investors to seek higher returns in stocks and commodities, lifting share prices.\nTrading volume remained light, signaling a lack of strong conviction behind the market's moves.\nInvestors focused on retailers' earnings reports for insight into one of the market's biggest worries: how much consumers are spending. Home Depot Inc., Saks Inc. and Target Corp. all reported better-than-expected third-quarter results but also said they remain cautious ahead of the holiday shopping season.\n\"Despite the dramatic rally in the stock market, we still see the consumer operating at recessionary levels,\" said Uri Landesman, chief equity strategist and senior portfolio manager at ING Investment Management in New York. Stocks have surged in the past eight months as investors anticipate a recovery in the economy.\nStocks jumped Monday on a government report that retail sales rebounded in October. Investors are looking for signs that consumer spending, one of the biggest drivers of the U.S. economy, will recover during the holidays.\nA report on industrial production weighed on the market. The Fed said output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose 0.1 percent in October, less than the 0.4 percent predicted by economists polled by Thomson Reuters.\nMeanwhile, signs of inflation remained muted, a welcome sign for the economy. The Labor Department's Producer Price Index, which measures inflation at the wholesale level, rose less than expected in October. The 0.3 percent rise was smaller than economists had forecast.\n\"The market is saying inflation is not an issue,\" said Tim Courtney, chief investment officer at Oklahoma City-based Burns Advisory Group. He said that's a signal interest rates will remain low.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 30.46, or 0.3 percent, to 10,437.42. It was the ninth gain in 10 days for the Dow and its highest close since Oct. 2, 2008, when it ended at 10,482.85. The Dow jumped 136 points Monday after the retail sales report.\nThe broader Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 1.02, or 0.1 percent, to 1,110.32, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 5.93, or 0.3 percent, to 2,203.78.\nFalling stocks outpaced those that rose 8-to-7 on the NYSE, where volume came to 972 million shares compared with 1.1 billion Monday.\nThe Dow is up 725 points, or 7.5 percent, this month. That has some analysts saying the market has been rising too fast given problems like unemployment still facing the economy. For the year, the Dow is up 18.9 percent after rebounding from a 12-year low in March.\nA bounce in crude oil helped energy stocks. Oil rose 24 cents to settle at $79.14 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\nGold climbed 20 cents to $1,139.40. Gains in other metals spurred gains of materials companies. Platinum jumped $17.90 to $1,459 an ounce.\nBond prices edged higher to push yields lower. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note slipped to 3.33 percent from 3.34 percent late Monday.\nAmong energy and materials stocks, Exxon Mobil Corp. rose 60 cents to $75.03, while United States Steel Corp. rose 93 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $42.30.\nHome Depot fell 66 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $26.99, while Saks rose 26 cents, or 4.1 percent, to $5.67. Target fell $1.52, or 3 percent, to $48.77. Pacific Sunwear of California Inc. tumbled $1.13, or 22.6 percent, to $3.88 after its sales forecast fell short of expectations.\nThe Russell 2000 index of smaller companies slipped 0.53, or 0.1 percent, to 602.34.\nOverseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.6 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.7 percent, Germany's DAX index fell 0.5 percent, and France's CAC-40 lost 0.9 percent.\n", "evaluation_span": [0, 4425], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [46, 54], "entity_id": "Q60", "name": "New York City", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 1, "span": [311, 334], "entity_id": "Q13677", "name": "New York Stock Exchange", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 2, "span": [343, 362], "entity_id": "Q82059", "name": "Nasdaq", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 3, "span": [642, 646], "entity_id": "Q30", "name": "United States of America", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 4, "span": [1102, 1117], "entity_id": "Q864407", "name": "The Home Depot", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 5, "span": [1119, 1128], "entity_id": "Q7403084", "name": "Saks Incorporated", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 6, "span": [1133, 1145], "entity_id": "Q1046951", "name": "Target Corporation", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 7, "span": [1390, 1403], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 8, "span": [1461, 1486], "entity_id": "Q645708", "name": "ING Group", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 9, "span": [1490, 1498], "entity_id": "Q60", "name": "New York City", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 10, "span": [1874, 1881], "entity_id": "Q53536", "name": "Federal Reserve System", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 11, "span": [2030, 2045], "entity_id": "Q1141267", "name": "Thomson Reuters", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 12, "span": [2129, 2145], "entity_id": "Q628807", "name": "United States Department of Labor", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 13, "span": [2148, 2168], "entity_id": "Q2414538", "name": "Producer price index", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 14, "span": [2373, 2385], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 15, "span": [2415, 2428], "entity_id": "Q34863", "name": "Oklahoma City", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 16, "span": [2435, 2455], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 17, "span": [2517, 2545], "entity_id": "Q180816", "name": "Dow Jones Industrial Average", "type": "Q2424752"}, {"id": 18, "span": [2629, 2632], "entity_id": "Q180816", "name": "Dow Jones Industrial Average", "type": "Q2424752"}, {"id": 19, "span": [2779, 2804], "entity_id": "Q242345", "name": "S&P 500", "type": "Q2424752"}, {"id": 20, "span": [2857, 2863], "entity_id": "Q82059", "name": "Nasdaq", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 21, "span": [2974, 2978], "entity_id": "Q13677", "name": "New York Stock Exchange", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 22, "span": [3058, 3061], "entity_id": "Q180816", "name": "Dow Jones Industrial Average", "type": "Q2424752"}, {"id": 23, "span": [3420, 3448], "entity_id": "Q120233", "name": "New York Mercantile Exchange", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 24, "span": [3775, 3792], "entity_id": "Q156238", "name": "ExxonMobil", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 25, "span": [3824, 3849], "entity_id": "Q72539", "name": "U.S. Steel", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 26, "span": [3892, 3902], "entity_id": "Q864407", "name": "The Home Depot", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 27, "span": [3951, 3955], "entity_id": "Q7403084", "name": "Saks Incorporated", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 28, "span": [3997, 4003], "entity_id": "Q1046951", "name": "Target Corporation", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 29, "span": [4041, 4075], "entity_id": "Q7121857", "name": "PacSun", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 30, "span": [4174, 4192], "entity_id": "Q1329524", "name": "Russell 2000", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 31, "span": [4265, 4270], "entity_id": "Q17", "name": "Japan", "type": "Q27096213|Q4164871|Q43229"}, {"id": 32, "span": [4273, 4293], "entity_id": "Q507338", "name": "Nikkei 225", "type": "Q2424752"}, {"id": 33, "span": [4312, 4319], "entity_id": "Q23666", "name": "Great Britain", "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 34, "span": [4322, 4330], "entity_id": "Q466496", "name": "FTSE 100 Index", "type": "Q2424752"}, {"id": 35, "span": [4349, 4356], "entity_id": "Q183", "name": "Germany", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 36, "span": [4359, 4362], "entity_id": "Q155718", "name": "DAX", "type": "Q2424752"}, {"id": 37, "span": [4391, 4397], "entity_id": "Q142", "name": "France", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 38, "span": [4400, 4406], "entity_id": "Q648828", "name": "CAC 40", "type": "Q2424752"}]}
