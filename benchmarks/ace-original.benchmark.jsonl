The official, who wished to remain anonymous, told journalists: \"Iran will start accumulating nuclear capability for military purposes from 2005 and will be in a position, within the space of 10 years, to produce nuclear warheads that can be fitted to missiles capable of striking Israel.\"   The official made these statements after Tehran announced today Saturday that it had \"successfully\" completed a new test on the Shahab 3 ground-ground missile with a range of 1300 kilometers.   The official further said: \"Iran is not capable of developing a nuclear program without Moscow's help.\"   He said that according to information obtained by Israel, tests on the Shahab 3 ground-ground missile were in fact \"successful and reached their maximum range of 1300 kilometers which allows them to reach strategic centers in Israel.\"   The official said that the design of the Shahab missile is based on a North Korean missile called Nodong, itself developed from the Soviet Scud missile.   The official also stressed that Iran regards the \"destruction of Israel as legitimate,\" saying that \"Tehran is embroiled in strategic terrorist activities targeting Israel, especially alongside Palestinian and Lebanese organizations.\"   The official further considered that \"the Shahab missile will not come into operation for two years and that an improved range of 2000 kilometers would only be achieved after this period.\"   Israel's Deputy Defense Minister, Ephraim Sneh, said today Saturday that Israel would \"know how to find a suitable response\" to the Iranian Shahab 3 ground-ground missile with a 1300 kilometer range.   Sneh said on army radio that \"Israel will prepare itself to find a suitable response to this threat,\" without giving any further details.   The Iranian army announced today Saturday that it had \"successfully\" completed a new test on Shahab 3 ground-ground missiles.   An official at the Iranian Ministry of Defense told Tehran Radio that the \"Shahab 3 defense missile was tested a second time to ensure it conforms to international standards.\"   In July 1998, the first test on this missile was announced. It is capable of reaching the majority of countries in the region, including Israel. \n", "evaluation_span": [0, 2507], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [0, 9], "entity_id": "Q1218", "name": "Jerusalem", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 1, "span": [16, 19], "entity_id": "Q40464", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 2, "span": [104, 108], "entity_id": "Q794", "name": "Iran", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 3, "span": [875, 881], "entity_id": "Q649", "name": "Moscow", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 4, "span": [2210, 2229], "entity_id": "Q1089480", "name": "Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 5, "span": [2235, 2247], "entity_id": "Unknown", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "OTHER"}]}

According to official sources, the Lebanese authorities contacted the peacekeeping high command and asked it to put an end to infringements by Israel, which is carrying out operations inside Lebanese territory, in particular dumping sand and building slopes.   The source added that if this is confirmed, then such acts constitute a provocation and an infringement of Lebanese sovereignty.   Witnesses said two Israeli bulldozers started work today Tuesday on a slope in the Abbad sector inside Lebanese territory on the border between Lebanon and Israel.   These witnesses told Agence France Presse that an Israeli army patrol equipped with ultra-modern binoculars penetrated a few meters into Lebanese territory but withdrew back to Israeli territory as soon as a peacekeeping patrol arrived.   Families in southern Lebanon visit this area where, according to tradition, the burial site of Sheikh Abbad, who died 500 years ago, is located.  For their part, Israelis also regard the site as a shrine because, according to them, Rabbi Ashi lived there in the 5th century.   The Israeli army had previously carried out operations inside Lebanese territory in the same border region on August 11.   Last Friday, an Israeli bulldozer crossed the wire fence in Wadi Marjayoun near the Israeli village of Matla and spread sand over a length of hundreds of meters and a width of six meters in order to expose the footprints of people crossing the border or tire prints of cars from the Lebanese side. \n", "evaluation_span": [0, 1738], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [0, 6], "entity_id": "Q3820", "name": "Beirut", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 1, "span": [13, 16], "entity_id": "Q40464", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 2, "span": [21, 28], "entity_id": "Q822", "name": "Lebanon", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 3, "span": [138, 144], "entity_id": "Q801", "name": "Israel", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 4, "span": [717, 729], "entity_id": "Unknown", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 5, "span": [1499, 1513], "entity_id": "Unknown", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "OTHER"}]}

The presidents met for a working lunch of around 75 minutes.   The American official stressed that what is important in Putin's proposal is that it falls within the \"framework adopted by the United States and Russia to discuss strategic issues from a defensive and offensive point of view.\"   Putin proposed limiting the Russian and American nuclear capabilities by reducing the number of nuclear heads to under 1500 each, a smaller number than that in the Russian-American Start-3 treaty currently being negotiated.  He proposed that the current reduction should be between 2500 to 2000 nuclear heads.   Putin said this reduction would depend on compliance with the Russian-American anti-ABM missile treaty signed in 1972, which the Americans are attempting to amend to set up anti- missile defenses (NMD).   Washington has so far confirmed agreeing to the 2000 to 2500 nuclear warhead ceiling.  The United States has not taken a final position on the NMD system because Clinton, whose term ends in January, is leaving the decision in this matter to his successor.   In response to a question about Republican presidential candidate George Bush Junior's approach to deploying the NMD system, more ambitious than the one proposed by the Clinton administration, the American official said the United States would continue \"complying with the present framework\" in these strategic discussions.   He added \"while this framework does not reflect the basic interests of the United States, we feel it is still a valid approach in our discussions with Russia on this matter.\"   He also said that Clinton raised the issue of the transfer of sensitive Russian technology to Iran, adding \"President Putin has expressed his agreement that these are real threats and is strongly committed to limiting this, but there is still a lot of work to do\" in this area.   Clinton also touched on the matter of American Edmond Bob who is being tried in a closed court in Russia on charges of spying.

The problem arose after Palestinian Mahmood Abu Talib, whose testimony the court has been hearing since Friday, refused to continue answering a question by defense lawyer Richard Keen about the detailed reasons for his having lived in the former Soviet Union for a period of 18 months in the 70s.   The lawyer asked the judges to force Abu Talib to answer the question aimed at demonstrating the witness's \"professional terrorism\" precedents.   46-year-old Abu Talib was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1990 in Sweden for terrorist acts in Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Stockholm between 1985 and 1986. The defense council in the Lockerbie court is attempting to show his involvement in the Lockerbie attack.   Based on Scottish law, followed in this court, if Abu Talib insists on not responding to the question, this is considered to be \"contempt of court\" and means he may be punished in accordance with Scottish law covering such incidents.   The problem is that the judges may not punish Abu Talib unless Sweden hands him over to Scotland after the court case ends to apply the punishment for \"contempt of court.\"   So far, the judges have not asked Abu Talib to answer the defense's question in what appears to be a move to avoid a tricky situation if the witness refuses to answer.   The court president, Ronald Sutherland, who adjourned the session for a short while in an attempt to find a solution to this dilemma, said \"this raises an important question of principle.\"   The two Libyans, Alameen Khalifa Fahima and Abdulbasit al-Maqrahi, are suspected of sending a bomb from Malta which was used to explode the Pan Am plane over the Scottish village of Lockerbie on December 21, 1988 killing 270 people. \n", "evaluation_span": [0, 2040], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [0, 10], "entity_id": "Q10056", "name": "Zeist", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 1, "span": [12, 19], "entity_id": "Q102911", "name": "Holland", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 2, "span": [28, 31], "entity_id": "Q40464", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 3, "span": [572, 584], "entity_id": "Q15180", "name": "Soviet Union", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 4, "span": [839, 845], "entity_id": "Q34", "name": "Sweden", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 5, "span": [868, 877], "entity_id": "Q727", "name": "Amsterdam", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 6, "span": [879, 889], "entity_id": "Q1748", "name": "Copenhagen", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 7, "span": [894, 903], "entity_id": "Q1754", "name": "Stockholm", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 8, "span": [1823, 1845], "entity_id": "Q5729604", "name": "Lamin Khalifah Fhimah", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q18336849"}, {"id": 9, "span": [1850, 1871], "entity_id": "Q307773", "name": "Abdelbaset al-Megrahi", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q18336849"}, {"id": 10, "span": [1910, 1915], "entity_id": "Q233", "name": "Malta", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}]}

Palestinian President Yasser Arafat had symbolically announced a Palestinian state on November 15, 1988 in Algeria when the first Palestinian Intifada was at its height and which continued for seven years until the Oslo peace accords were signed in 1993. \n", "evaluation_span": [0, 2165], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [0, 5], "entity_id": "Unknown", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 1, "span": [7, 14], "entity_id": "Q822", "name": "Lebanon", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 2, "span": [23, 26], "entity_id": "Q40464", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 3, "span": [196, 224], "entity_id": "Q1585629", "name": "Palestinian National Council", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q4164871|Q43229"}, {"id": 4, "span": [228, 235], "entity_id": "Q262", "name": "Algeria", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 5, "span": [290, 300], "entity_id": "Unknown", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 6, "span": [306, 311], "entity_id": "Q82070", "name": "Tyre", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 7, "span": [328, 334], "entity_id": "Q3820", "name": "Beirut", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 8, "span": [446, 461], "entity_id": "Q2746536", "name": "Muhammad al-Durrah incident", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 9, "span": [706, 711], "entity_id": "Q163490", "name": "Sidon", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 10, "span": [729, 736], "entity_id": "Q822", "name": "Lebanon", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 11, "span": [964, 975], "entity_id": "Unknown", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 12, "span": [1316, 1325], "entity_id": "Q1218", "name": "Jerusalem", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}]}

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ In his foreign policy debut as Syria's president, Bashar Assad met Sunday with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in talks on Mideast peace and the escalating violence in the Palestinian territories.   Assad, on his first trip abroad since becoming president in July, also dealt with the issue of Iraq in the talks with Mubarak, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Mussa said.   The Syrian leader's visit came on a fourth day of clashes that have raged in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Jerusalem, leaving more than two dozen Palestinians dead.   ``There is complete agreement (between Mubarak and Assad) as to the seriousness of the situation and that the negative repercussions would adversely effect the peace process, which is in itself in a very precarious state,'' Moussa said.   Assad, 35, has focused on domestic issues since his father, Hafez Assad, died in June after 30 years in power. He has taken steps to modernize his nation's bureaucracy and revive its stagnant economy.   ``This was the first meeting of the first visit of President Bashar Assad after the funeral of his father, so it was only normal for the discussions to have a general tone ... in addition to certain specifics of special importance to both countries and the Arab world,'' Moussa said.   The late Syrian president rarely traveled abroad. In his last few years, however, he had sent Bashar, educated as an eye doctor, on foreign trips as part of his grooming to become president.   Prospects appear dim for progress on either the Syrian or Palestinian peace track. The deadlock in Palestinian-Israeli talks is exacerbated by the worst violence in four years. Syria's government-run media said last week that no progress could be expected now because of the U.S. elections and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's precarious situation as leader of a minority government.   Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations broke down in January, with Syria demanding a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau captured by Israel in 1967. Israel insists on waiting to settle borders until it knows what it will gain by returning Golan land.   Assad has made it clear he intends to follow his father's course in any negotiations with Israel.   Mubarak and Assad met after a week when Russia, France, Jordan and Yemen sent planes to Baghdad, challenging U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Iraq is hoping other Arab countries will follow, despite U.S. complaints, easing its isolation.   Moussa said the presidents discussed the situation in Iraq and would return to it Monday. However, he would not comment on whether Syria and Egypt were planning to send planes to Baghdad.   Egypt and Syria are on good terms, but they have had their differences. Hafez Assad's attempts to rally Arab leaders to present a unified front against Israel gained little ground. He derided Egypt for signing a peace treaty with Israel in 1979.  \n", "evaluation_span": [0, 2951], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [0, 5], "entity_id": "Q85", "name": "Cairo", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 1, "span": [7, 12], "entity_id": "Q79", "name": "Egypt", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 2, "span": [14, 16], "entity_id": "Q40469", "name": "Associated Press", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 3, "span": [51, 56], "entity_id": "Q858", "name": "Syria", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 4, "span": [108, 117], "entity_id": "Q15618993", "name": "President of Egypt", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q4164871"}, {"id": 5, "span": [315, 319], "entity_id": "Q796", "name": "Iraq", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 6, "span": [472, 481], "entity_id": "Q36678", "name": "West Bank", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 7, "span": [483, 493], "entity_id": "Q39760", "name": "Gaza Strip", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 8, "span": [498, 507], "entity_id": "Q1218", "name": "Jerusalem", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}]}
{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The youngest son of ex-dictator Suharto disobeyed a summons to surrender himself to prosecutors Monday and be imprisoned for corruption.   Hutomo ``Tommy'' Mandala Putra, 37, was sentenced to 18 months in prison on Sept. 22 by the Supreme Court, which overturned an earlier acquittal by a lower court.   It found him guilty of enriching himself through a property deal with the state's main food supply agency. Prosecutors said the 1997 deal, made when his father was still in power, had cost the Indonesian state $10.8 million.   Tommy, a multimillionaire with a playboy image and love of fast cars, is the first member of Suharto's family to be convicted of graft.   Because the Supreme Court's decision to imprison Tommy did not come into immediate effect, prosecutors served a summons on Tommy to be taken into custody Monday. He instead sent a legal team to discuss whether he would appeal the ruling or admit his guilt and seek a presidential pardon.   The delay of Tommy's arrest comes just days after another court dismissed other corruption charges against his 79-year-old father on grounds of ill health, enraging pro-democracy activists and triggering violent demonstrations.   Critics of Indonesia's legal system have accused it of going soft on the Suharto clan.   A co-defendant in Tommy's case, businessman Riccardo Gelael, separately admitted his guilt Monday to prosecutors and said he would appeal to President Abdurrahman Wahid for a pardon.   Antasari Ashar, chief of South Jakarta Prosecution Office, said Tommy would again be summoned to meet prosecutors on Wednesday.   If Tommy opts for a judicial review of the case, his fate will be decided by the same court that last week dismissed graft charges against his father.   The decision to let Suharto off triggered fierce street demonstrations, in which one man died and dozens were injured.   For weeks Suharto's trial had been marred by a series of bombings in Jakarta, including a blast at the city's stock exchange building in which 15 people were killed.   Many suspect supporters of Suharto, who ruled for 32 years until his ouster in 1998, were behind the attacks.  \n", "evaluation_span": [0, 2173], "labels": []}
{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) _ The price of a college degree continues to rise faster than inflation, with tuition and fees at public four-year colleges up an average 4.4 percent this fall, even more at private schools, a new survey has found. And loans provide a growing chunk of the extra money students need to pay for those degrees.   Average in-state tuition and fees at public, four-year schools is $3,510 per semester _ $148 more than last year, according to figures released Monday by the College Board. On-campus room and board now averages $4,960, up 5.1 percent.   At private four-year colleges, tuition and fees average $16,332, up 5.2 percent from last year. Room and board on campus is now $6,209, a 4.2 percent increase.   Only public two-year schools, chiefly community colleges, stayed below the current inflation rate _ but barely. Tuition rose this year to $1,705, up 3.4 percent, the survey found.   Private two-year schools boosted tuition and fees to $7,458, a 7 percent rise.   This pattern follows an old, familiar trend, said Joni Finney, a policy analyst at the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education in San Jose, Calif. ``Colleges and universities have a very difficult time controlling their costs,'' she said.   ``These institutions were underfunded in the early part of the '90s,'' Finney said. ''... But they've more than made up for lost ground.''   But Stanley Eikenberry, president of the American Council on Education, an umbrella group for higher education, said in a statement, ``Given the large, fixed costs of most campuses, in personnel and facilities especially, these numbers show institutions are working hard to hold the line on increases.''   The recent increases push past inflation. The Consumer Price Index rose 2.7 percent in 1999; the first eight months of this year, consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 3.5 percent. Last year, college tuition and fees rose less than 5 percent.   Despite the increases, college remains affordable and a good investment, said College Board President Gaston Caperton in a statement with the surveys. ``In both earning potential and learning potential, you cannot beat the value of a college education,'' the former West Virginia governor said.   The College Board's figures concern the costs for 6.4 million full-time undergraduates _ 54 percent attending four-year public institutions, 27 percent at four-year private schools, 17 percent at two-year community colleges and 1 percent at private two-year schools.   A majority of students need grants or loans _ or both _ but their exact numbers are unknown, a College Board spokesman said.   Last school year, loans made up 59 percent of a record $68 billion in financial aid. A decade ago, loans made up just over 41 percent of student financial help.   The pool of money from federal, state and school sources last year was 4 percent greater than a year earlier, but 88 percent more than a decade before, taking inflation into account.   The New York-based College Board is a nonprofit organization that administers the SATs and promotes higher education.   It surveyed more than 3,000 schools to find out undergraduate charges for 2000-2001. The companion survey on financial aid, was based on federal, state and school statistics from 1999-2000. Current grant and loan figures are not available until the school year ends.   ____   On the Net: http://www.collegeboard.org   American Council on Education: http://www.acenet.edu  \n", "evaluation_span": [0, 3472], "labels": []}
{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "ST. LOUIS (AP) _ As Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore prepared to perch on stools and take voters' questions in a crucial third debate, the sudden death of Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan cast a pall over their final meeting.   After talk of cancellation or a postponement for mourning, plans were made early Tuesday to continue the 9 p.m. EDT event on schedule, officials of both campaigns said.   ``In the end, there was general agreement that Mel Carnahan would have wanted us to go forward,'' a senior Bush campaign official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.   Bush's wife, Laura, canceled plans for a morning rally. Bush campaign officials also decided to tone down a post-debate rally, and were even considering canceling it. Gore hadn't planned any events before the debate.   Carnahan, a Democrat who was running for the Senate, campaigned with Gore whenever the vice president was in Missouri and would have accompanied Gore aboard Air Force II to a Kansas City rally on Wednesday. Gore called Mrs. Carnahan with his condolences after the news broke Monday night, aides said.   ``We're all waking up, honestly, to the tragedy and the pain of it and the shock of it,'' Democratic vice presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman said Tuesday morning on CNN.   The Bush and Gore campaigns did not talk to each other directly about the possibility of postponement, but went through the debate commission's director, Janet Brown, in a series of pre-dawn phone calls.   Eventually, Brown recommended that the debate should go on, and neither side objected, according to campaign officials.   The commission was to announce the plans later Tuesday, with each candidate given time at the debate's start to say a few words about Carnahan, who died Monday night in the crash of a small plane.   With the larger bloc of uncommitted voters across the nation apparently holding the key to the election, both candidates were clearly mindful of the high stakes if the encounter goes forward as planned.   The informal question-and-answer format is one Gore is comfortable with, and he promised on Monday to ``just have an open meeting,'' as he had done many times before.   Bush, who has less formal debate experience than the vice president but whose standing in public opinion polls rose after the first two face-offs, vowed to ``just tell it like it is.''   The debate, just three weeks before the Nov. 7 election, will be held on the campus of Washington University.   While the moderator will be the same as in the Boston and Winston-Salem, N.C., debates _ Jim Lehrer of PBS _ questions this time will come from the audience.   The Gallup polling organization, assigned by the Commission on Presidential Debates to recruit questioners, started with a random sample of all registered voters in St. Louis and its suburbs, and then screened out all but ``uncommitted voters,'' said Frank Newport, Gallup's executive editor.   The result was a group of area voters who say they could support either Gore or Bush _ though they might be leaning one way or the other.   The theater-in-the-round stage will be informally set with two stools and surrounded by 100 questioners and an additional 500 onlookers.   Tuesday night's debate marks the beginning of the final stretch.   And, with polls continuing to show the race to be neck-and-neck, any stumble could have major impact on a contest in which both candidates are fiercely wooing a dwindling band of undecided voters.   Gore held a mock debate on Monday, inviting 23 voters to the Innsbrook resort outside St. Louis to help him practice.   ``I'm going to do what I've done a lot of times in Tennessee, and that is, just have an open meeting,'' Gore said.   In 16 years in Congress, Gore held some 1,000 town meetings with Tennessee constituents, and they've become a regular feature of his presidential campaign.   After an uncharacteristically muted demeanor in last week's debate, Gore, was looking to do better this time.   ``I don't think you play it safe,'' said Gore's campaign chairman, William Daley, previewing the Tuesday night encounter. ``I think you try to be very natural and lay out in a forward way the compelling reasons for the election to go your way.''   Bush had long resisted the town-hall-style session, but in recent weeks on the campaign trail has been doing them almost daily.   ``I've felt comfortable about it,'' the Republican said Monday.  \n", "evaluation_span": [0, 4431], "labels": []}

Floodwaters throughout the region, including the raging Po River, have ebbed, emptying into the Adriatic and revealing a rising toll of damage. Some roads and bridges are still closed and could remain so for some time, officials say.   The death toll from the raging floodwaters and fearsome mudslides reached 37 combined for the Alpine region of northern Italy and southern Switzerland. Eighteen of those were from the Valle d'Aosta in the Italian Alps.   At the church of San Maurizio in Fenis, a mountain hamlet near the city of Aosta, villagers paid their final respects to five local victims. Among them, double losses for two families _ a father and son in one, a mother and daughter in another.   Amid the grief in communities throughout the stricken area, life was slowly returning to something resembling normal. But thousands were still unable to go back to their drenched or damaged homes and a huge task of rebuilding lay ahead.

(AP) _ The wife of Patrick Roy, the NHL's winningest goalie, called 911 because she was afraid of what her husband would do as they argued about in-laws, according to a police report released Monday.   Michele Roy was not hurt during the dispute at their home early Sunday, but Roy admitted pulling a bedroom door off its hinges and damaging another after his wife called Greenwood Village police and hung up without speaking, the report said.   The somber Colorado Avalanche goalie, accompanied by his parents, sister and brother, stood with his hands clasped behind his back during a brief court appearance.   The initial hearing was postponed until Nov. 7. Roy remained free on a $750 bail and left by a side door without comment. His wife was absent.   The judge also issued a restraining order that is standard in domestic-dispute cases, which requires Roy to refrain from alcohol and illegal drugs and possession of guns or weapons. He was permitted to return home to his family and is allowed to travel with the team to out-of-state games.   After the Avalanche's practice, Roy read a brief statement, noting that he could not comment on his arrest on the advice of his lawyer. He also asked that the public respect his family's privacy.   ``Obviously, this is creating a distraction, and my wish is that this distraction will be over soon,'' he said. ``I am thankful for the support I am getting from my family and every one of my teammates.''   Colorado players showed unified support for Roy, saying they believe he will remain focused after an eight-game (6-0-2) unbeaten streak to start the season. The team's next game is at home Wednesday against Nashville.   ``We've always stuck together and we'll stick by Patrick,'' defenseman Ray Bourque said. ``We know he is a quality person and a great family man.''   Defenseman Aaron Miller said, ``Until we find out exactly what's going on, we're not going to let it bother us or distract us. I think I speak for the whole team that we're behind Patty 100 percent.''   Roy, 35, was arrested and charged Sunday with misdemeanor criminal mischief which occurred during an act of domestic violence.   If convicted, he faces a maximum of one year in the county jail and a $1,000 fine, said a spokesman for the Arapahoe County district attorney's office.   Officers responded to the 911 hang-up call at Roy's residence, where Michele Roy told them the two had been arguing.   Roy was honored Friday night for winning his 448th game three days before, a 4-3 victory in overtime against the Washington Capitals.

The Taliban are predominantly Sunni Muslim, which is the majority Islamic sect in the country.   The Taliban have been accused by international human rights groups of mistreating the minority Shiite Muslims, a charge they reject.   The newly released prisoners were captured when the Taliban took control of Afghanistan's central Bamyan province, nearly two years ago.

And even the Dallas Stars are lending a hand in trying to win over the All-Star shortstop.   Rodriguez and agent Scott Boras were expected to meet Monday with Rangers owner Tom Hicks. He will be joined by general manager Doug Melvin, manager Johnny Oates and several players.   The team's bid for Rodriguez hasn't been slowed by the expected demand of at least a 10-year contract, in the range of $20 million a year, loaded with fringe benefits.   ``We feel at the expense of last year, we have our roster where we don't have to trade people to make this work,'' Melvin said in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram on Monday. ``I'm not saying we have all the money in the world, but we don't have to bust our budget completely. We're in a better position than most other clubs.''   Stars center Mike Modano is being called in to help show Rodriguez around the Dallas-Fort Worth area and tell him why it would be a great place to play.   Melvin said he doesn't expect the Rangers to make a formal offer until they can gauge the level of interest from Rodriguez.   The 25-year-old shortstop, who hit .316 with 41 homers and 132 RBIs at Seattle last season, also reportedly has been targeted by the Chicago White Sox, Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Mets and Atlanta Braves.   The Mariners, Rodriguez's team the past six years, also wanted to re-sign him.   ``This gives us a chance to tell him about our organization and the direction we're going, answer any questions they might have about us,'' Melvin said.   Some even have a neighborhood _ the fashionable Dallas suburb of Highland Park _ picked out for Rodriguez. Neighbors of one available residence _ a five-bedroom spread worth $11.95 million _ would include Hicks, Modano and Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones.   ``Alex needs to buy this house,'' Ronda Needham, a listing agent, told The Dallas Morning News. ``The people who own this house set it up around their two baseball-playing sons. It's a very sports-minded house.''   The Mets, once considered the favorites to get Rodriguez, have slowed their chase. General manager Steve Phillips publicly criticized some of the demands supposedly made by Boras. But the agent says Rodriguez is making no special demands.   ``I can't anticipate any change that would draw us back into it,'' Phillips said.  \n", "evaluation_span": [0, 2441], "labels": []}
{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "LONDON (AP) _ After three defeats in the House of Lords, Britain's Labor government resorted to rarely used powers Thursday to pass legislation lowering the age of consent for homosexuals from 18 to 16.   House of Commons speaker Michael Martin said he was invoking the Parliament Act to force through a Sexual Offenses Bill that makes the age of consent the same for both homosexuals and heterosexuals. It became law after being given Royal Assent by Queen Elizabeth II.   Lawmakers in the House of Commons overwhelmingly approved the bill earlier this year, but the House of Lords this month rejected it for the third time.   The Lords' powers, however, are limited to delaying legislation by blocking it and bouncing it back to the House of Commons. The Parliament Act was created to ensure that the will of the country's elected lawmakers prevails.   The bill brings Britain in line with most other European Union nations.   ``It is a reform which, in my personal view, is long overdue and is only right for a country that has a history of reform and challenging prejudice,'' said Home Secretary Jack Straw, Britain's top law enforcement officer.   ``This act will help us to build a safe, just and tolerant society,'' he added.   Angela Mason, director of the gay rights group Stonewall, said Parliament's action was ``a great step toward equality.''   ``When the history books come to be written I believe it will be seen as the moment when this country finally began to change, when lesbians and gay men started to take our place as equal members of society,'' she said.   Peter Tatchell, of the group OutRage!, said: ``This victory is a welcome and historic milestone in the long struggle for gay human rights.''   ``My only regret is that it has taken 33 years during which time hundreds of gay men have been unjustly jailed for victimless relationships.''   However, family values campaigner and Conservative ex-Leader of the Lords Baroness Young accused the government of behaving in a ``completely dictatorial manner'' toward Parliament.   Straw dismissed the criticism. ``In the circumstances I believe that the use of the Parliament Act in this case is proper and justified,'' he said.   Five years ago, Parliament narrowly rejected lowering the age of consent for homosexuals to 16, reducing it instead from 21 to 18. Homosexual sex between adults ceased to be a crime in Britain three decades ago.  \n", "evaluation_span": [0, 2416], "labels": []}
{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "PHOENIX (AP) _ Boise State coach Dirk Koetter, who just a day earlier was reportedly headed for Oklahoma State, has agreed to a contract to coach Arizona State.   Oklahoma State athletic director Terry Don Phillips confirmed Koetter's decision in a news release issued Friday night.   ``Coach Koetter informed me at approximately 7 p.m. (CST) tonight that he had been tendered an offer from Arizona State University and had accepted,'' Phillips said.   Koetter, 41, replaces Bruce Snyder, who was fired after nine seasons. Snyder will coach Arizona State in a bowl game, most likely the Las Vegas Bowl.   The Daily Oklahoman and several TV and radio stations in Oklahoma had reported Thursday and Friday that Koetter had accepted the Oklahoma State job.   But Phillips never confirmed those reports, and Koetter would not comment on any job possibilities at Boise State's practice Friday. Koetter said earlier in the week he had interviewed with Phillips and with Arizona State athletic director Gene Smith.   Koetter is considered one of the country's top young coaching prospects. Using an innovative, wide-open offense, he guided Boise State to a 25-10 record in three seasons. His first team went 6-5, followed by last year's 10-3 record, which included a 34-31 victory over Louisville in the Humanitarian Bowl.   This year's team is 9-2, with its only losses 38-31 at Arkansas and 42-25 at Washington State.   Koetter may not have been Arizona State's top choice.   Phoenix radio station KMVP reported Friday that Smith had quietly been working on a deal with TCU coach Dennis Franchione that would have matched the one offered by Alabama. But Franchione apparently couldn't resist the lure of one of college football's most storied programs.   While most of the recent speculation centered on Koetter, there was pressure from some Arizona State boosters to hire Danny White, the former Arizona State and Dallas Cowboys quarterback who coaches the Arizona Rattlers of the Arena Football League.   Snyder was fired after his teams went 6-6 last year and 6-5 this season.  \n", "evaluation_span": [0, 2077], "labels": []}

Watts joked Saturday night that he had revised returns on the presidential election: ``Al Gore, 9,834 lawsuits. George W. Bush, 7,652.''   Watts, chairman of the House Republican Conference, bantered about the Florida election dispute in a speech prepared for a dinner of The Gridiron Club at the Greenbrier Hotel.   ``I knew things had really deteriorated when Yasser Arafat offered to broker a peace between Bush and Gore,'' Watts said.   The Gridiron Club is an organization of 60 Washington journalists. Its dinners feature parodies of politics and government, and humorous speeches by political figures.   Watts noted that the presidential election of 1876 was so disputed that a congressional commission was created to settle it. ``I didn't know this until Strom Thurmond told me he cast the deciding vote.   ``Strom will be 98 next Tuesday,'' Watts said. ``Of course, he was only 67 when the recount of Florida ballots began.''   Watts said he had fond memories of Florida because he was the quarterback when the University of Oklahoma won the Orange Bowl there in 1980 and 1981. ``But our victory in '81 was by a single point and it was weeks before it was confirmed,'' he said. ``By the way, I recently learned Al Gore was pulling for Florida State and demanded a recount.''   As is traditional in Gridiron speeches, Watts concluded on a serious note. ``Once-in-a-century oddities may leave an election result up in the air for a time, but the fundamental strength of our democracy is never in doubt,'' he said.   ``Better a process driven by an army of lawyers than an outrage led by an army with guns,'' he said.  \n", "evaluation_span": [0, 1683], "labels": []}
{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) _ Fossil remains of a 120 million-year-old bird with unique feathers cast doubt on the theory of birds evolving from dinosaurs, some experts say, but others disagree.   Two Chinese researchers report that a fossil called Protopteryx _ from a group of flying animals called Enantiornithine _ includes feathers that are ``different from those of all other known fossil and modern feathers.''   Fucheng Zhang and Zhonghe Zhou of the Chinese Academy of Sciences suggest in the journal Science that the discovery supports the idea that feathers evolved from scales, like those found in reptiles. The study was to be published Friday.   Some researchers who oppose the idea that birds evolved from dinosaurs embraced the new fossil as proof that birds and dinosaurs evolved independently from a common reptilian ancestor.   But others say Protopteryx adds nothing to the dino-bird debate.   ``There is nothing in the skeleton of this bird that disputes the dinosaur origin of birds,'' said Thomas R. Holtz Jr., a University of Maryland paleobiologist and specialists on bird evolution. ``The fact that this Protopteryx has these weird flat feathers really doesn't affect that issue.''   Alan Feduccia, an evolutionary biologist at the University of North Carolina, said the Chinese study of Protopteryx ``is a hot paper ... that directly contradicts the idea that birds evolved from dinosaurs.''   The new fossil was unveiled the day after researchers announced that another ancient Chinese bird, called Microraptor zhaoianus, supported the dinosaur origin of birds.   In the study, Zhang and Zhou described the feather and bone structure found in a fossil of a starling-sized bird uncovered in northern China, the site of many dinosaur fossil finds.   The Chinese researchers said the feathers have some of the characteristics of modern feathers, but the structure is more primitive than feathers found on Archaeopteryx, the earliest known bird.   Archaeopteryx appeared about 145 million years ago, while Protopteryx was dated as more recent, about 120 million years ago. Microraptor, which was about the size of a crow, lived about 125 million years ago.   Some elements of the Protopteryx wing bone and muscle structure match those of modern birds, said Zhang and Zhou, but the wing retains a claw found on some primitive birdlike animals. In modern birds, that claw has disappeared and been replaced with a structure that adds lift to the wing. Nonetheless, Protopteryx is thought to have been a competent flier.   Most dinosaur researchers believe birds evolved 150 to 180 million years ago from a dinosaur group called Theropods. Researchers cite fundamental skeleton similarities to support the theory. The evolution of feathers, however, has been less clear.   Some experts believe feathers evolved specifically to support flight, while others say feathers evolved first to provide warmth or protection from water.   Fossils of three theropods bear hairlike images that some say could be the early precursors to feathers.   But Feduccia dismisses the theropod hair as ``dino fuzz'' and cites the Zhang and Zhou paper as proof that feathers evolved from reptilian scales and that this could mean that birds evolved independent of dinosaurs.   ``Bird feathers are very closely related to scales,'' said Feduccia. ``It is clear they evolved from elongated scales. Dino fuzz has nothing to do with feathers.''   Larry Martin, a University of Kansas paleontologist, said the Chinese researchers' paper ``is the strongest evidence yet that bird feathers evolved for flight and that they were derived from scales.''   Holtz, however, notes that Protopteryx, with its primitive feathers, lived millions of years after Archaeopteryx, which had feathers almost identical to those of modern birds.   ``This means the feathers on Protopteryx were probably an evolutionary reversal,'' said Holtz, adding that there are many examples where such reversals occur in nature.   ``This just shows that feathers are extremely adaptable structures,'' he said.   Michael Novacek, a dinosaur expert at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, says that the Zhang and Zhou study is ``ambiguous'' on the issue of dinosaurs and birds.   ``The fact that you see a resemblance between scales and feathers doesn't eliminate dinosaurs as close relatives to birds,'' said Novacek. He, too, said that evolution reversals are not rare. He said, for example, that whale ancestors lived on land and had fur, but evolution carried the huge mammals back to the sea.   Holtz said the Zhang and Zhou study is important because it adds new understanding about the Enantiornithine, a bird group that dominated the latter part of the age of dinosaurs.   ``The Enantiornithine got clobbered in the extinction event'' that killed off the dinosaurs about 65 million years ago, he said.   This was followed by the dominance of another bird group, the Ornithurae, which later evolved into modern birds, said Holtz.   ___   On the Net:   Science journal: http://www.eurekalert.org   Dinosaurs: http://www.micro.utexas.edu/courses/mcmurry/spring98/21/justin.html  \n", "evaluation_span": [0, 5146], "labels": []}
{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian lawmakers on Friday overwhelmingly approved the Soviet anthem as Russia's national hymn _ a move praised by some as a gesture of reconciliation and denounced by others as a symbolic approval of the nation's totalitarian past.   The State Duma, or lower house of parliament, voted 381-51 to approve the bill, which was strongly backed by President Vladimir Putin. The move restored the old anthem's music by composer Alexander Alexandrov but not the original text that included praise for Communist leaders Vladimir Lenin and Josef Stalin.   By the same strong majority, the Duma approved legislation formally endorsing the country's current white-red-and-blue flag as Russia's official flag. That legislation also brings back the Soviet-era red banner as the military's flag and retains the Czarist double-headed eagle as the state emblem.   Putin has said the mixture of old Russian and Soviet symbols would mend bitter rifts in society by paying tribute to the positive heritage of both periods. He referred to opinion polls showing that most people prefer Alexandrov's music to a melody by 19th-century composer Mikhail Glinka, which has been Russia's anthem since the 1991 Soviet collapse.   Liberal politicians and many leading cultural figures have strongly opposed the reinstatement of the Soviet anthem, saying it symbolized political repression.   ``We strongly protest against the Stalinist anthem, which is stained by the blood of millions of victims,'' said Grigory Yavlinsky, the head of the liberal Yabloko faction.   Yabloko and another liberal faction, the Union of Right Forces, said they might appeal Friday's vote in the Constitutional Court. The Duma usually hears speeches by faction leaders before a vote, but this time lawmakers skipped the debate _ a move the liberals described as a procedural violation.   ``For the first time, the opposition was refused the right to speak out,'' Yavlinsky said. ``The presidential administration and Communists were afraid of our arguments against the Soviet anthem.''   Former President Boris Yeltsin has joined other critics of the move to restore the anthem. He said in an interview published Friday in the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda that the solemn music recalls Communist Party congresses, not Soviet sports victories and achievements in space, as Putin had said.   ``I'm categorically against the restoration of the Soviet anthem,'' Yeltsin said.   Communists and other hard-liners had opposed the tricolor flag and the eagle as a vestige of the Czars, forcing Yeltsin to approve them by decree. But they agreed to abandon their criticism and back formal approval for the symbols in response to the reintroduction of the Soviet anthem.   No conclusive version of new lyrics for the old music has been approved yet. The Duma asked Putin to set up a panel to consider the text and submit the final version for its approval.   During Friday's debate, Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov said officials had received an anonymous telephone call saying a bomb had been planted in the building. Lawmakers ignored it and continued their session as police officers with sniffer dogs searched the premises.  \n", "evaluation_span": [0, 3183], "labels": []}

Cycle World brought objective journalism to motorcycle periodicals by offering road tests and a more critical eye than other fan-oriented magazines, said analyst Don Brown of DJB Associates LLC of Irvine.   In its first year, Cycle World became _ and remains _ the largest motorcycle magazine in the world, Brown and others said. It boasts a monthly circulation of 315,000 and its closest rival is the German magazine Das Motorrad.   ``Joe was a true pioneer in our business,'' said current Cycle World publisher Larry Little. ``It was kind of a breaking of a good old boy network of American motorcycles. Joe did not shun the Japanese makers.''   Born in Jonesboro, Ark., on Oct. 20, 1926, Parkhurst moved with his family to California. He served in 1954-56 as a clerk in an Army Reserves office, then took a job as art director of Road & Track magazine in Newport Beach.   He later quit to spend a year traveling in Europe and returned to become art director of Carting World, a go-cart magazine, in 1960. While working, Parkhurst began dreaming of Cycle World.   He thought that Road & Track's consumer approach could serve motorcyclists, said Joe Rusz, a senior editor at Road & Track. Parkhurst also loved riding motorcycles and once told a friend that he ``could never find something worthwhile to read about them,'' Little said.   Parkhurst later merged with another company that owned Road & Track to become Bond/Parkhurst Publishing. He sold both magazines in the early 1970s, said his wife of 22 years.

Now, he does too.   ``There are features that I want and I like,'' said Roelands, a Web developer, who likens it to the battle between VHS and Beta video recorders in the 1980s. ``But the reality is if I use the better product, I get less functionality.''   For this reason, instant messaging rivals like Microsoft, AT&AMP;T and ExciteAtHome maintain their users ought to be able to send messages to anyone else, regardless of what service they happen to have. That's not currently possible.   The companies are lobbying the Federal Communications Commission to require AOL to make its product compatible with those offered by competitors as a condition of its merger with Time Warner.   So far, the agency appears to favor a more tailored approach. The commission's staff has recommended that AOL be required to make its system work with at least one other provider, but the requirement would apply only to advanced instant messaging services offered over Time Warner's cable lines.   How the agency defines advanced services is unclear. They could refer to features beyond text messaging, such as video teleconferencing, the sharing of files or messaging over interactive television.   Today, consumers more commonly take advantage of the garden variety functions. They type short real-time phrases to others, allowing them to ``chat'' back-and-forth using text. Unlike e-mail, it's instantaneous and gets the recipient's attention right away.   People can communicate with international friends without the hefty phone bills. And the service has taken hold with those who have hearing or speech disabilities.   Unlike the telephone, people can discreetly interact with others _ or decide not to.   ``It's communications that can be ignored,'' said Jonathan Sacks, a vice president at AOL, which runs the two leading messaging services _ ICQ and AIM _ with 140 million users. ``On the telephone, you can't see when somebody is near the phone. You can't see when it's convenient for them to communicate with you.''   AOL rivals say that if instant messaging is to be as ubiquitous as the phone network, it has to work the same way: People who use different providers must still be able to contact one another. They continue to lobby the FCC, hoping to see the conditions broadened before the agency issues its final decision.   ``It's really important to get this right before innovation is squashed because one company has a monopoly,'' said Jon Englund, vice president of government affairs for ExciteAtHome. ``It's absolutely critical that Internet uses have real choice among competing platforms.''   AOL has said it wants to work toward interoperability, but first needs to protect consumer privacy and security to prevent the kinds of problems that have emerged in the e-mail world, like spamming _ unwanted junk messages.   Company officials disagreed that AOL's market share was keeping out competitors. AOL executives cited a recent study by Media Metrix indicating that the messaging services offered by Yahoo! and Microsoft are the fastest growing in the United States.   Why all the fuss over a free product that anyone, even those who don't subscribe to AOL, can use?   Some pointed to the recent demise of two instant messaging competitors _ iCAST and Tribal Voice _ as evidence that AOL's dominance could prevent choices in the market.   Another concern is that AOL could use its substantial customer base to tack on new advanced services and then charge for them.   Rivals said the ability of various services to work together will become increasingly important in the future. For example, as instant messaging migrates to cell phones or hand-held computer organizers, consumers won't want to have to install multiple services on these devices, said Brian Park, senior product for Yahoo! Communications Services.   ``You can have the best service and the coolest features, but nobody is going to use it if it doesn't communicate with other services,'' Park said.   ___   On the Net:   America Online corporate site: http://corp.aol.com   IMUnified, coalition formed by AT&AMP;T, ExciteAtHome, Microsoft: http://www.imunified.org/  \n", "evaluation_span": [0, 4492], "labels": []}

Times News Service &QC; &LR; &QL;    Swarms of jellyfish consumed so many fish eggs and larvae in the Gulf of Mexico this summer that some scientists are talking about the potential for serious future threats to commercial and recreational fisheries in the northern Gulf.   The jellyfish, a native species and an invading one, appeared in prime spawning areas just as breeding season for many of the Gulf's most important species kicked into high gear.   According to the National Marine Fisheries Service, the number of jellyfish in the Gulf has been rising for at least 13 years. Scientists say the jellyfish are exploiting three major human-induced changes in the environment: thousands of oil rigs and artificial reefs established to attract game fish have greatly increased the breeding habitat for jellyfish, which need a hard surface for spawning; nitrogen pollution from farm runoff and industrial sources feeds plankton blooms, providing extra food for jellyfish; and commercial fishermen take great numbers of menhaden, a soft-finned, bony fish that competes with jellyfish for the plankton.   Dr. Monty Graham, a researcher at the Dauphin Island Sea Lab in Alabama, worries that with all these advantages jellyfish cannot help but multiply at an astonishing rate.   Making matters much worse, he said, is the advent of Phyllorhiza punctata, or Australian spotted jellyfish. The giant species, previously unreported in the Gulf, is a 25-pound bruiser of a jellyfish native to the Pacific.   Some time ago the basketball-size jellyfish established themselves in the Caribbean. This summer, after apparently riding ocean currents north, they concentrated themselves in the passes between the barrier islands that separate the Mississippi Sound from the Gulf of Mexico.   The Australian jellyfish have now mostly died off in the Gulf. But fishery scientists worry that they may already have affected next year's fish populations. And scientists say the animals were spawning prodigiously, broadcasting millions of their own eggs as they ate the eggs and larvae of native species.   Popular sport fish, including redfish, speckled trout, white trout and Spanish mackerel, as well as commercially important species like crabs and menhaden, spawn just outside the barrier islands. This year, their eggs and larvae had to drift with tidal currents through the jellyfish-choked passes to reach the estuaries that serve as nurseries for the baby fish.   ``These things are incredibly efficient at turning the water over, cleaning it of everything in it,'' Graham said. ``We're finding them with 200 fish eggs in their guts.''   The newcomers had a frighteningly effective feeding pattern that involved swimming to the surface, then diving down to the bottom, scouring the water of virtually every living thing smaller than a BB pellet. After flowing through the jellyfish gantlet, scientists said, the water was almost devoid of living things.   ``You really have two problems in terms of commercially important fish,'' said Harriet M. Perry, director of the fisheries section of the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory in Mississippi. ``First the jellies are ingesting the larvae and eggs of these commercially important species, and then the fish larvae must compete with these incredibly efficient jellies for the same food source.''   Perry said she worried that the Phyllorhiza might become permanent residents. Graham said he feared that their offspring might appear in larger numbers next spring.   He noted, though, that the newcomers represented a small threat compared with the monstrous herds of native moon jellyfish still swarming offshore below Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana in a huge swath roughly 100 miles long and 30 miles wide.   It is these jellyfish that worry Dr. Joanne Lyczkowski-Shultz, a larval specialist with the National Marine Fisheries Service.   Lyczkowski-Shultz said the long-term picture might be bleak if the jellyfish populations continued to grow at their current pace. ``It could be totally devastating,'' she said.  \n", "evaluation_span": [0, 4257], "labels": []}
{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "MERGER &QL; By ALEX BERENSON &QC; &LR; &QL; &UR; c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service &QC; &LR; &QL; &UR; &LR; Back in January, when Internet stocks were hot, America Online agreed to buy Time Warner with AOL stock. The deal, if approved by regulators, would leave AOL shareholders with 55 percent of the merged company, even though Time Warner's revenue and cash flow are far greater.    Since then, AOL's stock has fallen by almost a third, destroying most of the premium the company had offered for control of Time Warner. So a Time Warner shareholder might conclude that America Online's chairman, Stephen Case, had bamboozled his Time Warner counterpart, Gerald Levin, into taking AOL's shares at the worst possible time.   ``Short term, anyone objective would say probably Steve got the better part of the deal,'' said Larry Haverty, a senior vice president at State Street Research in Boston and a longtime media investor.   But Haverty, like many other Time Warner shareholders and industry analysts, hardly cares. With the merger likely to be completed later this month, he predicts that the merged company will grow quickly by combining AOL's marketing skills and captive base of online users with Time Warner's huge library of films, magazines and the like and its relationships with major advertisers.   ``The deal strategically and financially makes all the sense in the world,'' Haverty said. ``Five years out, if you're a shareholder in this company, you're going to be a happy camper.''   That view is widely shared. ``Strategically, it makes a lot of sense,'' said Tom Wolzien of Sanford C. Bernstein. ``These companies fill the holes of the other one. They're subscription-advertising combo models. The reality is the pieces are very compatible.''   To be sure, the recent history of big media mergers is hardly comforting for shareholders in either AOL or Time Warner. Disney stumbled badly after it bought Capital Cities/ABC in 1996, and Time Warner stagnated for five years after it was created in 1990 by the merger of Time and Warner. ``Huge deals are really hard to do and create a lot of uncertainty,'' said Roger McNamee of Integral Capital, which sold its 404,000 AOL shares the day the merger was announced.   But if the merged company can overcome that hurdle, it will have big advantages over Disney and other traditional media companies, which are still struggling to figure out how they can profit from the Internet, said Jessica Reif of Merrill Lynch.   ``Given the multiple distribution platforms that they have, it's obviously a very powerful consumer engine,'' Reif said. ``There's a reason that you see Disney and to a lesser extent NBC screaming in Washington.''   John Schreiber, an assistant portfolio manager at Janus Capital, the mutual fund company that is Time Warner's largest shareholder, with more than 120 million shares, said the companies had already begun to demonstrate how they would work together. For example, AOL has pitched Time Warner's magazines to its users, resulting in hundreds of thousands of new subscriptions. And the companies are trying to sell big advertisers on deals that will reach both America Online users and the people who watch Time Warner cable channels and read its magazines, Schreiber said.   ``Once the merger closes, I think you'll see some very powerful cross-promotional deals across all of Time Warner's advertisers,'' he said.   Schreiber also says the risk of cultural clashes between the companies is limited, because the companies disclosed publicly where top executives would stand in the combined company only a few weeks after the merger was announced. So people who feel their responsibilities have been diminished have had months to look for new jobs, and some have already left, he said.   Given the strength he sees in the combined company, Schreiber said the question of whether Levin could have negotiated a better deal with America Online is moot. Shares in cable companies like Comcast have fallen 15 percent or more this year, while big media companies have been flat or up slightly. So ``it's not as if Time Warner shareholders have lost out on a great deal of upside,'' Schreiber said.  \n", "evaluation_span": [0, 4186], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [507, 518], "entity_id": "Q191715", "name": "WarnerMedia", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 1, "span": [819, 832], "entity_id": "Unknown", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 2, "span": [861, 882], "entity_id": "Q2037125", "name": "State Street Corporation", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 3, "span": [886, 892], "entity_id": "Q100", "name": "Boston", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 4, "span": [1576, 1587], "entity_id": "Unknown", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 5, "span": [1591, 1611], "entity_id": "Q7417608", "name": "Sanford Bernstein", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 6, "span": [1882, 1888], "entity_id": "Q7414", "name": "The Walt Disney Company", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 7, "span": [1920, 1938], "entity_id": "Unknown", "name": "UnknownNoMapping", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 8, "span": [2035, 2039], "entity_id": "Q1411739", "name": "Time Inc.", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 9, "span": [2044, 2050], "entity_id": "Q247032", "name": "Warner Communications", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 10, "span": [2127, 2140], "entity_id": "Q7358633", "name": "Roger McNamee", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q18336849"}, {"id": 11, "span": [2144, 2160], "entity_id": "Unknown", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 12, "span": [2448, 2460], "entity_id": "Unknown", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 13, "span": [2464, 2477], "entity_id": "Q334122", "name": "Merrill Lynch", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 14, "span": [2664, 2667], "entity_id": "Q13974", "name": "NBC", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 15, "span": [2681, 2691], "entity_id": "Q61", "name": "Washington, D.C.", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 16, "span": [2697, 2711], "entity_id": "Unknown", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 17, "span": [2747, 2760], "entity_id": "Q1683034", "name": "Janus Capital Group", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 18, "span": [3973, 3980], "entity_id": "Q1113804", "name": "Comcast", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q43229"}]}

Nonsubscribers can purchase one-time rights by calling 888-603-1036 or 888-346-9867.) &QL; &UR; By FRANK BRUNI &QC; &LR; &QL; &UR; c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service &QC; &LR; &QL;    CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. _ Nearly 17 months after he first issued his call for a ``fresh start after a season of cynicism,'' Gov. George W. Bush ended his quest for the presidency Monday on a nearly identical note, pledging to purge Washington of what he cast as a crippling discord.   The course that Bush charted over his final hours on the campaign trail, plotted with as much concern for symbolism as for raw electoral arithmetic, left no doubt about where he placed the blame for that atmosphere. His first major rally was in Tennessee and his last was planned for Arkansas, the home states, respectively, of Vice President Al Gore and President Clinton.   The Texas governor's words made equally clear that he saw himself as the country's best hope for bridging ideological divides, healing partisan wounds and making sure that Americans could gaze upon the White House with unfettered respect.   ``There's a better day ahead if we have a leader who's willing to unite the country, to bring people together, to elevate the people's business above everyday politics,'' Bush said at a rally inside a hangar at the airport here, where supporters' chants evoked the nearness of the moment of decision.   ``One more day!'' they roared. ``One more day!''   What the nation needed, Bush told them, was ``a president who can unite this nation, a president who puts aside the endless partisan bickering that seems to gridlock our nation's capitol, a president who puts the people first, a president who lifts this nation's spirits.   ``I'll be that president,'' he added, a sentence that was equal parts promise and prediction. It underscored the optimism that Bush has, from the very beginning, sought to project to voters.   His schedule over the course of a 16-hour day was also an expression of that confidence.   In between Tennessee and Arkansas, his campaign plane touched down in Wisconsin and Iowa, and while any one of those four states could wind up providing the key to a Bush victory, none have as many electoral votes as such battlegrounds as Michigan and Pennsylvania.   But they are genuine tossups that were initially predicted to be much more hospitable to Gore. By visiting them Monday, Bush emphasized the breadth of his appeal and the sometimes surprising vulnerability of the vice president.   He did not let his assertion of strength and confidence distract him from the important business of beseeching supporters to grant him victory. With just 24 hours before Election Day, Bush in many ways stripped campaigning to its essence: coaxing and cajoling, pleading and persuading.   ``I want you to understand that I can't win without you,'' Bush told a crowd of more than 1,000 people at a convention center in Green Bay, Wis. ``I hope you redouble your efforts to make sure people get out to the polls.''   Minutes later, he added: ``When you go out there and tell the folks where we stand on the issues and where we stand when it comes to bringing people together to get things done, and you tell them that the core of this campaign is the inherent trust in the American people, I believe it doesn't matter what political party they're in. They're going to come our way.''   In Chattanooga, Bush repeatedly needled Gore, which was much of the point of going to Tennessee, where Gore is not at all certain to prevail on Tuesday.   The Texas governor claimed that Gore's decades of experience in Washington had estranged him from the rest of the country by making him too trusting of federal government and too fond of federal spending.   ``My opponent vows to carry his home state,'' Bush said. ``He may win Washington, D.C., but he's not going to win Tennessee.   ``He forgot his roots,'' Bush added. ``He forgot where he's from. He trusts Washington. We trust the people.''  \n", "evaluation_span": [0, 4108], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [316, 327], "entity_id": "Q186702", "name": "Chattanooga", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 1, "span": [329, 334], "entity_id": "Q1509", "name": "Tennessee", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 2, "span": [543, 553], "entity_id": "Q61", "name": "Washington, D.C.", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 3, "span": [880, 888], "entity_id": "Q1612", "name": "Arkansas", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 4, "span": [1174, 1185], "entity_id": "Q35525", "name": "White House", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 5, "span": [2195, 2204], "entity_id": "Q1537", "name": "Wisconsin", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 6, "span": [2209, 2213], "entity_id": "Q1546", "name": "Iowa", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 7, "span": [2364, 2372], "entity_id": "Q1166", "name": "Michigan", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 8, "span": [2377, 2389], "entity_id": "Q1400", "name": "Pennsylvania", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 9, "span": [3040, 3049], "entity_id": "Q47430", "name": "Green Bay", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 10, "span": [3950, 3954], "entity_id": "Q61", "name": "Washington, D.C.", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}]}
{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "&UR; By JAMES DAO &LR; &QC; &QL; &UR; c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service &LR; &QC; &QL;    WASHINGTON _ Ralph Nader may not be feeling any regrets about his Green Party presidential campaign, but some visitors to the chat room on Nader2000.org, Nader's official campaign website, sounded as if a bad hangover had come crashing down on them.   There was this entry, for instance, posted Thursday morning by a writer named ``wreckz'':   ``I, too, feel I should apologize to America. I was duped. Ralph Nader's enjoyment of all of this is an indication of a man more concerned with vindictive politics than the future of our country and planet. I am no longer a member of the Green Party. Instead, I'm a member of the green movement _ a movement without Ralph Nader.''   Or this one, also posted Thursday morning, from ``Noni'':   ``I saw an interview with Ralph Nader today and he seemed to be enjoying what has happened! I've never seen him smile so broadly. I regret my support. Nader, you're a well-intending man and I agree with most of your positions. But the symbolic run for the White House has destroyed our Party and our cause. Very bad things are in our future. You should not be smiling. And we, the misled, should feel shame for what we've done.''   The remarks expressed fears that votes for Nader may have put Gov. George W. Bush in a position to defeat Vice President Al Gore. In Florida, where Gore trailed Bush by only a few hundred votes Thursday, a shift of just a fraction of Nader's 95,000 votes could have given the state, and the White House, to Gore, the most likely major-party alternative for Nader's supporters.   John Ruth, for example, wrote on the Nader2000 site Thursday morning that he voted for Nader because he thought they ``shared a common goal'' but that he was now regretting it.   `` Gore (despite what you have said) is NOT an environmental clone of G.W. Bush. Because of your actions and statements prior to Nov. 7th, we are on the brink of a Bush presidency. No money, no support, no respect for you, Ralph, ever again!''   And in Oregon, a state that was still too close to call Thursday afternoon, Nader won about 5 percent of the vote _ enough to cause some Nader voters to feel morning-after qualms.   Julie Quastler, 28, who voted for Nader in Portland, said on Wednesday that she was feeling ``a little alarmed and disappointed'' that Bush seemed on the brink of winning the presidency _ suggesting that she did not accept Nader's assertion that the two parties were equally bad.   ``I'm just so sad,'' she said. ``Bush is probably going to be our president and Nader didn't get his 5 percent. It seems like a lose-lose end result in some ways.'' Winning 5 percent of the vote nationwide would have qualified the Green Party for millions of dollars in federal campaign funds in 2004.   But Quastler, the development director for a nonprofit cafe, said she did not feel guilty about her vote.   ``I voted for Nader because he was most aligned with my values,'' she said.   Of course, there were also countless verbal high-fives among Nader supporters Thursday who felt the Green Party had sent a bracing wake-up call to the two major parties.   ``Stand tall and proud, fellow Nader supporters,'' said one message on the Nader2000 site signed GO LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR SCAPEGOATS.   ``We fought the good fight for what we believed in. This does not make us villains.''   Such sentiments seemed particularly strong in Florida. Dorothy Byrne, a state coordinator for the Florida Green Party, said she had been inundated with angry phone calls and e-mails from Democrats, but has yet to receive one regretful note from a Nader voter.   ``I can see positives for the Greens with either Bush or Gore being president,'' she said. ``If Gore was in, we wouldn't have to worry about women's reproductive rights. But his record on the environment is so abysmal I don't see how Bush can be any worse.''   Barbara Lange, the Everglades chairwoman for the Florida chapter of the Sierra Club, said she and other environmentalists voted for Nader because Gore had not taken a stand against the development of a commercial airport near the Everglades.   ``I voted my conscience,'' she said. ``And I'm okay with that.''   Patricia Newell, an organizer for Nader at the University of Florida in Gainesville, said that Nader had won far fewer votes in Florida than his supporters had expected _ due, she said, to ``scare tactics'' by the Democrats.   ``Anyone who voted with Nader on Tuesday knew exactly what they were doing,'' she said. ``On the contrary to feeling guilty, they feel very good about sticking with the candidate that they felt was best.''  \n", "evaluation_span": [0, 4676], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [87, 97], "entity_id": "Q61", "name": "Washington, D.C.", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 1, "span": [100, 111], "entity_id": "Q193156", "name": "Ralph Nader", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q18336849"}, {"id": 2, "span": [468, 475], "entity_id": "Q30", "name": "United States of America", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 3, "span": [814, 818], "entity_id": "Unknown", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 4, "span": [1080, 1091], "entity_id": "Q35525", "name": "White House", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 5, "span": [1389, 1396], "entity_id": "Q812", "name": "Florida", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 6, "span": [1635, 1644], "entity_id": "Unknown", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 7, "span": [2067, 2073], "entity_id": "Q824", "name": "Oregon", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 8, "span": [2242, 2256], "entity_id": "Unknown", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 9, "span": [2285, 2293], "entity_id": "Q182972", "name": "Portland", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 10, "span": [3462, 3475], "entity_id": "Unknown", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 11, "span": [3513, 3524], "entity_id": "Q5603002", "name": "Green Party of Florida", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 12, "span": [3930, 3943], "entity_id": "Unknown", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 13, "span": [4002, 4013], "entity_id": "Q508775", "name": "Sierra Club", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 14, "span": [4241, 4256], "entity_id": "Unknown", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 15, "span": [4288, 4309], "entity_id": "Q501758", "name": "University of Florida", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 16, "span": [4313, 4324], "entity_id": "Q487999", "name": "Gainesville", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}]}

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "ECONOMISTS &LR; &QL; &UR; By MARK LANDLER &LR; &QC; &QL; &UR; c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service &LR; &QC; &QL;    HONG KONG _ For most of this year, Asia's economies have performed a sort of levitating act _ growing by double-digit rates month after month even as economists predicted they would fall to earth.   That dichotomy was on vivid display here Friday: Hong Kong reported that its economic output surged 10.4 percent in the third quarter, and it raised its projection for full-year growth to 10 percent from 8.5 percent.   Yet a block away, the International Monetary Fund warned in a news conference that Asian economies could be hit hard by soaring oil prices and turmoil in the financial markets. The IMF said a $5 increase in the price of a barrel of oil could slow the growth rates of Asian countries next year.   ``The prospects for growth in 2001 have weakened,'' said David Robinson, assistant director of research at the fund. ``There has also been increased political instability across the world, not least in Asia.''   Several Asian countries _ notably the Philippines, Taiwan, and Indonesia _ have been gripped by political tumult in recent weeks. The Philippines president, Joseph Estrada, was impeached last week, while Chen Shui-bian, the president of Taiwan, is trying to fend off a recall vote.   Even in more stable countries, like Malaysia and South Korea, Robinson said the Fund was concerned by the haphazard pace of economic reforms. In many countries, the banks and corporations remain financially shaky.   ``We're still seeing chaebols in deep trouble,'' he said, referring to Korea's heavily indebted conglomerates.   But Robinson acknowledged that these weaknesses had not yet been reflected in the economic performance of the countries. On Tuesday, South Korea reported a 9.2 percent increase in its third-quarter output _ beating the estimates of most analysts and extending a string of powerful quarters.   Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore have also beaten expectations, while Hong Kong's growth rate was nearly three percentage points above a median forecast of 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.   Like other Asian economies, Hong Kong has been buoyed by an unquenchable appetite for its exports, principally in the United States. Exports surged 17.7 percent in the third quarter. Hong Kong has done a particularly booming business in repackaging and shipping goods from mainland China.   Consumer spending rose by a much less impressive 5.6 percent, as retail sales slackened from the second quarter. And consumer prices fell 2 percent, extending a decline that began during the crisis.   Ian Perkin, chief economist at the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce said the double-digit growth in Hong Kong and other Asian countries masked their underlying condition. While the region's growth in exports has been torrid, domestic demand has remained tenuous.   ``We haven't built up our domestic economies yet,'' he said. ``The recovery has relied almost completely on export growth.   ``If consumer spending slows down in the States, it will have a devastating effect on Asia,'' said Perkin. ``2001 could be a crunch year.''   Robinson of the IMF was similarly wary about next year. In October, the IMF projected that the world economy would grow 4.2 percent in 2001, while Asia as a region would grow 6.6 percent. On Friday, Robinson said the growth rate could be lower, though he would not say by how much.   A principal culprit of possibly slower growth is the dependence of many Asian countries on imported oil. Oil prices have risen $5 per barrel since the IMF issued its semi-annual economic outlook in October.   Asia has little control over oil, but Robinson said the region could improve its economic prospects by calming its political waters.   One bright spot in the Asian landscape is China, which is on track to record 8 percent growth in 2000. Robinson said the main question facing Chinese leaders was whether they need to spend billions of dollars in public funds to further stimulate an economy that was already expanding.   Like Perkin, Robinson said Asia's future depended in large part on the health of the United States. But he disputed those who predict dramatically slowing growth _ the so-called hard landing _ for the American economy.   ``The chances of that happening are less than 40 percent,'' he said, ``substantially less.''  \n", "evaluation_span": [0, 4405], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [111, 120], "entity_id": "Q8646", "name": "Hong Kong", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 1, "span": [146, 150], "entity_id": "Q48", "name": "Asia", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 2, "span": [551, 578], "entity_id": "Q7804", "name": "International Monetary Fund", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 3, "span": [882, 896], "entity_id": "Unknown", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 4, "span": [1075, 1086], "entity_id": "Q928", "name": "Philippines", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 5, "span": [1088, 1094], "entity_id": "Q865", "name": "Taiwan", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 6, "span": [1100, 1109], "entity_id": "Q252", "name": "Indonesia", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 7, "span": [1241, 1255], "entity_id": "Q22368", "name": "Chen Shui-bian", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q18336849"}, {"id": 8, "span": [1357, 1365], "entity_id": "Q833", "name": "Malaysia", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 9, "span": [1370, 1381], "entity_id": "Q884", "name": "South Korea", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 10, "span": [1968, 1977], "entity_id": "Q334", "name": "Singapore", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 11, "span": [2127, 2141], "entity_id": "Q13975", "name": "Bloomberg Television", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 12, "span": [2263, 2276], "entity_id": "Q30", "name": "United States of America", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 13, "span": [2427, 2432], "entity_id": "Q148", "name": "People's Republic of China", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 14, "span": [2637, 2647], "entity_id": "Unknown", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 15, "span": [2672, 2709], "entity_id": "Q282592", "name": "Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q43229"}]}
{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "&UR; c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service &LR; &QC; &QL;    GROSSE POINTE PARK, Mich. _ It is deer hunting season in Michigan, and hunters who climb trees with loaded shotguns have state officials redoubling safety education efforts.   Two men have been killed, and a third has been injured since the hunting season opened on Nov. 15. All three accidents involved shotguns, elevated platforms and a practice relatively new to Michigan hunters _ shooting at deer from trees. The Michigan season, one of the busiest, continues through Nov. 30.   Firearm hunting from elevated platforms has long been legal in other states with heavy hunting, like New York and Pennsylvania. But the practice is only in its third season in Michigan, and officials say it appears that hunters still have a lot to learn about safety. Lt. Suzanne Koppelo, hunter safety administrator of the law enforcement division of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources &UR; , &LR; said that since firearm platform hunting began in Michigan there had been seven shooting accidents linked to the practice. Three were fatal. Two hunters shot themselves on platforms and another was killed on the ground by a hunter shooting from a platform. ``If hunters exercised the kind of caution one would expect at heights of 20-some feet, it would be almost a nonissue,'' said Koppelo. ``But given human nature, that's not the case.''   More than 750,000 licensed hunters are taking to the Michigan woods this year, where they are expected to kill about 500,000 of the state's 1.9 million deer. The numbers reinforce the need to improve education about platform hunting with firearms, Koppelo said.   The practice is more commonly associated with hunters using bows and arrows. Instead of hiding on the ground or walking through the woods, they wait quietly, typically at a height of 15 to 20 feet, and fire down at deer that wander below.   Despite the hunter killed from the platform, Sgt. Larry D. Sargent, hunter education field coordinator for the law enforcement division, says the practice does offer one safety advantage: errant shots typically thump harmlessly to the ground, rather than whistling through the woods and striking other people.   The problems primarily arise when hunters get in and out of position.   ``It's kind of hard climbing a tree with a gun,'' Rob Williams said, as he and a hunting partner, Art Bush, waited on a recent morning in a conventional earthbound hunting blind about 20 miles west of Detroit.   For Williams, Rule No. 1 is not to climb a tree with a loaded gun. He says that when he hunts from a platform he climbs up with a rope dangling from his belt to his gun, which he leaves unloaded on the ground. When he is secure in his stand, he pulls his gun up after him and loads it. Sargent says this is proper procedure.   One accident this year, however, illustrates the importance of following each step of the safety procedures. A 16-year-old hunter used a haul line, but it was tied to the trigger guard and he left the gun loaded, Koppelo said. The teen-ager's gun went off and he was shot in the foot.   Others are hurt falling out of trees. Koppelo said that state officials were trying to keep count of these injuries but that it was difficult, since they relied on hunters reporting minor accidents.   ``A lot of guys are embarrassed,'' Sargent said. ``They'll say they fell working in the yard or something.''   Others, Koppelo says, do not want to report accidents for fear the law will be changed. And she adds that though anecdotal reports show Michigan's large hunting population to be taking slowly to firearm deer hunting from platforms, most expect the practice to catch on as it has in other states.   As Peter Thompson, a 16-year-old hunter, said, ``Usually the deer don't look up.''  \n", "evaluation_span": [0, 3800], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [54, 72], "entity_id": "Q2729533", "name": "Grosse Pointe Park", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 1, "span": [74, 79], "entity_id": "Q1166", "name": "Michigan", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 2, "span": [639, 647], "entity_id": "Q22654", "name": "New York", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 3, "span": [652, 664], "entity_id": "Q1400", "name": "Pennsylvania", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 4, "span": [903, 934], "entity_id": "Q6837532", "name": "Michigan Department of Natural Resources", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 5, "span": [2329, 2341], "entity_id": "Unknown", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 6, "span": [2480, 2487], "entity_id": "Q12439", "name": "Detroit", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 7, "span": [3718, 3732], "entity_id": "Unknown", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "OTHER"}]}

Times News Service &LR; &QC; &QL;    TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Lawyers for Vice President Al Gore said Wednesday their only chance for victory in his contest of the Florida election would be shattered if they have to wait until Saturday to begin counting disputed ballots, and they began an appeal to the Florida Supreme Court to do the counting itself, immediately.   The appeal was filed with the District Court of Appeal late Wednesday afternoon, and will be submitted to the state's highest court early Thursday, Gore's lawyers said. It essentially asks the Supreme Court to take over Gore's contest lawsuit from the slow-moving trial court, to count the ballots itself, and eventually to declare Gore the winner if he wins the recount.   But lawyers for Gov. George W. Bush said they had no intention of allowing any hand counting to begin without a vigorous legal fight. To that end, they persuaded Circuit Judge N. Sanders Sauls to order 1.1 million ballots _ every vote cast in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties _ brought up from south Florida and placed in the court's custody.   That represents 83 times the number of disputed ballots that the judge had agreed on Tuesday to transport to Tallahassee at the Gore team's request. And it could take weeks if not months to count them all, the point that Barry Richard, Bush's chief trial lawyer here, said he was trying to make in requesting that the ballots be transported here.   ``We did it to make a point,'' Richard said in an interview. ``If you recount any ballots, you have to recount all of them. Now, we don't think any ballots should be counted, because the manual recount of ballots is finished. But in the event the court determines that some ballots should be counted, we wanted them here so they could all be counted.''   Aware that they could not stop the movement of all the ballots, Gore's lawyers barely objected to the move, asking only that the disputed ballots that might contain hidden Gore votes be separated from the mass.   ``I know when it's futile,'' said David Boies, Gore's chief trial lawyer, to Sauls.   Nonetheless, Gore's lawyers were furious at the move, aware that it represents yet another enormous barrier to their hopes for an immediate count of the 14,000 disputed ballots in the two counties and a quick decision from the judge that Gore really won the election. Even if the Florida Supreme Court should swiftly agree to their request and orders the counting to begin by Friday, that would still put them three days behind their original timetable. And facing a Dec. 12 deadline for the state to name electors for the Electoral College, Gore has absolutely no days to spare.   ``It's a stunt,'' said Kendall Coffey, one of Gore's election lawyers, as he stormed out of Sauls' courtroom Wednesday, referring to the request for all the ballots. ``They're trying to bog down the case, the system, the clerk's office and everywhere else they can.''   The decision by Gore's lawyers to appeal the case shows how perilous their situation is. By appealing, the lawyers were forced to put on paper their fear that their case could be over if they cannot begin counting ballots until Saturday.   The decision to wait until a Saturday hearing ``is effectively a final order denying all relief sought by plaintiffs because the action now pending below must be completed before Dec. 12, 2000, in order to offer any relief,'' said the notice filed with the Court of Appeal. It adds, ``the court must allow sufficient time to complete an accurate and fair count of the contested ballots, which is essential for the proper resolution of the contest action.''   But the decision to bring up all the ballots means that they will not be assembled in Tallahassee until late Friday, a day later than planned. And even then, the hurdles are enormous. There will have to be another hearing before the Florida Supreme Court, and Gore's lawyers will have to refute three arguments to be raised by the Bush team: There should be no more counting at all; if there is any counting, it will have to include all 1.16 million ballots; and if there is any counting of disputed ballots, dimples cannot be counted as votes.   If these issues are heard before Sanders, there will have to be briefs, witnesses, and evidence on each point, which could take days. If the Supreme Court agrees to short-circuit the process, there will still have to be lengthy briefs filed, and the court may need to wait several days before finding time for yet another momentous hearing in its schedule.  \n", "evaluation_span": [0, 4829], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [322, 333], "entity_id": "Q37043", "name": "Tallahassee", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 1, "span": [335, 339], "entity_id": "Q812", "name": "Florida", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 2, "span": [592, 605], "entity_id": "Q3001105", "name": "Supreme Court of Florida", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 3, "span": [678, 702], "entity_id": "Q5461329", "name": "Florida District Courts of Appeal", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 4, "span": [1590, 1603], "entity_id": "Unknown", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 5, "span": [2895, 2912], "entity_id": "Q47586", "name": "United States Electoral College", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 6, "span": [2977, 2991], "entity_id": "Unknown", "name": "Unknown", "parent": null, "children": [], "optional": false, "type": "OTHER"}]}

Times News Service &QC; &LR; &QL;    Booking Your Ticket:   _ Fly nonstop. The fewer connections you make, the lower the chance that you will suffer a delay.   _ Pick airports with care. If you have to connect, choose the least-congested airport possible; some airports, like Chicago O'Hare and La Guardia in New York, experience chronic delays. Take into consideration the weather and the season; an airport in the South might have fewer winter snowstorms but more spring and summer thunderstorms.   _ Check times between connecting flights. Airlines often book tight connections and do not take responsibility if you miss yours. Assume each leg of your flight will arrive late, and book connections that allow ample time.   _ Check on-time records. The Transportation Department requires major domestic airlines to make the on-time record for every flight available to consumers. You can check online at www.dot.gov/airconsumer. That site also reports each airline's on-time record for the previous month.   _ Travel on off-peak days and at off-peak times. Saturday is usually the least-traveled day of the week; so are major holidays. Monday mornings and Friday afternoons are peak travel times for business travelers. Flights leaving earlier in the day are less likely to be delayed, because of the cascading effect that disruptions have on airline schedules.   _ Use smaller airports. Instead of Los Angeles International, for example, consider flying into Burbank or John Wayne Airport in Orange County, Calif., or use Westchester County Airport instead of JFK in New York.   _ Avoid electronic tickets. Though they are convenient and more secure than an easily lost paper ticket, they are not transferable between most airlines if you need to switch carriers because of delays.   _ Watch for labor disruptions. Check newspapers and Web sites like www.thenewfoundlandgroup.com to identify airlines experiencing labor strife, which often increases cancellations and delays.   _ Leave a number. Make sure the airline you book with has a phone number at which you can be notified of delays or cancellations.   _ Use a travel agent. A good one can be a great ally in the event of a problem _ and may save you time and money.   Day of Departure:   _ Be informed. Check your flight's status before heading to the airport. Automated telephone services or airline Web sites often provide more up-to-date information than do ticket agents. The Federal Aviation Administration's Web site, www.fly.faa.gov, has real-time information on operations at the biggest airports.   _ Pack defensively. Take along a change of clothes and a toothbrush in your carry-on bag. If traveling with an infant, take 24 hours' worth of diapers and extra formula. When possible, avoid checking luggage, in case you need to switch flights or carriers. Ship your gifts ahead.   _ Educate yourself. Find out what your airline promises to do for passengers in the event of a delay. Print out a copy of the policy from the airline's Web site, and carry it with you _ in case the airline representatives need a reminder.   If a Flight Is Delayed:   _ Keep your cool. Becoming angry at airline personnel is counterproductive. Sympathy for their plight will sometimes produce results.   _ Don't stand in line. To get on another flight, it is often more effective to call the airline from the airport than to wait at the ticket counter. Carry a cell phone; if delays are widespread, public telephones may be in demand.   _ Check the competition. If another airline has seats to your destination, ask your airline to endorse your ticket to the other line.   _ Get what you paid for. If you paid full fare or are a high-mileage frequent flier, let the airline know. Your odds of getting a seat on the next flight out will increase, or the airline might pay for your hotel, if you are delayed overnight.   _ Consider driving. If the last leg of your flight is a 200-mile hop, renting a car might be a better choice than waiting out a delay.   Getting Even:   _ Write a letter. The airlines have pledged to respond to consumer complaints within 60 days. They almost always offer a refund, reimbursement of expenses, a discount on your next ticket _ or all three. Be sure to save the relevant paperwork.   _ Make it a federal case. Send a copy of your letter to Washington. Complaints are charged against each airline in the Transportation Department's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report and serve as a basis for rule making and enforcement action.

A Florida State judge has ordered local election officials to ship thousands of ballots to the state capital. The move comes as the judge decides whether to order a recount of those ballots in the presidential election. NPR's Steve Inski was in the courtroom. Steve, what are the issues that came up in this hearing tonight?   Corey judge N. Sander Sauls is deciding whether to order a recount as you said of those ballots, 9000 or more actually from Miami Dade County that apparently were never counted at all, at least according to the Democrats in the presidential election and about 3300 ballots from Palm Beach County that were considered by local officials but then thrown out, disallowed. Judge Sauls is deciding whether to count those ballots and go through them and perhaps add some votes to Al Gore's final total, which is exactly what the Democrats want. He is not ready to do that yet. He did not agree to the Democratic proposal to begin counting tomorrow morning but he has ordered that the ballots be shipped up. Later this week, Miami Police apparently are going to escort them upto Tallahassee and they will be ready to be counted if the judge decides at a later time to do so.   Now time is a big consideration from here. What's the judge's timetable?   Not as fast as the Democrats would like, not as slowly as Republicans would prefer. He is going to order a major hearing on Saturday to review all the legal and evidentiary issues, look at evidence, perhaps hear from witnesses and after that the judge will decide if there are any ballots to count. It might take another five days or so to do it. Neither side seemed particularly pleased by the timetable but the judge said, well, I am going to make everybody equally unhappy.   Thank you. NPR's Steven Inksi reporting from Tallahassee, Florida. As the battle over votes goes on in Florida, Washington State is in the middle of recounting the votes cast in its very tight US Senate race. Jennifer Nesan reports from member station KPLU in Seattle.   The recount of the votes cast for Democrat Maria Catwell and Republican Senator Slate Gordon is calm and organized. The State's Elections Director Garry Macintosh says the process is about as exciting as watching paint dry.   There are a lot of things about the election's process I think that are fairly complex. This isn't probably one of them.   Catwell leads Republican incumbent Slate Gordon by fewer then 2000 votes. At this point neither of the candidates plan to contest any of the votes. State law requires a recount when the margin of victory is less than one half of 1 percent. The recount is expected to be completed by the end of the week. No statewide recount in Washington has ever changed the initial outcome.

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "Welcome to this hour of VOA News Now. I'm Erin Brumett in Washington. The incredibly close Florida vote count for President is in the state courts and heading for the US Supreme Court at the end of the week. That's virtually unprecedented, as the Federal Courts have tended to stay out of elections, which are the responsibility of the states. Joe O'Grossman is a professor of constitutional law at Baltimore's Johns Hopkins University. He says that in this instance the Supreme Court probably felt the circumstances were such that they had no real alternative but to take the case.   Well, I think they took the case because it seemed like it was such a important issue that it would be kind of unseemly for them to try to reject it out of hand. In fact, I think that Lawrence Tribe, the Harvard Law School Professor who is arguing for Gore tomorrow, is going to ask the court to hold the case, moot and dismiss it. And the Bush campaign has brought the case, but recognizes that the particular issues that they brought to the court last week are really not very relevant anymore. They are going to probably, well, I know what they are going to do. They are going to try to broaden the case to make it a kind of a general referendum on election procedures. So, they are looking for a coronation. And the Gore people at this point just want to get rid of this case, because they think they have a better chance in the Florida courts.   Republicans generally support states' rights. So, does it appear somewhat ironic that they are going to the Supreme Court in this instance?   No, I think first of all the notion that Republicans favor states' rights and Democrats oppose it, is much too simplistic. That's generally true, but it's only true on some issues. And in this case, you could argue that the Bush people are going to the Supreme Court to preserve the right of Florida, to determine its own electors. So, there is a kind of states' rights issue there. But they need, or at least they once thought they needed the Supreme Court to endorse it. So it goes both ways.   What are the justices likely looking for?   Well, I don't know. But I think that - and I think they will be divided, I mean I don't think they will be unanimous. Obviously, they would like to be able to achieve some kind of resolution of the case. American election laws are often challenged at the local level and sometimes in the Federal courts, but this is certainly the first time we have had a Supreme Court challenge over presidential election. So, there is a lot of new law here to be made or at least law that hasn't been made yet. It's possible that if the court accepts the invitation of the Bush campaign, at least as it is expressed in the briefs they submitted yesterday, that the court will in the sense, take the entire issue, even - not just the specific questions that it was asked last week and try to resolve the question. For example, if the court says it is clearly the fact that the legislature of the state of Florida can determine for itself who its electors will be, that will pretty much end the case, because that's what the legislature already plans to do.

At the moment, Shanghai already has 8 foreign capital banks approved to operate RMB business. They are the US's Citibank, Hong Kong's HSBC, Japan's Tokyo Mitsubishi Bank, Japan's Industrial Bank, the Shanghai Branch of the Standard and Chartered Bank, Shanghai's BNP Paris Bank, the Shanghai Branch of Japan's Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and the Shanghai Branch of Japan's Sanwa Bank.  According to regulations, these 8 banks will all move to Pudong soon.   After the policy was formally announced for the Pudong Lujiazui Financial Trade District to allow foreign capital banks to operate RMB business, more than 40 foreign capital banks and financial institutions have submitted applications to establish branches in Pudong.   When selecting locations in Lujiazui, some foreign financial institutions do not mind the real estate prices, but focus more on whether the class of the building is compatible with the standing of the company.  The Franklin Templeton Company, whose headquarters are in California, the US, and has registered capital of 130 billion US dollars all around the world, decided to establish its local China headquarters in Pudong.  The president of the company and the Asian regional president personally surveyed Pudong and decided to choose office locations in the Shanghai Securities Building, which has a floor rate of more than 2700 US dollars per square meter.  Now, the Templeton Company has formally signed a contract, and bought the floor area of the entire 18th floor of the Securities Building.   Currently, foreign-capital banks and financial institutions such as Hong Kong's HSBC, the Shanghai Branch of the Japan Industrial Bank, the Holland Co-operation Bank, Shanghai Branch of the Belgium Credit Bank, etc., have successively settled down in the Lujiazui Financial Trading District.  Soon, a large number of domestic and foreign financial institutions, and large companies will also come to successively settle down, including the finance street which has already formed in the Waitan district, and the Shanghai central commercial district framework that is forming.

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 1st, by reporter Jingcai Wu  The Weir Group of the US recently signed an implementation agreement in Beijing with Jiangsu Province's Electric Power Department to build China's first large-capacity power plant with liquefied natural gas as fuel.   Aixing Dan, director of the International Co-operation Department of the Electric Power Industry Ministry, on this matter, expressed to Xinhua News Agency reporters today that if this power plant is successful, it will be a model for similar plants to be built along coastal regions.   Coal, water, oil, etc., are normally used for traditional electricity generation.  However, using liquefied natural gas as fuel for joint circulatory electricity generation has advantages of higher power generation efficiency and lower total cost, is beneficial to the environment, etc.  According to presentations, with this type of electricity generation method, a single engine with liquefied natural gas as fuel can produce waste gas with temperatures being as high as 500 to 600 degrees centigrade. This gas in turn can heat a boiler for the production of steam to turn a steam turbine which generates electricity.  Because of the efficiency of this construction method, the electricity generated is relatively competitive in price.  At the same time, using natural gas as fuel will also reduce environmental pollution along coastal regions.   The Weir Group, whose headquarters is in the US, is a large, specialized corporation investing in the area of electricity generation.  The installed capacity of electricity it has invested in and developed globally has reached 15 million kilowatts.  Through the contact of the Yizhong Company of the US, the Weir Group and the Jiangsu Electric Power Department reached an initial agreement on a plan to build a joint circulatory electricity generation plant.  This power plant, which will be situated in Rudong, Jiangsu, has an annual generation capacity of 2.4 million kilowatts. The investment amount is 2.4 billion US dollars. The Chinese side holds 30% of the shares while the Weir Group holds 70%.  According to the agreement, the Weir Group will be responsible for the supply of natural gas from the international market for use by the power plant.   Renzu Luo, managing director of the Weir Group, is optimistic over the prospect of using liquefied natural gas as fuel for electricity generation along China's coastal regions.  He holds that according to the experience of Asian energy market development, liquefied natural gas has become the main material of clean fuel used for electricity generation. When the gross national product per capita reached 3000 US dollars in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, etc., environmental protection awareness generally rose, and all began to obviously increase usage of electricity generated by liquefied natural gas.  As the gross national product in China's coastal regions begins to approach this benchmark, it can be said to have had the conditions for electricity generation using natural gas in terms of financial resources.   John Weir, president of the Weir Group who visited China with US Minister Brown and signed this agreement for electricity generation plant construction in Jiangsu, held that now is the best time to develop a project of joint circulatory electricity generation plant with natural gas as fuel in China. Both parties, the US and China, will invest more time, money and resources to make this power plant project a successful model.
