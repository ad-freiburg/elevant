The official, who wished to remain anonymous, told journalists: \"Iran will start accumulating nuclear capability for military purposes from 2005 and will be in a position, within the space of 10 years, to produce nuclear warheads that can be fitted to missiles capable of striking Israel.\"   The official made these statements after Tehran announced today Saturday that it had \"successfully\" completed a new test on the Shahab 3 ground-ground missile with a range of 1300 kilometers.

The official also stressed that Iran regards the \"destruction of Israel as legitimate,\" saying that \"Tehran is embroiled in strategic terrorist activities targeting Israel, especially alongside Palestinian and Lebanese organizations.\"   The official further considered that \"the Shahab missile will not come into operation for two years and that an improved range of 2000 kilometers would only be achieved after this period.\"   Israel's Deputy Defense Minister, Ephraim Sneh, said today Saturday that Israel would \"know how to find a suitable response\" to the Iranian Shahab 3 ground-ground missile with a 1300 kilometer range.   Sneh said on army radio that \"Israel will prepare itself to find a suitable response to this threat,\" without giving any further details.   The Iranian army announced today Saturday that it had \"successfully\" completed a new test on Shahab 3 ground-ground missiles.

According to official sources, the Lebanese authorities contacted the peacekeeping high command and asked it to put an end to infringements by Israel, which is carrying out operations inside Lebanese territory, in particular dumping sand and building slopes.   The source added that if this is confirmed, then such acts constitute a provocation and an infringement of Lebanese sovereignty.   Witnesses said two Israeli bulldozers started work today Tuesday on a slope in the Abbad sector inside Lebanese territory on the border between Lebanon and Israel.   These witnesses told Agence France Presse that an Israeli army patrol equipped with ultra-modern binoculars penetrated a few meters into Lebanese territory but withdrew back to Israeli territory as soon as a peacekeeping patrol arrived.   Families in southern Lebanon visit this area where, according to tradition, the burial site of Sheikh Abbad, who died 500 years ago, is located.  For their part, Israelis also regard the site as a shrine because, according to them, Rabbi Ashi lived there in the 5th century.   The Israeli army had previously carried out operations inside Lebanese territory in the same border region on August 11.   Last Friday, an Israeli bulldozer crossed the wire fence in Wadi Marjayoun near the Israeli village of Matla and spread sand over a length of hundreds of meters and a width of six meters in order to expose the footprints of people crossing the border or tire prints of cars from the Lebanese side. \n", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 1740], "labels": [[[2, 8], "Q3820"], [[15, 18], "Q40464"], [[23, 30], "Q822"], [[140, 146], "Q801"], [[719, 731], "Q342513"], [[1501, 1515], "Q342513"]]}

The presidents met for a working lunch of around 75 minutes.   The American official stressed that what is important in Putin's proposal is that it falls within the \"framework adopted by the United States and Russia to discuss strategic issues from a defensive and offensive point of view.\"   Putin proposed limiting the Russian and American nuclear capabilities by reducing the number of nuclear heads to under 1500 each, a smaller number than that in the Russian-American Start-3 treaty currently being negotiated.  He proposed that the current reduction should be between 2500 to 2000 nuclear heads.   Putin said this reduction would depend on compliance with the Russian-American anti-ABM missile treaty signed in 1972, which the Americans are attempting to amend to set up anti- missile defenses (NMD).   Washington has so far confirmed agreeing to the 2000 to 2500 nuclear warhead ceiling.  The United States has not taken a final position on the NMD system because Clinton, whose term ends in January, is leaving the decision in this matter to his successor.   In response to a question about Republican presidential candidate George Bush Junior's approach to deploying the NMD system, more ambitious than the one proposed by the Clinton administration, the American official said the United States would continue \"complying with the present framework\" in these strategic discussions.   He added \"while this framework does not reflect the basic interests of the United States, we feel it is still a valid approach in our discussions with Russia on this matter.\"   He also said that Clinton raised the issue of the transfer of sensitive Russian technology to Iran, adding \"President Putin has expressed his agreement that these are real threats and is strongly committed to limiting this, but there is still a lot of work to do\" in this area.   Clinton also touched on the matter of American Edmond Bob who is being tried in a closed court in Russia on charges of spying.

The problem arose after Palestinian Mahmood Abu Talib, whose testimony the court has been hearing since Friday, refused to continue answering a question by defense lawyer Richard Keen about the detailed reasons for his having lived in the former Soviet Union for a period of 18 months in the 70s.   The lawyer asked the judges to force Abu Talib to answer the question aimed at demonstrating the witness's \"professional terrorism\" precedents.   46-year-old Abu Talib was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1990 in Sweden for terrorist acts in Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Stockholm between 1985 and 1986. The defense council in the Lockerbie court is attempting to show his involvement in the Lockerbie attack.   Based on Scottish law, followed in this court, if Abu Talib insists on not responding to the question, this is considered to be \"contempt of court\" and means he may be punished in accordance with Scottish law covering such incidents.   The problem is that the judges may not punish Abu Talib unless Sweden hands him over to Scotland after the court case ends to apply the punishment for \"contempt of court.\"   So far, the judges have not asked Abu Talib to answer the defense's question in what appears to be a move to avoid a tricky situation if the witness refuses to answer.   The court president, Ronald Sutherland, who adjourned the session for a short while in an attempt to find a solution to this dilemma, said \"this raises an important question of principle.\"   The two Libyans, Alameen Khalifa Fahima and Abdulbasit al-Maqrahi, are suspected of sending a bomb from Malta which was used to explode the Pan Am plane over the Scottish village of Lockerbie on December 21, 1988 killing 270 people. \n", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 2042], "labels": [[[2, 12], "Q10056"], [[14, 21], "Q102911"], [[30, 33], "Q40464"], [[574, 586], "Q15180"], [[841, 847], "Q34"], [[870, 879], "Q727"], [[881, 891], "Q1748"], [[896, 905], "Q1754"], [[1825, 1847], "Q5729604"], [[1852, 1873], "Q307773"], [[1912, 1917], "Q233"]]}

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "  CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ In his foreign policy debut as Syria's president, Bashar Assad met Sunday with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in talks on Mideast peace and the escalating violence in the Palestinian territories.   Assad, on his first trip abroad since becoming president in July, also dealt with the issue of Iraq in the talks with Mubarak, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Mussa said.   The Syrian leader's visit came on a fourth day of clashes that have raged in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Jerusalem, leaving more than two dozen Palestinians dead.   ``There is complete agreement (between Mubarak and Assad) as to the seriousness of the situation and that the negative repercussions would adversely effect the peace process, which is in itself in a very precarious state,'' Moussa said.   Assad, 35, has focused on domestic issues since his father, Hafez Assad, died in June after 30 years in power. He has taken steps to modernize his nation's bureaucracy and revive its stagnant economy.   ``This was the first meeting of the first visit of President Bashar Assad after the funeral of his father, so it was only normal for the discussions to have a general tone ... in addition to certain specifics of special importance to both countries and the Arab world,'' Moussa said.   The late Syrian president rarely traveled abroad. In his last few years, however, he had sent Bashar, educated as an eye doctor, on foreign trips as part of his grooming to become president.   Prospects appear dim for progress on either the Syrian or Palestinian peace track. The deadlock in Palestinian-Israeli talks is exacerbated by the worst violence in four years. Syria's government-run media said last week that no progress could be expected now because of the U.S. elections and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's precarious situation as leader of a minority government.   Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations broke down in January, with Syria demanding a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau captured by Israel in 1967. Israel insists on waiting to settle borders until it knows what it will gain by returning Golan land.   Assad has made it clear he intends to follow his father's course in any negotiations with Israel.   Mubarak and Assad met after a week when Russia, France, Jordan and Yemen sent planes to Baghdad, challenging U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Iraq is hoping other Arab countries will follow, despite U.S. complaints, easing its isolation.   Moussa said the presidents discussed the situation in Iraq and would return to it Monday. However, he would not comment on whether Syria and Egypt were planning to send planes to Baghdad.   Egypt and Syria are on good terms, but they have had their differences. Hafez Assad's attempts to rally Arab leaders to present a unified front against Israel gained little ground. He derided Egypt for signing a peace treaty with Israel in 1979.  \n", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 2953], "labels": [[[2, 7], "Q85"], [[9, 14], "Q79"], [[16, 18], "Q40469"], [[53, 58], "Q858"], [[110, 119], "Q15618993"], [[317, 321], "Q796"], [[474, 483], "Q36678"], [[485, 495], "Q39760"], [[500, 509], "Q1218"]]}
{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": " MERGER &QL; By ALEX BERENSON &QC; &LR; &QL; &UR; c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service &QC; &LR; &QL; &UR; &LR; Back in January, when Internet stocks were hot, America Online agreed to buy Time Warner with AOL stock. The deal, if approved by regulators, would leave AOL shareholders with 55 percent of the merged company, even though Time Warner's revenue and cash flow are far greater.    Since then, AOL's stock has fallen by almost a third, destroying most of the premium the company had offered for control of Time Warner. So a Time Warner shareholder might conclude that America Online's chairman, Stephen Case, had bamboozled his Time Warner counterpart, Gerald Levin, into taking AOL's shares at the worst possible time.   ``Short term, anyone objective would say probably Steve got the better part of the deal,'' said Larry Haverty, a senior vice president at State Street Research in Boston and a longtime media investor.   But Haverty, like many other Time Warner shareholders and industry analysts, hardly cares. With the merger likely to be completed later this month, he predicts that the merged company will grow quickly by combining AOL's marketing skills and captive base of online users with Time Warner's huge library of films, magazines and the like and its relationships with major advertisers.   ``The deal strategically and financially makes all the sense in the world,'' Haverty said. ``Five years out, if you're a shareholder in this company, you're going to be a happy camper.''   That view is widely shared. ``Strategically, it makes a lot of sense,'' said Tom Wolzien of Sanford C. Bernstein. ``These companies fill the holes of the other one. They're subscription-advertising combo models. The reality is the pieces are very compatible.''   To be sure, the recent history of big media mergers is hardly comforting for shareholders in either AOL or Time Warner. Disney stumbled badly after it bought Capital Cities/ABC in 1996, and Time Warner stagnated for five years after it was created in 1990 by the merger of Time and Warner. ``Huge deals are really hard to do and create a lot of uncertainty,'' said Roger McNamee of Integral Capital, which sold its 404,000 AOL shares the day the merger was announced.   But if the merged company can overcome that hurdle, it will have big advantages over Disney and other traditional media companies, which are still struggling to figure out how they can profit from the Internet, said Jessica Reif of Merrill Lynch.   ``Given the multiple distribution platforms that they have, it's obviously a very powerful consumer engine,'' Reif said. ``There's a reason that you see Disney and to a lesser extent NBC screaming in Washington.''   John Schreiber, an assistant portfolio manager at Janus Capital, the mutual fund company that is Time Warner's largest shareholder, with more than 120 million shares, said the companies had already begun to demonstrate how they would work together. For example, AOL has pitched Time Warner's magazines to its users, resulting in hundreds of thousands of new subscriptions. And the companies are trying to sell big advertisers on deals that will reach both America Online users and the people who watch Time Warner cable channels and read its magazines, Schreiber said.   ``Once the merger closes, I think you'll see some very powerful cross-promotional deals across all of Time Warner's advertisers,'' he said.   Schreiber also says the risk of cultural clashes between the companies is limited, because the companies disclosed publicly where top executives would stand in the combined company only a few weeks after the merger was announced. So people who feel their responsibilities have been diminished have had months to look for new jobs, and some have already left, he said.   Given the strength he sees in the combined company, Schreiber said the question of whether Levin could have negotiated a better deal with America Online is moot. Shares in cable companies like Comcast have fallen 15 percent or more this year, while big media companies have been flat or up slightly. So ``it's not as if Time Warner shareholders have lost out on a great deal of upside,'' Schreiber said.  \n", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 4187], "labels": [[[508, 519], "Q191715"], [[820, 833], "Q342513"], [[862, 883], "Q2037125"], [[887, 893], "Q100"], [[1577, 1588], "Q342513"], [[1592, 1612], "Q7417608"], [[1883, 1889], "Q7414"], [[1921, 1939], "Q2937389"], [[2036, 2040], "Q1411739"], [[2045, 2051], "Q247032"], [[2128, 2141], "Q7358633"], [[2145, 2161], "Q342513"], [[2449, 2461], "Q342513"], [[2465, 2478], "Q334122"], [[2665, 2668], "Q13974"], [[2682, 2692], "Q61"], [[2698, 2712], "Q342513"], [[2748, 2761], "Q1683034"], [[3974, 3981], "Q1113804"]]}

Times News Service &QC; &LR; &QL;    CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. _ Nearly 17 months after he first issued his call for a ``fresh start after a season of cynicism,'' Gov. George W. Bush ended his quest for the presidency Monday on a nearly identical note, pledging to purge Washington of what he cast as a crippling discord.   The course that Bush charted over his final hours on the campaign trail, plotted with as much concern for symbolism as for raw electoral arithmetic, left no doubt about where he placed the blame for that atmosphere. His first major rally was in Tennessee and his last was planned for Arkansas, the home states, respectively, of Vice President Al Gore and President Clinton.   The Texas governor's words made equally clear that he saw himself as the country's best hope for bridging ideological divides, healing partisan wounds and making sure that Americans could gaze upon the White House with unfettered respect.   ``There's a better day ahead if we have a leader who's willing to unite the country, to bring people together, to elevate the people's business above everyday politics,'' Bush said at a rally inside a hangar at the airport here, where supporters' chants evoked the nearness of the moment of decision.   ``One more day!'' they roared. ``One more day!''   What the nation needed, Bush told them, was ``a president who can unite this nation, a president who puts aside the endless partisan bickering that seems to gridlock our nation's capitol, a president who puts the people first, a president who lifts this nation's spirits.   ``I'll be that president,'' he added, a sentence that was equal parts promise and prediction. It underscored the optimism that Bush has, from the very beginning, sought to project to voters.   His schedule over the course of a 16-hour day was also an expression of that confidence.   In between Tennessee and Arkansas, his campaign plane touched down in Wisconsin and Iowa, and while any one of those four states could wind up providing the key to a Bush victory, none have as many electoral votes as such battlegrounds as Michigan and Pennsylvania.   But they are genuine tossups that were initially predicted to be much more hospitable to Gore. By visiting them Monday, Bush emphasized the breadth of his appeal and the sometimes surprising vulnerability of the vice president.   He did not let his assertion of strength and confidence distract him from the important business of beseeching supporters to grant him victory. With just 24 hours before Election Day, Bush in many ways stripped campaigning to its essence: coaxing and cajoling, pleading and persuading.   ``I want you to understand that I can't win without you,'' Bush told a crowd of more than 1,000 people at a convention center in Green Bay, Wis. ``I hope you redouble your efforts to make sure people get out to the polls.''   Minutes later, he added: ``When you go out there and tell the folks where we stand on the issues and where we stand when it comes to bringing people together to get things done, and you tell them that the core of this campaign is the inherent trust in the American people, I believe it doesn't matter what political party they're in. They're going to come our way.''   In Chattanooga, Bush repeatedly needled Gore, which was much of the point of going to Tennessee, where Gore is not at all certain to prevail on Tuesday.   The Texas governor claimed that Gore's decades of experience in Washington had estranged him from the rest of the country by making him too trusting of federal government and too fond of federal spending.   ``My opponent vows to carry his home state,'' Bush said. ``He may win Washington, D.C., but he's not going to win Tennessee.   ``He forgot his roots,'' Bush added. ``He forgot where he's from. He trusts Washington. We trust the people.''  \n", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 4109], "labels": [[[317, 328], "Q186702"], [[330, 335], "Q1509"], [[544, 554], "Q61"], [[881, 889], "Q1612"], [[1175, 1186], "Q35525"], [[2196, 2205], "Q1537"], [[2210, 2214], "Q1546"], [[2365, 2373], "Q1166"], [[2378, 2390], "Q1400"], [[3041, 3050], "Q47430"], [[3951, 3955], "Q61"]]}
{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": " &UR; By JAMES DAO &LR; &QC; &QL; &UR; c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service &LR; &QC; &QL;    WASHINGTON _ Ralph Nader may not be feeling any regrets about his Green Party presidential campaign, but some visitors to the chat room on Nader2000.org, Nader's official campaign website, sounded as if a bad hangover had come crashing down on them.   There was this entry, for instance, posted Thursday morning by a writer named ``wreckz'':   ``I, too, feel I should apologize to America. I was duped. Ralph Nader's enjoyment of all of this is an indication of a man more concerned with vindictive politics than the future of our country and planet. I am no longer a member of the Green Party. Instead, I'm a member of the green movement _ a movement without Ralph Nader.''   Or this one, also posted Thursday morning, from ``Noni'':   ``I saw an interview with Ralph Nader today and he seemed to be enjoying what has happened! I've never seen him smile so broadly. I regret my support. Nader, you're a well-intending man and I agree with most of your positions. But the symbolic run for the White House has destroyed our Party and our cause. Very bad things are in our future. You should not be smiling. And we, the misled, should feel shame for what we've done.''   The remarks expressed fears that votes for Nader may have put Gov. George W. Bush in a position to defeat Vice President Al Gore. In Florida, where Gore trailed Bush by only a few hundred votes Thursday, a shift of just a fraction of Nader's 95,000 votes could have given the state, and the White House, to Gore, the most likely major-party alternative for Nader's supporters.   John Ruth, for example, wrote on the Nader2000 site Thursday morning that he voted for Nader because he thought they ``shared a common goal'' but that he was now regretting it.   `` Gore (despite what you have said) is NOT an environmental clone of G.W. Bush. Because of your actions and statements prior to Nov. 7th, we are on the brink of a Bush presidency. No money, no support, no respect for you, Ralph, ever again!''   And in Oregon, a state that was still too close to call Thursday afternoon, Nader won about 5 percent of the vote _ enough to cause some Nader voters to feel morning-after qualms.   Julie Quastler, 28, who voted for Nader in Portland, said on Wednesday that she was feeling ``a little alarmed and disappointed'' that Bush seemed on the brink of winning the presidency _ suggesting that she did not accept Nader's assertion that the two parties were equally bad.   ``I'm just so sad,'' she said. ``Bush is probably going to be our president and Nader didn't get his 5 percent. It seems like a lose-lose end result in some ways.'' Winning 5 percent of the vote nationwide would have qualified the Green Party for millions of dollars in federal campaign funds in 2004.   But Quastler, the development director for a nonprofit cafe, said she did not feel guilty about her vote.   ``I voted for Nader because he was most aligned with my values,'' she said.   Of course, there were also countless verbal high-fives among Nader supporters Thursday who felt the Green Party had sent a bracing wake-up call to the two major parties.   ``Stand tall and proud, fellow Nader supporters,'' said one message on the Nader2000 site signed GO LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR SCAPEGOATS.   ``We fought the good fight for what we believed in. This does not make us villains.''   Such sentiments seemed particularly strong in Florida. Dorothy Byrne, a state coordinator for the Florida Green Party, said she had been inundated with angry phone calls and e-mails from Democrats, but has yet to receive one regretful note from a Nader voter.   ``I can see positives for the Greens with either Bush or Gore being president,'' she said. ``If Gore was in, we wouldn't have to worry about women's reproductive rights. But his record on the environment is so abysmal I don't see how Bush can be any worse.''   Barbara Lange, the Everglades chairwoman for the Florida chapter of the Sierra Club, said she and other environmentalists voted for Nader because Gore had not taken a stand against the development of a commercial airport near the Everglades.   ``I voted my conscience,'' she said. ``And I'm okay with that.''   Patricia Newell, an organizer for Nader at the University of Florida in Gainesville, said that Nader had won far fewer votes in Florida than his supporters had expected _ due, she said, to ``scare tactics'' by the Democrats.   ``Anyone who voted with Nader on Tuesday knew exactly what they were doing,'' she said. ``On the contrary to feeling guilty, they feel very good about sticking with the candidate that they felt was best.''  \n", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 4677], "labels": [[[88, 98], "Q61"], [[101, 112], "Q193156"], [[469, 476], "Q30"], [[815, 819], "Q342513"], [[1081, 1092], "Q35525"], [[1390, 1397], "Q812"], [[1636, 1645], "Q342513"], [[2068, 2074], "Q824"], [[2243, 2257], "Q342513"], [[2286, 2294], "Q6106"], [[3463, 3476], "Q342513"], [[3514, 3525], "Q5603002"], [[3931, 3944], "Q342513"], [[4003, 4014], "Q508775"], [[4242, 4257], "Q342513"], [[4289, 4310], "Q501758"], [[4314, 4325], "Q487999"]]}

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": " ECONOMISTS &LR; &QL; &UR; By MARK LANDLER &LR; &QC; &QL; &UR; c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service &LR; &QC; &QL;    HONG KONG _ For most of this year, Asia's economies have performed a sort of levitating act _ growing by double-digit rates month after month even as economists predicted they would fall to earth.   That dichotomy was on vivid display here Friday: Hong Kong reported that its economic output surged 10.4 percent in the third quarter, and it raised its projection for full-year growth to 10 percent from 8.5 percent.   Yet a block away, the International Monetary Fund warned in a news conference that Asian economies could be hit hard by soaring oil prices and turmoil in the financial markets. The IMF said a $5 increase in the price of a barrel of oil could slow the growth rates of Asian countries next year.   ``The prospects for growth in 2001 have weakened,'' said David Robinson, assistant director of research at the fund. ``There has also been increased political instability across the world, not least in Asia.''   Several Asian countries _ notably the Philippines, Taiwan, and Indonesia _ have been gripped by political tumult in recent weeks. The Philippines president, Joseph Estrada, was impeached last week, while Chen Shui-bian, the president of Taiwan, is trying to fend off a recall vote.   Even in more stable countries, like Malaysia and South Korea, Robinson said the Fund was concerned by the haphazard pace of economic reforms. In many countries, the banks and corporations remain financially shaky.   ``We're still seeing chaebols in deep trouble,'' he said, referring to Korea's heavily indebted conglomerates.   But Robinson acknowledged that these weaknesses had not yet been reflected in the economic performance of the countries. On Tuesday, South Korea reported a 9.2 percent increase in its third-quarter output _ beating the estimates of most analysts and extending a string of powerful quarters.   Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore have also beaten expectations, while Hong Kong's growth rate was nearly three percentage points above a median forecast of 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.   Like other Asian economies, Hong Kong has been buoyed by an unquenchable appetite for its exports, principally in the United States. Exports surged 17.7 percent in the third quarter. Hong Kong has done a particularly booming business in repackaging and shipping goods from mainland China.   Consumer spending rose by a much less impressive 5.6 percent, as retail sales slackened from the second quarter. And consumer prices fell 2 percent, extending a decline that began during the crisis.   Ian Perkin, chief economist at the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce said the double-digit growth in Hong Kong and other Asian countries masked their underlying condition. While the region's growth in exports has been torrid, domestic demand has remained tenuous.   ``We haven't built up our domestic economies yet,'' he said. ``The recovery has relied almost completely on export growth.   ``If consumer spending slows down in the States, it will have a devastating effect on Asia,'' said Perkin. ``2001 could be a crunch year.''   Robinson of the IMF was similarly wary about next year. In October, the IMF projected that the world economy would grow 4.2 percent in 2001, while Asia as a region would grow 6.6 percent. On Friday, Robinson said the growth rate could be lower, though he would not say by how much.   A principal culprit of possibly slower growth is the dependence of many Asian countries on imported oil. Oil prices have risen $5 per barrel since the IMF issued its semi-annual economic outlook in October.   Asia has little control over oil, but Robinson said the region could improve its economic prospects by calming its political waters.   One bright spot in the Asian landscape is China, which is on track to record 8 percent growth in 2000. Robinson said the main question facing Chinese leaders was whether they need to spend billions of dollars in public funds to further stimulate an economy that was already expanding.   Like Perkin, Robinson said Asia's future depended in large part on the health of the United States. But he disputed those who predict dramatically slowing growth _ the so-called hard landing _ for the American economy.   ``The chances of that happening are less than 40 percent,'' he said, ``substantially less.''  \n", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 4406], "labels": [[[112, 121], "Q8646"], [[147, 151], "Q48"], [[552, 579], "Q7804"], [[883, 897], "Q342513"], [[1076, 1087], "Q928"], [[1089, 1095], "Q865"], [[1101, 1110], "Q252"], [[1242, 1256], "Q22368"], [[1358, 1366], "Q833"], [[1371, 1382], "Q884"], [[1969, 1978], "Q334"], [[2128, 2142], "Q14270642"], [[2264, 2277], "Q30"], [[2428, 2433], "Q148"], [[2638, 2648], "Q342513"], [[2673, 2710], "Q282592"]]}
{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": " &UR; c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service &LR; &QC; &QL;    GROSSE POINTE PARK, Mich. _ It is deer hunting season in Michigan, and hunters who climb trees with loaded shotguns have state officials redoubling safety education efforts.   Two men have been killed, and a third has been injured since the hunting season opened on Nov. 15. All three accidents involved shotguns, elevated platforms and a practice relatively new to Michigan hunters _ shooting at deer from trees. The Michigan season, one of the busiest, continues through Nov. 30.   Firearm hunting from elevated platforms has long been legal in other states with heavy hunting, like New York and Pennsylvania. But the practice is only in its third season in Michigan, and officials say it appears that hunters still have a lot to learn about safety. Lt. Suzanne Koppelo, hunter safety administrator of the law enforcement division of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources &UR; , &LR; said that since firearm platform hunting began in Michigan there had been seven shooting accidents linked to the practice. Three were fatal. Two hunters shot themselves on platforms and another was killed on the ground by a hunter shooting from a platform. ``If hunters exercised the kind of caution one would expect at heights of 20-some feet, it would be almost a nonissue,'' said Koppelo. ``But given human nature, that's not the case.''   More than 750,000 licensed hunters are taking to the Michigan woods this year, where they are expected to kill about 500,000 of the state's 1.9 million deer. The numbers reinforce the need to improve education about platform hunting with firearms, Koppelo said.   The practice is more commonly associated with hunters using bows and arrows. Instead of hiding on the ground or walking through the woods, they wait quietly, typically at a height of 15 to 20 feet, and fire down at deer that wander below.   Despite the hunter killed from the platform, Sgt. Larry D. Sargent, hunter education field coordinator for the law enforcement division, says the practice does offer one safety advantage: errant shots typically thump harmlessly to the ground, rather than whistling through the woods and striking other people.   The problems primarily arise when hunters get in and out of position.   ``It's kind of hard climbing a tree with a gun,'' Rob Williams said, as he and a hunting partner, Art Bush, waited on a recent morning in a conventional earthbound hunting blind about 20 miles west of Detroit.   For Williams, Rule No. 1 is not to climb a tree with a loaded gun. He says that when he hunts from a platform he climbs up with a rope dangling from his belt to his gun, which he leaves unloaded on the ground. When he is secure in his stand, he pulls his gun up after him and loads it. Sargent says this is proper procedure.   One accident this year, however, illustrates the importance of following each step of the safety procedures. A 16-year-old hunter used a haul line, but it was tied to the trigger guard and he left the gun loaded, Koppelo said. The teen-ager's gun went off and he was shot in the foot.   Others are hurt falling out of trees. Koppelo said that state officials were trying to keep count of these injuries but that it was difficult, since they relied on hunters reporting minor accidents.   ``A lot of guys are embarrassed,'' Sargent said. ``They'll say they fell working in the yard or something.''   Others, Koppelo says, do not want to report accidents for fear the law will be changed. And she adds that though anecdotal reports show Michigan's large hunting population to be taking slowly to firearm deer hunting from platforms, most expect the practice to catch on as it has in other states.   As Peter Thompson, a 16-year-old hunter, said, ``Usually the deer don't look up.''  \n", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 3801], "labels": [[[55, 73], "Q2729533"], [[75, 80], "Q1166"], [[640, 648], "Q22654"], [[653, 665], "Q1400"], [[904, 935], "Q6837532"], [[2330, 2342], "Q342513"], [[2481, 2488], "Q12439"], [[3719, 3733], "Q342513"]]}

Nonsubscribers can purchase one-time rights by calling 888-603-1036 or 888-346-9867.) &QL; &UR; By DAVID FIRESTONE &LR; &QC; &QL; &UR; c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service &LR; &QC; &QL;    TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Lawyers for Vice President Al Gore said Wednesday their only chance for victory in his contest of the Florida election would be shattered if they have to wait until Saturday to begin counting disputed ballots, and they began an appeal to the Florida Supreme Court to do the counting itself, immediately.   The appeal was filed with the District Court of Appeal late Wednesday afternoon, and will be submitted to the state's highest court early Thursday, Gore's lawyers said. It essentially asks the Supreme Court to take over Gore's contest lawsuit from the slow-moving trial court, to count the ballots itself, and eventually to declare Gore the winner if he wins the recount.   But lawyers for Gov. George W. Bush said they had no intention of allowing any hand counting to begin without a vigorous legal fight. To that end, they persuaded Circuit Judge N. Sanders Sauls to order 1.1 million ballots _ every vote cast in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties _ brought up from south Florida and placed in the court's custody.   That represents 83 times the number of disputed ballots that the judge had agreed on Tuesday to transport to Tallahassee at the Gore team's request. And it could take weeks if not months to count them all, the point that Barry Richard, Bush's chief trial lawyer here, said he was trying to make in requesting that the ballots be transported here.   ``We did it to make a point,'' Richard said in an interview. ``If you recount any ballots, you have to recount all of them. Now, we don't think any ballots should be counted, because the manual recount of ballots is finished. But in the event the court determines that some ballots should be counted, we wanted them here so they could all be counted.''   Aware that they could not stop the movement of all the ballots, Gore's lawyers barely objected to the move, asking only that the disputed ballots that might contain hidden Gore votes be separated from the mass.   ``I know when it's futile,'' said David Boies, Gore's chief trial lawyer, to Sauls.   Nonetheless, Gore's lawyers were furious at the move, aware that it represents yet another enormous barrier to their hopes for an immediate count of the 14,000 disputed ballots in the two counties and a quick decision from the judge that Gore really won the election. Even if the Florida Supreme Court should swiftly agree to their request and orders the counting to begin by Friday, that would still put them three days behind their original timetable. And facing a Dec. 12 deadline for the state to name electors for the Electoral College, Gore has absolutely no days to spare.   ``It's a stunt,'' said Kendall Coffey, one of Gore's election lawyers, as he stormed out of Sauls' courtroom Wednesday, referring to the request for all the ballots. ``They're trying to bog down the case, the system, the clerk's office and everywhere else they can.''   The decision by Gore's lawyers to appeal the case shows how perilous their situation is. By appealing, the lawyers were forced to put on paper their fear that their case could be over if they cannot begin counting ballots until Saturday.   The decision to wait until a Saturday hearing ``is effectively a final order denying all relief sought by plaintiffs because the action now pending below must be completed before Dec. 12, 2000, in order to offer any relief,'' said the notice filed with the Court of Appeal. It adds, ``the court must allow sufficient time to complete an accurate and fair count of the contested ballots, which is essential for the proper resolution of the contest action.''   But the decision to bring up all the ballots means that they will not be assembled in Tallahassee until late Friday, a day later than planned. And even then, the hurdles are enormous. There will have to be another hearing before the Florida Supreme Court, and Gore's lawyers will have to refute three arguments to be raised by the Bush team: There should be no more counting at all; if there is any counting, it will have to include all 1.16 million ballots; and if there is any counting of disputed ballots, dimples cannot be counted as votes.   If these issues are heard before Sanders, there will have to be briefs, witnesses, and evidence on each point, which could take days. If the Supreme Court agrees to short-circuit the process, there will still have to be lengthy briefs filed, and the court may need to wait several days before finding time for yet another momentous hearing in its schedule.  \n", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 4830], "labels": [[[323, 334], "Q37043"], [[336, 340], "Q812"], [[593, 606], "Q3001105"], [[679, 703], "Q5461329"], [[1591, 1604], "Q342513"], [[2896, 2913], "Q47586"], [[2978, 2992], "Q342513"]]}

Times News Service &QC; &LR; &QL;    Booking Your Ticket:   _ Fly nonstop. The fewer connections you make, the lower the chance that you will suffer a delay.   _ Pick airports with care. If you have to connect, choose the least-congested airport possible; some airports, like Chicago O'Hare and La Guardia in New York, experience chronic delays. Take into consideration the weather and the season; an airport in the South might have fewer winter snowstorms but more spring and summer thunderstorms.   _ Check times between connecting flights. Airlines often book tight connections and do not take responsibility if you miss yours. Assume each leg of your flight will arrive late, and book connections that allow ample time.   _ Check on-time records. The Transportation Department requires major domestic airlines to make the on-time record for every flight available to consumers. You can check online at www.dot.gov/airconsumer. That site also reports each airline's on-time record for the previous month.   _ Travel on off-peak days and at off-peak times. Saturday is usually the least-traveled day of the week; so are major holidays. Monday mornings and Friday afternoons are peak travel times for business travelers. Flights leaving earlier in the day are less likely to be delayed, because of the cascading effect that disruptions have on airline schedules.   _ Use smaller airports. Instead of Los Angeles International, for example, consider flying into Burbank or John Wayne Airport in Orange County, Calif., or use Westchester County Airport instead of JFK in New York.   _ Avoid electronic tickets. Though they are convenient and more secure than an easily lost paper ticket, they are not transferable between most airlines if you need to switch carriers because of delays.   _ Watch for labor disruptions. Check newspapers and Web sites like www.thenewfoundlandgroup.com to identify airlines experiencing labor strife, which often increases cancellations and delays.   _ Leave a number. Make sure the airline you book with has a phone number at which you can be notified of delays or cancellations.   _ Use a travel agent. A good one can be a great ally in the event of a problem _ and may save you time and money.   Day of Departure:   _ Be informed. Check your flight's status before heading to the airport. Automated telephone services or airline Web sites often provide more up-to-date information than do ticket agents. The Federal Aviation Administration's Web site, www.fly.faa.gov, has real-time information on operations at the biggest airports.   _ Pack defensively. Take along a change of clothes and a toothbrush in your carry-on bag. If traveling with an infant, take 24 hours' worth of diapers and extra formula. When possible, avoid checking luggage, in case you need to switch flights or carriers. Ship your gifts ahead.   _ Educate yourself. Find out what your airline promises to do for passengers in the event of a delay. Print out a copy of the policy from the airline's Web site, and carry it with you _ in case the airline representatives need a reminder.   If a Flight Is Delayed:   _ Keep your cool. Becoming angry at airline personnel is counterproductive. Sympathy for their plight will sometimes produce results.   _ Don't stand in line. To get on another flight, it is often more effective to call the airline from the airport than to wait at the ticket counter. Carry a cell phone; if delays are widespread, public telephones may be in demand.   _ Check the competition. If another airline has seats to your destination, ask your airline to endorse your ticket to the other line.   _ Get what you paid for. If you paid full fare or are a high-mileage frequent flier, let the airline know. Your odds of getting a seat on the next flight out will increase, or the airline might pay for your hotel, if you are delayed overnight.   _ Consider driving. If the last leg of your flight is a 200-mile hop, renting a car might be a better choice than waiting out a delay.   Getting Even:   _ Write a letter. The airlines have pledged to respond to consumer complaints within 60 days. They almost always offer a refund, reimbursement of expenses, a discount on your next ticket _ or all three. Be sure to save the relevant paperwork.   _ Make it a federal case. Send a copy of your letter to Washington. Complaints are charged against each airline in the Transportation Department's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report and serve as a basis for rule making and enforcement action.

A Florida State judge has ordered local election officials to ship thousands of ballots to the state capital. The move comes as the judge decides whether to order a recount of those ballots in the presidential election. NPR's Steve Inski was in the courtroom. Steve, what are the issues that came up in this hearing tonight?   Corey judge N. Sander Sauls is deciding whether to order a recount as you said of those ballots, 9000 or more actually from Miami Dade County that apparently were never counted at all, at least according to the Democrats in the presidential election and about 3300 ballots from Palm Beach County that were considered by local officials but then thrown out, disallowed. Judge Sauls is deciding whether to count those ballots and go through them and perhaps add some votes to Al Gore's final total, which is exactly what the Democrats want. He is not ready to do that yet. He did not agree to the Democratic proposal to begin counting tomorrow morning but he has ordered that the ballots be shipped up. Later this week, Miami Police apparently are going to escort them upto Tallahassee and they will be ready to be counted if the judge decides at a later time to do so.   Now time is a big consideration from here. What's the judge's timetable?   Not as fast as the Democrats would like, not as slowly as Republicans would prefer. He is going to order a major hearing on Saturday to review all the legal and evidentiary issues, look at evidence, perhaps hear from witnesses and after that the judge will decide if there are any ballots to count. It might take another five days or so to do it. Neither side seemed particularly pleased by the timetable but the judge said, well, I am going to make everybody equally unhappy.   Thank you. NPR's Steven Inksi reporting from Tallahassee, Florida. As the battle over votes goes on in Florida, Washington State is in the middle of recounting the votes cast in its very tight US Senate race. Jennifer Nesan reports from member station KPLU in Seattle.   The recount of the votes cast for Democrat Maria Catwell and Republican Senator Slate Gordon is calm and organized. The State's Elections Director Garry Macintosh says the process is about as exciting as watching paint dry.   There are a lot of things about the election's process I think that are fairly complex. This isn't probably one of them.   Catwell leads Republican incumbent Slate Gordon by fewer then 2000 votes. At this point neither of the candidates plan to contest any of the votes. State law requires a recount when the margin of victory is less than one half of 1 percent. The recount is expected to be completed by the end of the week. No statewide recount in Washington has ever changed the initial outcome.

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": " Welcome to this hour of VOA News Now. I'm Erin Brumett in Washington. The incredibly close Florida vote count for President is in the state courts and heading for the US Supreme Court at the end of the week. That's virtually unprecedented, as the Federal Courts have tended to stay out of elections, which are the responsibility of the states. Joe O'Grossman is a professor of constitutional law at Baltimore's Johns Hopkins University. He says that in this instance the Supreme Court probably felt the circumstances were such that they had no real alternative but to take the case.   Well, I think they took the case because it seemed like it was such a important issue that it would be kind of unseemly for them to try to reject it out of hand. In fact, I think that Lawrence Tribe, the Harvard Law School Professor who is arguing for Gore tomorrow, is going to ask the court to hold the case, moot and dismiss it. And the Bush campaign has brought the case, but recognizes that the particular issues that they brought to the court last week are really not very relevant anymore. They are going to probably, well, I know what they are going to do. They are going to try to broaden the case to make it a kind of a general referendum on election procedures. So, they are looking for a coronation. And the Gore people at this point just want to get rid of this case, because they think they have a better chance in the Florida courts.   Republicans generally support states' rights. So, does it appear somewhat ironic that they are going to the Supreme Court in this instance?   No, I think first of all the notion that Republicans favor states' rights and Democrats oppose it, is much too simplistic. That's generally true, but it's only true on some issues. And in this case, you could argue that the Bush people are going to the Supreme Court to preserve the right of Florida, to determine its own electors. So, there is a kind of states' rights issue there. But they need, or at least they once thought they needed the Supreme Court to endorse it. So it goes both ways.   What are the justices likely looking for?   Well, I don't know. But I think that - and I think they will be divided, I mean I don't think they will be unanimous. Obviously, they would like to be able to achieve some kind of resolution of the case. American election laws are often challenged at the local level and sometimes in the Federal courts, but this is certainly the first time we have had a Supreme Court challenge over presidential election. So, there is a lot of new law here to be made or at least law that hasn't been made yet. It's possible that if the court accepts the invitation of the Bush campaign, at least as it is expressed in the briefs they submitted yesterday, that the court will in the sense, take the entire issue, even - not just the specific questions that it was asked last week and try to resolve the question. For example, if the court says it is clearly the fact that the legislature of the state of Florida can determine for itself who its electors will be, that will pretty much end the case, because that's what the legislature already plans to do. And that doesn't mean the Gore people won't keep trying, because ultimately Congress has to decide and only Congress can decide if there are competing slates of electors submitted, which slate to accept.   The Johns Hopkins University constitutional law professor Joe O'Grossman says, it's still not certain the Supreme Court will actually hear the Florida case. As their first order, business Friday, attorneys for Vice President Gore will move to have the court dismiss the case brought by Republican George W Bush.  \n", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 3681], "labels": [[[59, 69], "Q61"], [[171, 184], "Q11201"], [[345, 359], "Q6213502"], [[400, 409], "Q5092"], [[412, 436], "Q193727"], [[770, 784], "Q4994314"], [[838, 842], "Q19673"], [[2981, 2992], "Q3556484"], [[3237, 3245], "Q11268"]]}

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "  Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 1st, by reporter Jingcai Wu  The Weir Group of the US recently signed an implementation agreement in Beijing with Jiangsu Province's Electric Power Department to build China's first large-capacity power plant with liquefied natural gas as fuel.   Aixing Dan, director of the International Co-operation Department of the Electric Power Industry Ministry, on this matter, expressed to Xinhua News Agency reporters today that if this power plant is successful, it will be a model for similar plants to be built along coastal regions.   Coal, water, oil, etc., are normally used for traditional electricity generation.  However, using liquefied natural gas as fuel for joint circulatory electricity generation has advantages of higher power generation efficiency and lower total cost, is beneficial to the environment, etc.  According to presentations, with this type of electricity generation method, a single engine with liquefied natural gas as fuel can produce waste gas with temperatures being as high as 500 to 600 degrees centigrade. This gas in turn can heat a boiler for the production of steam to turn a steam turbine which generates electricity.  Because of the efficiency of this construction method, the electricity generated is relatively competitive in price.  At the same time, using natural gas as fuel will also reduce environmental pollution along coastal regions.   The Weir Group, whose headquarters is in the US, is a large, specialized corporation investing in the area of electricity generation.  The installed capacity of electricity it has invested in and developed globally has reached 15 million kilowatts.  Through the contact of the Yizhong Company of the US, the Weir Group and the Jiangsu Electric Power Department reached an initial agreement on a plan to build a joint circulatory electricity generation plant.  This power plant, which will be situated in Rudong, Jiangsu, has an annual generation capacity of 2.4 million kilowatts. The investment amount is 2.4 billion US dollars. The Chinese side holds 30% of the shares while the Weir Group holds 70%.  According to the agreement, the Weir Group will be responsible for the supply of natural gas from the international market for use by the power plant.   Renzu Luo, managing director of the Weir Group, is optimistic over the prospect of using liquefied natural gas as fuel for electricity generation along China's coastal regions.  He holds that according to the experience of Asian energy market development, liquefied natural gas has become the main material of clean fuel used for electricity generation. When the gross national product per capita reached 3000 US dollars in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, etc., environmental protection awareness generally rose, and all began to obviously increase usage of electricity generated by liquefied natural gas.  As the gross national product in China's coastal regions begins to approach this benchmark, it can be said to have had the conditions for electricity generation using natural gas in terms of financial resources.   John Weir, president of the Weir Group who visited China with US Minister Brown and signed this agreement for electricity generation plant construction in Jiangsu, held that now is the best time to develop a project of joint circulatory electricity generation plant with natural gas as fuel in China. Both parties, the US and China, will invest more time, money and resources to make this power plant project a successful model.
