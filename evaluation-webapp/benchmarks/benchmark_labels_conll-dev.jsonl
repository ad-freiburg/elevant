LONDON 1996-08-30 West Indian all-rounder Phil Simmons took four for 38 on Friday as Leicestershire beat Somerset by an innings and 39 runs in two days to take over at the head of the county championship . Their stay on top , though , may be short-lived as title rivals Essex , Derbyshire and Surrey all closed in on victory while Kent made up for lost time in their rain-affected match against Nottinghamshire . After bowling Somerset out for 83 on the opening morning at Grace Road , Leicestershire extended their first innings by 94 runs before being bowled out for 296 with England discard Andy Caddick taking three for 83 . Trailing by 213 , Somerset got a solid start to their second innings before Simmons stepped in to bundle them out for 174 . Essex , however , look certain to regain their top spot after Nasser Hussain and Peter Such gave them a firm grip on their match against Yorkshire at Headingley . Hussain , considered surplus to England 's one-day requirements , struck 158 , his first championship century of the season , as Essex reached 372 and took a first innings lead of 82 . By the close Yorkshire had turned that into a 37-run advantage but off-spinner Such had scuttled their hopes , taking four for 24 in 48 balls and leaving them hanging on 119 for five and praying for rain . At the Oval , Surrey captain Chris Lewis , another man dumped by England , continued to silence his critics as he followed his four for 45 on Thursday with 80 not out on Friday in the match against Warwickshire . He was well backed by England hopeful Mark Butcher who made 70 as Surrey closed on 429 for seven , a lead of 234 . Derbyshire kept up the hunt for their first championship title since 1936 by reducing Worcestershire to 133 for five in their second innings , still 100 runs away from avoiding an innings defeat . Australian Tom Moody took six for 82 but Chris Adams , 123 , and Tim O'Gorman , 109 , took Derbyshire to 471 and a first innings lead of 233 . After the frustration of seeing the opening day of their match badly affected by the weather , Kent stepped up a gear to dismiss Nottinghamshire for 214 . They were held up by a gritty 84 from Paul Johnson but ex-England fast bowler Martin McCague took four for 55 . By stumps Kent had reached 108 for three .", "links": [], "title_synonyms": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 2350], "labels": [[[10, 24], "Q3229147"], [[66, 72], "Q84"], [[84, 95], "Q912881"], [[108, 120], "Q6827914"], [[151, 165], "Q3229147"], [[171, 179], "Q3489807"], [[336, 341], "Q3058749"], [[344, 354], "Q1788018"], [[359, 365], "Q2725632"], [[397, 401], "Q3195284"], [[461, 476], "Q3344790"], [[493, 501], "Q3489807"], [[539, 549], "Q5591359"], [[552, 566], "Q3229147"], [[644, 651], "Q1321565"], [[660, 672], "Q4756511"], [[713, 721], "Q3489807"], [[771, 778], "Q6827914"], [[819, 824], "Q3058749"], [[881, 895], "Q3520174"], [[900, 910], "Q6836032"], [[956, 965], "Q3177444"], [[969, 979], "Q1592322"], [[982, 989], "Q3520174"], [[1014, 1021], "Q1321565"], [[1111, 1116], "Q3058749"], [[1180, 1189], "Q3177444"], [[1246, 1250], "Q6836032"], [[1380, 1384], "Q1155836"], [[1387, 1393], "Q2725632"], [[1402, 1413], "Q5107238"], [[1438, 1445], "Q1321565"], [[1571, 1583], "Q2725705"], [[1608, 1615], "Q1321565"], [[1624, 1636], "Q6766945"], [[1652, 1658], "Q2725632"], [[1701, 1711], "Q1788018"], [[1787, 1801], "Q2725667"], [[1898, 1908], "Q408"], [[1909, 1918], "Q3537597"], [[1939, 1950], "Q5105685"], [[1963, 1975], "Unknown"], [[1989, 1999], "Q1788018"], [[2136, 2140], "Q3195284"], [[2170, 2185], "Q3344790"], [[2234, 2246], "Q7151607"], [[2251, 2261], "Unknown"], [[2274, 2288], "Q6584108"], [[2318, 2322], "Q3195284"]]}

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "TENNIS - TARANGO , O'BRIEN SPRING TWIN UPSETS UNDER THE LIGHTS . Larry Fine NEW YORK 1996-08-30 Andre Agassi escaped disaster on Thursday but Wimbledon finalist MaliVai Washington and Marcelo Rios were not so fortunate on a night of upsets at the U.S. Open . The 11th-seeded Washington fell short of reprising his Wimbledon miracle comeback as he lost to red-hot wildcard Alex O'Brien 6-3 6-4 5-7 3-6 6-3 in a two hour 51 minute struggle on the Stadium court . Next door on the grandstand , 10th seed Rios lost to another player with a Wimbledon connection -- bad boy Jeff Tarango . The temperamental left-hander defeated the Chilean 6-4 4-6 7-6 6-2 . The day programme went smoothly although sixth-seeded former champion Agassi had to wriggle out of a dangerous 3-6 0-4 hole , winning 18 of the last 19 games against India 's Leander Paes . But the night belonged to the upstarts . Washington , who climbed back from a 1-5 deficit , two sets down in the third set against Todd Martin in the Wimbledon semifinals , looked poised for another sensational comeback . O'Brien , a winner two weeks ago in New Haven for his first pro title , served for the match at 5-4 in the third set before Washington came charging back . \" I just kept saying to myself , ' keep giving yourself the best chance to win , keep battling , maybe something will happen , ' \" said the 26-year-old O'Brien , ranked 65th . \" I kept my composure and I was proud of myself for that -- usually I would have folded up the tent and gone home . \" The hard-serving O'Brien , a former U.S. collegiate national champion , fired up 17 aces to ultimately subdue the never-say-die Washington . The fifth set stayed on serve until the sixth game , when Washington , after saving one break point with a forehand winner down the line , netted a backhand to give O'Brien a 4-2 lead . The Texan blasted in two aces to hold serve at 5-2 and then converted his eighth match point for victory when Washington found the net with another backhand from 40-0 . \" You just kind of keep fighting and you keep trying to make him play a little bit . I think he got a little tight at a couple of moments , \" said Washington . \" But I think he served pretty well when he had to . \" Tarango , whose Wimbledon tantrum two years ago brought him a $ 28,000 fine and suspension from this year 's tournament at the All-England Club , argued calls and taunted fans in his lively two hour , 24 minute tango with Rios on the grandstand . A boisterous cheering section backed the distracted Chilean and booed the lanky American , who ate up all the attention . \" I 'm an emotional player , \" said the 104th-ranked Tarango . \" I think I played very well tonight , very focused . \" The match turned on the third-set tiebreaker , which the American won 7-5 much to the dismay of the spectators . \" I love the crowd if they boo me every day . It fires me up , makes me play my best tennis , \" Tarango said . \" I played some of my best tennis in college when fraternities were throwing beer on me . If tennis was like that every day , I think everybody wold be having a lot more fun . \" Rios did not appreciate Tarango 's antics . \" He 's always complaining too much , \" said Rios . \" But I think it 's not that . I think I played really bad . It was tough to play at night . Balls were going really fast . I lost too many points that I never lose .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "U.S. debt futures end lower , shaken by Chicago NAPM . CHICAGO 1996-08-30 U.S. debt futures finished a shortened pre-holiday session sharply lower , as the markets were shaken by a stronger than expected rise in the August National Association of Purchasing Management ( NAPM ) index for the Chicago area , traders and analysts said . The August Chicago NAPM rose 8.8 points to 60.0 , its highest level since 62.6 in February 1995 and the largest monthly rise since December 1993 . Primary dealers immediately sold Eurodollar and bond futures , after the market on average was expecting the index to rise marginally to 51.9 from July 's 51.2 . Traders also said Japanese investors were unwinding long Eurodollar futures / short swaps , and that heavy put buying helped pressure Eurodollars to lower levels before the close . One U.S. firm bought 35,000 September 97 mid-curve put options at a strike price of 93.25 to 93.30 in the last two sessions , while a French firm bought 4,000 September 93.30 to 93.32 put spreads . \" Even before the data came out , we were seeing put buying , \" one floor trader said . Meanwhile , funds were reportedly good sellers of five-year notes . Rumors circulated that the Federal Reserve was buying five-year notes , and that a renowned hedge fund manager was buying 10-year notes in the cash markets . However , December T-bonds ended below a major trendline level at 106-26/32 , as the yield in the cash bond market set its highest monthly close since April 1995 at 7.12 percent , one analyst said . December bonds blew through the July 30 low of 107-06/32 , even though conditions were slightly oversold , traders said . The December calendar spread continued to widen , also reflecting the market 's fear of rising inflation . While the market continues to price-in higher U.S. interest rates , there was little conviction to the theory that the Federal Reserve would tighten rates before the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on September 24 . Federal Reserve governor Lawrence Lindsey , speaking on U.S. cable television network CNBC , said the U.S. economy appears on balance to be a bit strong , adding the central bank would not curb growth provided inflation remains in check . Earlier in the day , Fed chairman Alan Greenspan said at the annual Jackson Hole symposium that the goal of price stability is within reach for major nations . Traders said the Fed 's decision to adopt a tightening bias at the July FOMC meeting has cast more focus on every piece of U.S. economic news . \" The Fed 's stance has really sensitized us to all this data , \" one analyst said . \" The revisions to GDP , for example , may not have attracted a lot of attention . \" At the end of pit trade , December bonds were off 27/32 at 106-25/32 , 10-year notes down 21/32 at 105-17/32 , munibonds off 17/32 at 111-20/32 , December Eurodollars were down 11 bps at 93.94 , March Eurodollars were off 13 bps at 93.72 and March T-bills were down 12 bps at 94.33 .", "links": [], "title_synonyms": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 2988], "labels": [[[0, 4], "Q30"], [[40, 47], "Q1297"], [[48, 52], "Unknown"], [[55, 62], "Q1297"], [[74, 78], "Q30"], [[223, 268], "Q3152801"], [[271, 275], "Unknown"], [[292, 299], "Q1297"], [[346, 353], "Q1297"], [[354, 358], "Unknown"], [[515, 525], "Q1374984"], [[662, 670], "Q17"], [[701, 711], "Q1374984"], [[778, 789], "Q1374984"], [[829, 833], "Q30"], [[959, 965], "Q142"], [[1206, 1221], "Q53536"], [[1811, 1815], "Q30"], [[1884, 1899], "Q53536"], [[1936, 1965], "Q2289022"], [[1992, 2007], "Q53536"], [[2017, 2033], "Q6503830"], [[2048, 2052], "Q30"], [[2078, 2082], "Q1023912"], [[2094, 2098], "Q30"], [[2252, 2255], "Q53536"], [[2265, 2279], "Q193635"], [[2299, 2321], "Unknown"], [[2408, 2411], "Q53536"], [[2463, 2467], "Q2289022"], [[2514, 2518], "Q30"], [[2541, 2544], "Q53536"], [[2860, 2871], "Q1374984"], [[2906, 2917], "Q1374984"]]}

FARMINGTON HILLS , Mich . 1996-08-30 Shares of Douglas & Lomason Co were up 4-1/2 at 30-5/8 Friday afternoon after Thursday 's announcement that the vehicle seat maker had agreed to be acquired by Magna International Inc for $ 31 a share , or $ 135 million . Magna was up 1/8 to 48-1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange . Douglas & Lomason has 4.45 million common shares outstanding , some of which are option shares to be purchased at exercise prices less than the $ 31 offered price . The acquisition will beef up Markham , Ontario-based Magna 's North American car and truck seating business , allowing it to better compete with Johnson Controls Inc and Lear Corp . Family-controlled Douglas & Lomason , which had 1995 revenue of $ 561 million , was finding it more difficult to compete for new seating contracts from vehicle makers , said James Hoey , chief financial officer . \" Unfortunately , in the auto industry these days , a $ 500 million company is not a big company anymore , \" Hoey said . \" This merger makes us much more competitive . \" He added that Douglas & Lomason 's top executives have been asked to stay on with Magna after the merger , though their future roles have not yet been defined . Douglas & Lomason 's profits were hurt in the past year by model changeovers , which had reduced production at some important customers , but are now recovering , analysts said .

Ford plans to cut its roster of 2,300 tier-one suppliers -- those it deals with directly -- in half over the next five years . \" The deal really levels the seating field somewhat , \" said John Casesa of Schroder Wertheim & Co . \" It should give Magna the critical mass to be a bigger player in that market . \" Magna 's traditional strength has been instrument panels , door panels and other interior components .

The Iraqis claimed they were \" ordinary people persecuted by the regime of Saddam ( Hussein ) \" but interior ministry officials had consistently said it was likely the seven would be charged with hijack before any plea for asylum was considered . Under English law the maximum sentence for hijack is life imprisonment , but there has been widespread speculation that the seven will receive lesser sentences and then be allowed to stay rather than being sent back to Iraq . The hijack began on Monday when an Amman-bound plane was taken over shortly after it took off from Khartoum . The hijackers threatened to blow it up during a refuelling stop in Cyprus unless they were taken to London . After a search of the aircraft following the hijackers ' surrender , police found only knives and fake explosives .", "links": [], "title_synonyms": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 1266], "labels": [[[0, 5], "Q796"], [[17, 25], "Q1049"], [[52, 58], "Q84"], [[76, 82], "Q796"], [[96, 104], "Q1049"], [[161, 167], "Q84"], [[271, 278], "Q145"], [[364, 372], "Q126579"], [[463, 469], "Q796"], [[534, 540], "Q1316"], [[543, 550], "Q1316"], [[559, 576], "Unknown"], [[712, 719], "Q145"], [[925, 929], "Q796"], [[967, 978], "Unknown"], [[1031, 1039], "Q1963"], [[1109, 1115], "Q229"], [[1142, 1148], "Q84"]]}

Yuri Kushko TAVILDARA , Tajikistan 1996-08-30 Tajik government troops now control of the strategically vital town of Tavildara after driving out Islamic rebels , but sporadic gunfire still echoed in the nearby Pamir mountains on Friday . The commander-in-chief of Tajikistan 's armed forces , Major-General Nikolai Sherbatov , took a group of journalists by helicopter to the remote , and now devastated , town to show that his forces held it . He said his troops took Tavildara without casualties on August 23 , but the crack of sniper and machinegun fire revealed the presence of opposition fighters in the surrounding mountains . Sherbatov said the rebels were located about three km ( two miles ) east of Tavildara around the village of Layron . Tavildara , 200 km ( 120 miles ) east of the capital Dushanbe , was in ruins . Shells had smashed roofs and windows and empty shell cases littered the streets . The town straddles a strategically important road linking government and rebel-held territory and has fallen succesively to both sides in a bloody tug-of-war which began last February . Tajikistan , which borders Afghanistan and China , has been split by a dragging four-year conflict after a civil war between communists and a frail coalition of Islamic and liberal groups . Tens of thousands of people have been killed and many more have been displaced in the fighting , which breached a shaky United Nations-sponsored ceasefire . Tavildara is now apparently inhabited only by a few old men , women and their grubby , barefoot children . Fruit remained on the trees as there was no one to pick it . \" Help me , help me , \" said a chorus of women begging soldiers for food . The town 's school and a shop doubling as a warehouse for humanitarian aid were destroyed in the fighting . \" We had to build our own earth shelters to survive the fighting , \" said Rajab Adinayev , a bearded elderly Tajik in a long white shirt . Although shy in front of the government soldiers , several inhabitants accused government forces of widespread looting of homes and livestock . They also said rebel fighters had looted medicines from the local hospital . One elderly man , who declined to give his name , said two of his sons were now refugees in Moscow and the other two had left to fight for the opposition . He also said government soldiers had raped the wife of one of his sons . \" It 's not important who holds this town , we just need to stop the war , \" he said .", "links": [], "title_synonyms": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 2513], "labels": [[[0, 5], "Q863"], [[43, 54], "Unknown"], [[55, 64], "Q4121877"], [[67, 77], "Q863"], [[89, 94], "Q863"], [[160, 169], "Q4121877"], [[188, 195], "Q432"], [[253, 258], "Q161750"], [[307, 317], "Q863"], [[350, 367], "Unknown"], [[512, 521], "Q4121877"], [[676, 685], "Unknown"], [[752, 761], "Q4121877"], [[784, 790], "Unknown"], [[793, 802], "Q4121877"], [[846, 854], "Q9365"], [[1140, 1150], "Q863"], [[1167, 1178], "Q889"], [[1183, 1188], "Q148"], [[1301, 1308], "Q432"], [[1450, 1474], "Unknown"], [[1487, 1496], "Q4121877"], [[1912, 1926], "Unknown"], [[1947, 1952], "Q863"], [[2290, 2296], "Q649"]]}

We are comfortable the revolution has taken care of us , improved our lives and given us capabilites , \" Samer Ammar Soliman , 42 , told Reuters as he came out of Friday prayers . But some Libyans have begun to show their discontent in the country 's east , which has become a hotbed of militant violence . Tripoli-based diplomats and exiled opponents said Gaddafi 's airforce blasted in July rebel strongholds in the mountainous Jebel al-Akhdar region . Travellers arriving in Egypt say militants and police officers clash regularly in Benghazi . At least 20 people were killed in the capital in early July after bodyguards loyal to Gaddafi 's sons fired at spectators of a football match who were chanting subversive slogans . Gaddafi has dismissed any unrest as the work of foreigners , and last year deported thousands of Sudanese and Egyptian workers .", "links": [], "title_synonyms": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 1920], "labels": [[[0, 7], "Unknown"], [[42, 55], "Q2895624"], [[56, 63], "Q168954"], [[75, 82], "Unknown"], [[113, 120], "Unknown"], [[198, 213], "Q19878"], [[310, 324], "Q1065"], [[347, 352], "Q1016"], [[448, 454], "Q8681"], [[467, 476], "Q216045"], [[479, 487], "Q22"], [[592, 599], "Unknown"], [[718, 730], "Unknown"], [[790, 797], "Q15"], [[814, 819], "Q1032"], [[822, 828], "Unknown"], [[833, 838], "Q117"], [[968, 975], "Q19878"], [[991, 1005], "Q116430"], [[1168, 1187], "Unknown"], [[1200, 1207], "Q130879"], [[1252, 1259], "Unknown"], [[1370, 1383], "Unknown"], [[1420, 1427], "Q19878"], [[1493, 1508], "Unknown"], [[1541, 1546], "Q79"], [[1600, 1608], "Q40816"], [[1697, 1704], "Q19878"], [[1792, 1799], "Q19878"], [[1889, 1897], "Q1049"], [[1902, 1910], "Q79"]]}
{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "Twilight zone for Wall Street as political race heats up . Pierre Belec NEW YORK 1996-08-30 For Wall Street , this is the season to be cautious as the presidential contest puts the stock market in the twilight zone . President Clinton , Bob Dole and Ross Perot are hitting the road now that the partying is over , and people who have billions of dollars invested in stocks were bracing for political promises that could have an impact on their wealth . Analysts believe that the candidates will add to the market 's list of uncertainties , which already includes the question of whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to cool economic growth . They say the politicians will need to promote legislation that helps the economy without scaring the socks off financial markets . \" The worst thing that could happen for financial markets is that if Clinton and Dole start to trade shots in the middle of the ring with one-upmanship , \" said Hugh Johnson , chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. \" That 's when Wall Street will need to worry . \" He said that the bond market would be the first to react if the \" bidding \" intensifies and stocks would quickly drop as interest rates rise . \" I do n't think it would imply the collapse of the stock market , unless the rise in rates touches off a dynamic within the market , which would include selling by portfolio managers , redemptions by individuals of mutual funds that would , in turn , pressure the portfolio managers to sell even more stock . \" This week , the market weighed Dole 's proposal to lower federal income taxes by 15 percent across the board , a package that carries a price tag of $ 548 billion . Clinton proposes an $ 8.4 billion re-election agenda that would spare most home-sellers from capital gains taxes and give employers tax incentives to hire people off the welfare rolls . Clinton claims Dole 's plan would increase the deficit , while the White House said some corporate taxes would be raised to offset the cost of the president 's plan . The experts said there are some unusual risks for the market from this year 's political season because the rush to promise tax cuts to win votes could upset Wall Street 's expectations that Washington will balance the budget . \" The stock market will have to edit the promises and then do a probability study on those edited promises , \" said John Geraghty at the consulting firm North American Equity Services . During the past four presidential elections , the candidate that has favoured tax cuts has won . Ronald Reagan 's tax cut won him a second four-year term in the White House in 1984 , while Democrat Walter Mondale , who promised higher taxes , lost . George Bush became president in 1988 on his no-new-tax campaign and Clinton won in 1992 with a promise to fatten workers ' paychecks . The trick , they said , will be for the candidates to continue to convince Wall Street that the Treasury 's 30-year bond -- the most closely-watched interest rate -- will fall to between 4 percent and 5 percent by the end of the decade . Johnson said that long-term interest rates have already been spooked by the election . The long-term bond jumped this week to 7.13 percent after starting the year at 5.95 percent . The surge of buying in stocks during the last two years has come amid an environment of low interest rates , which has boosted corporate profits . But the market stalled this summer after the Dow Jones industrial average set a record high of 5,778.00 points on May 22 . \" The market does n't seem to be able to make new highs and it has been back and forth in a fairly horizontal mode which looks like a holding pattern , \" said Geraghty . He said the market reflects the political uncertainty , now that Dole has sharply narrowed the gap with Clinton in the polls . Geraghty said that the one thing that could completely turn the election around are new findings in the Whitewater scandal that would damage the Clintons . \" Stocks are on a delicate edge because if something happens that looks like it could upset the presidency , it could throw the political and , to some extent the economic , process into chaos , \" Geraghty said . Right now , Wall Street is pondering the candidates . \" We have an election where there are so many unknown variables that most people will probably want to hold fire , and even take the chance that they will have to pay higher prices for stocks after the November election , than take the risk that a shock to the system will hurt the stock market , \" Geraghty said . On Friday , the Dow Jones index closed down 31.44 points at 5,616.21 . For the week , it was down 106.53 points . The Nasdaq composite index closed 3.53 points lower Friday at 1,141.50 . For the week , it was down 1.55 points . The Standard & Poor 's index of 500 stocks was off 5.41 points at 651.99 , down 15.03 points for the week .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "Brisk economic reports rattle markets anew . Glenn Somerville WASHINGTON 1996-08-30 Factory orders rose in July and manufacturing surged in the Midwest in August , reports said Friday , sparking worries about inflation that battered financial markets for a second straight day . The Commerce Department said orders for manufactured goods climbed 1.8 percent in July to a seasonally adjusted $ 317.6 billion -- nearly twice the increase that had been expected . Shipments of everything from new cars to food items rose , as did order backlogs , in a sign that the strength in the industrial sector would continue in coming months . A separate report from Chicago area purchasing managers underlined the strength in manufacturing as the group 's barometer of manufacturing in the region jumped to 60 in August from 51.2 in July . A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing . While production and orders rose at Midwest area businesses , the prices they paid for goods used in manufacturing remained well in check . Analysts said the reports implied the economy was not slowing down in the third quarter after a burst of growth in the spring , and that the lull in late June and July was more temporary than Federal Reserve policy-makers had wanted . \" It appears that August is showing an economy again reversing course and is not moving onto a significantly slower track at this point , \" said economist Lynn Reaser of Barnett Banks Inc. in Jacksonville , Fla . The reports fanned worries on Wall Street that the Fed , the nation 's central bank , would raise rates next month in a bid to ward off inflation , driving stock and bond prices sharply lower for a second day running . The 30-year Treasury fell almost a point , raising its yield , which moves in the opposite direction from the price , to 7.12 percent from 7.04 percent late Thursday . The Dow Jones industrial average fell 31.44 points to 5,616.21 after a 64.73-point decline Thursday . A third report from the Commerce Department , on July personal income and spending , pointed to a potential slowdown in consumer spending that some analysts said may help moderate growth in the second half . It showed spending rose only 0.2 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 5.15 trillion after dropping a revised 0.4 percent in June . Incomes from wages , salaries and all other sources gained 0.1 percent to a rate of $ 6.47 trillion after a 0.9 percent jump in June . July 's slight gain in incomes was the weakest in six months , since January when they were flat . Economist Joel Naroff of First Union bank in Philadelphia said consumer spending , which fuels two-thirds of the nation 's economy , may be much slower in the third quarter than in the first half , which should slow economic growth . \" The FOMC ( Federal Open Market Committee ) has been forecasting a slowing in economic activity and moderating household demand will have a large impact on overall economic growth , \" Naroff said in a written comment . The policy-making FOMC is to meet on Sept . 24 to plot interest-rate strategy . It already has adopted a bias toward raising rates to keep a lid on wage and price rises and help sustain the 5-1 / 2-year-old economic expansion . In an interview on the cable television network CNBC Friday , Federal Reserve Governor Lawrence Lindsey said there still were \" mixed signals \" about the economy 's direction . \" I think that , on balance , it is looking a little bit on the strong side , \" Lindsey said . He added that with expansion as solid as it is and with unemployment so low \" the greater risks are clearly that we might see some overheating . \" While July consumer spending rose only slightly , there were ample indications that consumers remained confident . The University of Michigan 's August index of consumer sentiment , made available on Friday to paying subscribers , rose to 95.3 from 94.7 in July . Reaser said strong consumer confidence coupled with relatively lean inventories were providing manufacturers with a reason to gear up production . \" The economy is not going to be expanding at the 4.8 percent ( annual ) rate that we had in the second quarter but it is likely to keep expanding in the 3 percent range , \" she said , above the 2 percent to 2-1/4 percent that the Fed considers to be non-inflationary . New orders to factories were strong for durable goods like new cars and for nondurables like paper and food products . Orders for durable goods , meant to last three years or more , rose a revised 1.7 percent in July after falling 0.2 percent in June . Orders for nondurables jumped 1.8 percent following a 1.2 percent decrease in June .", "links": [], "title_synonyms": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 4676], "labels": [[[45, 61], "Unknown"], [[62, 72], "Q61"], [[144, 151], "Q186545"], [[283, 302], "Q503577"], [[654, 661], "Q1297"], [[919, 926], "Q186545"], [[1215, 1230], "Q53536"], [[1413, 1424], "Unknown"], [[1428, 1446], "Unknown"], [[1450, 1462], "Q16568"], [[1465, 1468], "Unknown"], [[1501, 1512], "Q13677"], [[1522, 1525], "Q53536"], [[1702, 1710], "Q648666"], [[1862, 1871], "Q180816"], [[1984, 2003], "Q503577"], [[2567, 2578], "Unknown"], [[2582, 2593], "Unknown"], [[2602, 2614], "Q1345"], [[2797, 2801], "Q2289022"], [[2804, 2833], "Q2289022"], [[2976, 2982], "Unknown"], [[3029, 3033], "Q2289022"], [[3287, 3291], "Q1023912"], [[3301, 3316], "Q53536"], [[3326, 3342], "Q6503830"], [[3496, 3503], "Q6503830"], [[3777, 3799], "Q230492"], [[3922, 3928], "Unknown"], [[4300, 4303], "Q53536"]]}
{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "Mexican avocados not expected in U.S . Maggie McNeil WASHINGTON 1996-08-30 U.S. Agriculture Department officials said Friday that Mexican avocados -- which are restricted from entering the continental United States -- will not likely be entering U.S. markets any time soon , even if the controversial ban were lifted today . \" The opportunity to import ( Mexican avocados ) probably wo n't become possible for another year , \" said Paul Drazek , senior trade advisor to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman . \" We could lift the ban tomorrow , but that would not mean anything immediately , \" said Drazek . \" We probably would not see avacados come in until next season , next November . \" The Agriculture Department proposed more than a year ago to significantly ease an 82-year ban on Mexican avocados . Under the administration 's proposal , the borders to the Mexican produce would be opened into 19 Northern and Northeastern states from November through February . The plan has raised a storm of protest from U.S. avocado growers , who are largely concentrated in California . California growers have charged that removing the restrictions , even on a limited basis , would endanger the $ 1 billion U.S. industry if potentially harmful Mexican insects were brought into the country along with the avocados . Mexican officials contend that there is no scientific basis for the ban , and that it is illegal under international trading rules of the World Trade Organisation . Proponents of the plan discount the worries of the U.S. growers and say the plan has enough safeguards built into it to eliminate any significant threat to American producers . Under the proposal , only imports of export-quality avocados growing in approved orchards in Michoacan , Mexico , the country 's main avocado area , would be allowed . Mexican growers and distributors would have to abide by strict rules established by the Mexican and U.S. agriculture agencies . The California Avocado Commission -- which has spearheaded the opposition to lifting the ban -- said new data the group submitted to the Agriculture Department last spring shows the department underestimated the pest problem in Mexico and have urged that the agency reopen its study of the issue . The administration is still studying the new data , and officials have said that if experts think the information is significant , the agency could reopen its investigation . But U.S. avocado industry sources said that while they may have delayed the plan for a while , they ultimately do not expect the administration to change its position . \" From a common-sense view , the department should reconsider this plan , but due to politics they will probably go ahead with this , \" said Tom Bellamore of the California avocado group . Administration officials said they want to get the issue resolved as quickly as possible , but said there is no timetable they are working under . \" It 's a very complicated issue , \" said the Agriculture Department 's Drazek . \" We 'll get it resolved as quickly as we can , based on the best available science . \"", "links": [], "title_synonyms": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 3095], "labels": [[[0, 7], "Q96"], [[33, 36], "Q30"], [[39, 52], "Unknown"], [[53, 63], "Q61"], [[75, 102], "Q501542"], [[130, 137], "Q96"], [[201, 214], "Q30"], [[246, 250], "Q30"], [[355, 362], "Q96"], [[432, 443], "Unknown"], [[492, 504], "Q370213"], [[596, 602], "Unknown"], [[692, 714], "Q501542"], [[785, 792], "Q96"], [[862, 869], "Q96"], [[1012, 1016], "Q30"], [[1067, 1077], "Q99"], [[1080, 1090], "Q99"], [[1202, 1206], "Q30"], [[1239, 1246], "Q96"], [[1311, 1318], "Q96"], [[1449, 1473], "Q7825"], [[1527, 1531], "Q30"], [[1632, 1640], "Q30"], [[1746, 1755], "Q79861"], [[1758, 1764], "Q96"], [[1821, 1828], "Q96"], [[1909, 1916], "Q96"], [[1921, 1925], "Q30"], [[1953, 1982], "Unknown"], [[2086, 2108], "Q501542"], [[2177, 2183], "Q96"], [[2426, 2430], "Q30"], [[2732, 2745], "Unknown"], [[2753, 2763], "Q99"], [[2973, 2995], "Q501542"], [[2999, 3005], "Unknown"]]}
{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "U.S. Cardinal Bernardin says has terminal cancer . CHICAGO 1996-08-30 Chicago Cardinal Joseph Bernardin , head of the second-largest U.S. Roman Catholic archdiocese , said on Friday his doctors had diagnosed him as having liver cancer and he had a year or less to live . Bernardin , 68 , underwent extensive surgery for pancreatic cancer in June 1995 followed by months of chemotherapy , which he said made him more aware of his own vulnerabilities and the need to minister to the sick . \" On Wednesday , examinations indicated that the cancer has returned , this time in the liver . I am told that it is terminal and that my life expectancy is one year or less , \" a composed Bernardin told a news conference . In 14 years as Chicago 's archbishop , he built a prayerful , saintly image and was deeply involved in world church issues and publicly committed to rooting out abuses by clergy . \" I have been assured that I still have some quality time left , \" he said , saying he would undergo a new form of chemotherapy but his doctors have told him there was only a slim chance of a cure and the liver cancer was inoperable . \" It 's not going to be easy to say goodbye to everybody . Death does have some sad dimensions to it but I am a man of faith , \" he said . \" Death is a natural phenomenom . \" He said he would \" serve until the end \" as cardinal . Pancreatic cancer is among the most deadly forms of the disease , although Bernardin 's case was caught early . Surgeons removed a cancerous kidney , parts of his pancreas and stomach , small intestine , bile duct and surrounding tissues . He made a rapid recovery and resumed most of his duties , but then developed a deteriorating condition in his spine that caused him great pain and shortened his height by several inches . He was scheduled to undergo back surgery next month , but that was cancelled when the cancer was discovered in his liver in order to avoid delaying the start of chemotherapy . The spare , soft-spoken son of an Italian stonecutter took over the Chicago archdiocese , the nation 's second-largest after Los Angeles , with 2.3 million parishioners , in 1982 . Ironically , Bernardin , who developed a progressive , much-praised programme to deal with pedophilia involving priests , became the highest-ranking church official ever accused of sexual improprieties when a former seminary student leveled charges in 1993 that he had been sexually abused by Bernardin during the 1970s . Bernardin steadfastly denied the charges and the former student later recanted his tale of abuse . Bernardin prayed with him before he died from AIDS last year . Bernardin , who became archbishop of Cincinnati in 1972 , played an increasingly prominent role in the U.S. church as a moderate voice of compromise among liberals and conservatives in the ranks of the bishops . This month , he announced that he would oversee a series of conferences to find \" common ground \" among American Catholics . Previously , he was instrumental in drafting church policy on war , peace and nuclear arms , and for seven years he headed the bishops ' anti-abortion policy committee , espousing a policy describing human life as a \" seamless garment . \"", "links": [], "title_synonyms": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 3201], "labels": [[[0, 4], "Q30"], [[14, 23], "Q744108"], [[51, 58], "Q1297"], [[70, 77], "Q1297"], [[87, 103], "Q744108"], [[133, 137], "Q30"], [[138, 152], "Q9592"], [[271, 280], "Q744108"], [[677, 686], "Q744108"], [[727, 734], "Q1297"], [[1432, 1441], "Q744108"], [[1995, 2002], "Q38"], [[2029, 2036], "Q1297"], [[2086, 2097], "Q65"], [[2155, 2164], "Q744108"], [[2435, 2444], "Q744108"], [[2464, 2473], "Q744108"], [[2563, 2572], "Q744108"], [[2609, 2613], "Q12199"], [[2626, 2635], "Q744108"], [[2663, 2673], "Q43196"], [[2729, 2733], "Q30"], [[2942, 2960], "Unknown"]]}
{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "Boatmen 's deal could spark more mergers . Brad Dorfman CHICAGO 1996-08-30 The $ 9.5 billion proposed acquisition of Boatmen 's Bancshares Inc. by NationsBank Corp. could spark a flurry of other mergers involving Missouri banks , which until last year were protected from outside buyers by state regulations . \" NationsBank just strolled into the Midwest and bagged the biggest banking trophy in the landscape , \" said Michael Ancell , banking industry analyst at Edward D. Jones & Co . \" Whoever wants a big market position in the Midwest has to come in and grab Mercantile or Commerce . \" St. Louis-based Mercantile Bancorp Inc. , a bank holding company with $ 18.04 billion in assets , was seen by many analysts as the most attractive Missouri franchise in size after Boatmen 's . Kansas City , Mo.-based Commerce Bancshares Inc. , with $ 9.32 billion in assets , also could help a regional bank establish a strong presence in the lower Midwest , analysts added . \" It focuses more attention on Mercantile , Commerce and Roosevelt , \" said James Weber , analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons . Roosevelt Financial Group Inc is a $ 9.33 billion asset-St . Louis based thrift . \" Now ... the most coveted bank out there is Mercantile , \" Weber said . Mercantile and Commerce did not return phone calls seeking comment . Among those seen as having an interest in buying in Missouri are Minneapolis-based First Bank System Inc. and Norwest Corp. , Ohio-based KeyCorp and Banc One Corp. , and First Chicago NBD Corp. in Illinois . Representatives of First Bank , Norwest , Banc One and First Chicago said the banks do not comment on rumors of possible mergers or acquisitions . KeyCorp , contacted by phone , would not comment . With a presence in nine states and $ 41 billion in assets , Boatmen 's was the prize in Missouri , where barriers to outside acquirers were brought down last year by a federal banking statute . \" Boatmen 's was the plum of Missouri and was the plum of the central Midwest , \" Weber said . Talk that the Missouri banks were seeking inflated prices from buyers was seen as a reason a deal has not occurred sooner .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "Consumer spending , incomes edge up in July . Glenn Somerville WASHINGTON 1996-08-30 Consumer spending barely edged up in July , the Commerce Department said Friday , as income growth slowed abruptly to the weakest pace in six months . Spending rose 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 5.15 trillion after dropping a revised 0.4 percent in June . Incomes from wages , salaries and all other sources gained 0.1 percent to a rate of $ 6.47 trillion after a 0.9 percent jump in June . Department officials said July 's slight gain in incomes was the weakest for any month since January , when they were flat . Wages and salaries came under pressure in July as a shorter average workweek and lower hourly earnings cut into paychecks . The department said wages and salaries decreased by $ 6.9 billion in July after climbing $ 45 billion in June . \" In July , average weekly hours and average hourly earnings declined , more than offsetting the effect of an increase in employment , \" Commerce said . But more money went into savings accounts , as savings held at 5.3 cents out of each dollar earned in both June and July . That was the highest savings rate since October last year , when 5.5 cents out of each dollar earned was being saved . The generally lackluster report on spending and incomes in July had been expected . At the same time , the department said in a separate report that new orders received by U.S. factories climbed strongly in July , with widespread gains across most major categories . Orders increased 1.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 317.6 billion , significantly stronger than the 1 percent rise forecast by Wall Street economists . That followed a revised 0.7 percent decline in June orders . Commerce said previously that spending at retail stores was up only 0.1 percent in July , partly because of softer sales of new cars and light trucks . In addition , the Labour Department 's July employment report had foreshadowed the muted income growth . It showed average hourly earnings fell in July by 0.2 percent to $ 11.00 and the average workweek shortened to 34.3 hours from 34.7 in June . Gains in personal income , which includes wages and salaries as well as income from sources such as dividends , interest and businesses , are essential for funding consumer purchases , which fuel two-thirds of national economic activity . Spending on all types of durable goods , which includes cars , fell to an annual rate of $ 626.3 billion in July from $ 633.6 billion in June . But spending on nondurable products increased moderately to a rate of $ 1.55 trillion from $ 1.54 trillion in June , while spending for services was up to $ 2.97 trillion in July from $ 2.96 trillion . Payrolls of manufacturing companies rose in July by $ 2.3 billion to an annual rate of $ 678 billion .", "links": [], "title_synonyms": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 2826], "labels": [[[46, 62], "Unknown"], [[63, 73], "Q61"], [[133, 152], "Q503577"], [[998, 1006], "Q503577"], [[1428, 1432], "Q30"], [[1654, 1665], "Q13677"], [[1910, 1927], "Unknown"]]}

In another report , sales of new homes jumped unexpectedly in July to the briskest rate in five months , driving prices up in a strong housing market . Sales shot up 7.9 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 783,000 units -- the strongest since February , when new homes were selling at a rate of 784,000 a year . Analysts said the stock market was also worried about the impact on President Clinton 's re-election bid of his top political strategist resigning . Dick Morris , who is credited with resurrecting Clinton 's political fortunes over the past 18 months by masterminding his turn to the political centre , quit after a supermarket tabloid reported he engaged in a yearlong affair with a prostitute , with whom he allegedly shared confidential campaign documents . Analysts said Wall Street had grown accustomed to a moderate Republican in the form of Democratic President Clinton .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "Pirelli cables look to tap Chinese growth . David Jones MILAN 1996-08-30 Italian tyre and cables giant Pirelli on Friday announced its long-awaited move into China with a cables joint venture set to capitalise on the rapidly-growing Chinese telecommunications market . Pirelli is linking with Hong Kong-based group CITIC Pacific in a venture to be called the Wuxi Tong Ling Company Ltd , which will operate in partnership with a local industrial company at its existing factory in Wuxi , Jiangsu province , Shanghai . The partners will invest around $ 30 million in the existing copper cable plant at Wuxi to update technology and include optic fibre production , with annual turnover expected to reach $ 60 million within the next few years . The move marks a further move by Pirelli 's cables division to expand in the fast-growing Far Eastern developing markets with the group already present in Indonesia , India and Malaysia . \" This is really positive news for Pirelli , and I expect that it will produce one of the best half-year results in late September compared to other industrial Italian companies , \" said analyst Paula Buratti at Indosuez . She emphasised that the move was positive because Pirelli will have management control of the Chinese venture , and it also showed another example of Pirelli exporting its technical know-how to developing markets . Pirelli shares reacted favourable even though talks had been underway for some time and news about a venture had been widely expected . The shares rose 0.2 percent to 2,555 lire by 1350 GMT in an easier Milan stock market . This will be Pirelli 's first industrial involvement in a Chinese market where demand for telecommunication networks is expected to grow to 80-100 million new lines between 1996 and 2000 , doubling demand for optical cables . China 's second largest telecoms operator Unicom already has a mandate from the central government to establish 15 million new phone lines by the year 2000 , which will necessitate new trunk line systems and local distribution networks . \" The starting of this production base in China has for our group an undoubted strategic value , representing an important enhancement of our presence in Asia , \" said Pirelli SpA chairman and chief executive officer Marco Tonchetti Provera .

Rolf Soderlind LONGYEAR , Norway 1996-08-30 The windblown , chilly streets of this tiny Arctic town are all but deserted and flags are flying at half-mast beneath a brooding , clouded sky . Longyear is a town in mourning , a close-knit community that has been shattered . Disaster struck on Thursday when a Russian airliner bringing coal miners to work crashed as it came in to land at the airport , killing all 141 people on board . \" It 's a sight I will never forget . I will remember it for the rest of my life , \" said Stig Onarheim . He was one of a handful of rescuers who raced to the scene of the crash in a helicopter on Thursday , hoping in vain to find survivors . The plane smashed into a snow-capped mountain on the Arctic island of Spitzbergen on Thursday , just east of Longyear . \" Imagine a big plane with a lot of luggage and people on board . Think of all that mixed together , with twisted , wrecked parts on the slope , \" Onarheim , 29 , told Reuters . Police and local officials have sealed off the crash site , protecting it from intrusive reporters and from the polar bears that roam freely across the icy expanses . The dead were all Russians and Ukrainians , coming to work in the mining towns of Barentsburg and Pyramiden . Longyear is a Norwegian settlement of just over 1,000 people , but it also feels the loss keenly . \" I have trouble finding the words to express my grief . It 's a tragedy for everyone . We know many of the people who live in Barentsburg , some of them could have been on the plane , \" said Johan Sletten , 52 . Sletten , a caretaker who has lived on the island for 30 years , said the Norwegian and Russian communities visit frequently , competing at soccer in the summer and with snow-scooter races in the winter . Teenage shop assistant Heidi Groenstein was blunter . \" I 'm glad it was not a Norwegian plane , \" she said . \" Just think of it -- a mining village where so many workers die . They must be having a tough time of it now . \" Barentsburg , just a few hours ride by snow-scooter or 15 minutes by helicopter from Longyear , has asked to be left alone with its grief and told reporters to stay away . Around 100 Russian and Ukrainian miners were waiting in Longyear to fly home on the plane that crashed . They were given shelter in the town 's church overnight and ate a sombre breakfast before getting on a bus for the airport . Another plane had been sent from Moscow to pick them up . At this time of year , the only colour in Longyear comes from the brightly-painted wooden houses . Everything else is muddy , the waters of the fjord leaden . Winter is in the air . Barentsburg is an even grimmer place , a run-down testament to the hardships of the new Russia . Spitzbergen lies some 500 miles ( 800 km ) off the northern tip of Norway and endures one of the most extreme climates on the planet . Inhabited by fewer than 3,000 people in total , it sees the sun for 24 hours a day during summer and is plunged into round-the-clock darkness in the winter months . The terrain is mountainous , the only roads are dirt tracks .

LA CORUNA , Spain 1996-08-31 A late goal by newly-signed defender Roberto Carlos saved the blushes of Real Madrid coach Fabio Capello and his multi-billion peseta line-up in the opening game of the Spanish championship on Saturday . The Brazilian 's 79th-minute effort was enough to earn Real a point from a scrappy 1-1 draw at fellow title contenders Deportivo Coruna . Deportivo started strongly , taking the lead midway through the first half when former Auxerre playmaker Corentine Martins headed home a corner after a flick-on by Brazilian-born Spanish international midfielder Donato . Real looked to be in deep trouble shortly after the break when Luis Milla was sent off for committing two bookable offences in as many minutes . But Deportivo were unable to capitalise on their numerical advantage , and were themselves reduced to ten men when Armando Alvarez was sent off 15 minutes from time . Shortly afterwards Roberto Carlos found space in the home defence and equalised for Real with a shot that was deflected past despairing Deportivo ' keeper Jacques Songo'o . In a frantic final five minutes there were chances at both ends , and Donato , who had earlier been booked , was sent off for protesting about the incursion of Real players at a free kick . Before the match Deportivo chairman Augusto Lendoiro said he would ignore a FIFA decision banning Brazilian midfielder Mauro Silva from playing in the match for failing to join his national side 's tour of Europe . In the event , coach John Toshack decided not to use Silva , who had claimed he did not join the Brazil squad because he had lost his passport .", "links": [], "title_synonyms": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 1683], "labels": [[[9, 13], "Q8682"], [[57, 66], "Q8757"], [[69, 74], "Q29"], [[123, 137], "Q429039"], [[159, 170], "Q8682"], [[177, 190], "Q183108"], [[255, 262], "Q29"], [[294, 303], "Q155"], [[345, 349], "Q8682"], [[409, 425], "Unknown"], [[428, 437], "Q8760"], [[515, 522], "Q182876"], [[533, 550], "Unknown"], [[592, 606], "Q155"], [[607, 614], "Q29"], [[640, 646], "Q2176725"], [[649, 653], "Q8682"], [[712, 722], "Q510631"], [[798, 807], "Q8760"], [[909, 924], "Unknown"], [[980, 994], "Q429039"], [[1045, 1049], "Q8682"], [[1097, 1106], "Q8760"], [[1116, 1131], "Unknown"], [[1204, 1210], "Q2176725"], [[1294, 1298], "Q8682"], [[1341, 1350], "Q8760"], [[1360, 1376], "Unknown"], [[1400, 1404], "Q253414"], [[1422, 1431], "Q155"], [[1443, 1454], "Q342457"], [[1530, 1536], "Q46"], [[1560, 1572], "Q342989"], [[1592, 1597], "Unknown"], [[1636, 1642], "Q83459"]]}

Gonzalez , who hit in 21 straight games earlier this season , joined Mickey Rivers as the only players in Texas history with two 20-game streaks in the same year . Gonzalez hit his second homer in the third for his fifth multi-homer game of the season . Gonzalez has three 40-homer seasons and his 121 RBI broke Ruben Sierra 's team record of 119 set in 1989 . The Indians had their four-game winning streak stopped . \" It 's not something I 'm going to try to explain , \" said Texas manager Johnny Oates about his team winning seven of the 10 meetings from Cleveland this season . \" We 've got two more regular season games against them and we might get lucky enough or unlucky enough to play them in the post-season . \" Roger Pavlik ( 15-7 ) gave up three runs and seven hits in 6 1/3 innings and became the fourth 15-game winner in the American League .

In Oakland , Dave Telgheder scattered seven hits over eight innings and Mark McGwire hit his major-league leading 45th homer and drove in three runs as the Athetlics blanked the Boston Red Sox 7-0 .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "RUGBY UNION - SPRINGBOKS FINALLY BREAK ALL BLACK SPELL . Andy Colquhoun JOHANNESBURG 1996-08-31 South Africa managed to avoid a fifth successive defeat in 1996 at the hands of the All Blacks with an emphatic 32-22 victory in front of an ecstatic Ellis Park crowd on Saturday . They scored three tries in recording their highest total against New Zealand , salvaging some pride in a season in which the world champions have lost five out of eight tests . It also ended a run of nine successive victories this year for New Zealand but arrived too late to prevent a 2-1 series defeat and an historic first All Black series triumph on South African soil . Springbok scrum-half Joost van der Westhuizen was his side 's inspiration , scoring their opening try and making the third for flanker Andre Venter from a quickly taken penalty to give his side a 29-8 lead after 54 minutes . Fullback Andre Joubert scored the other , scorching in from 40 metres at the start of the second half to add to his three long-range penalties . The All Blacks salvaged some pride by scoring two tries from centre Walter Little and scrum-half Justin Marshall in the final five minutes to close a gap which at one point stood at 24 points . But they generally endured an off-day , highlighted by recalled fly-half Andrew Mehrtens who missed five out of eight kicks at goal . Recalled fly-half Henry Honiball kicked the Springboks into a 6-0 lead after 10 minutes only to see Andrew Mehrtens launch a penalty from eight metres inside his own half to narrow the gap . Mehrtens missed three further penalties and a conversion in the first 40 minutes which could have put his side ahead , but it was the Springboks who looked the more dangerous . Their promise was realised when Joubert made a 40-metre break in the 25th minute and , although winger Pieter Hendriks appeared to knock on Joubert 's reverse pass , Welsh referee Derek Bevan allowed Van der Westhuizen to pick up and score under the posts . Honiball converted and Joubert kicked a penalty before All Black hooker Sean Fitzpatrick scored a try from close range on the stroke of half-time to narrow the lead to 16-8 and hint at a comeback . Instead Joubert kicked another long penalty and then raced around the outside of the defence to score the Springboks ' second try . A quick penalty from Van der Westhuizen five metres from the All Black line set up the third try for Venter five minutes later and when Joubert kicked his third penalty the Springboks held an unassailable 32-8 lead going into the last quarter . When the All Blacks did break through , it was too late . Centre Walter Little followed up Mehrtens ' kick to score under the posts and scrum-half Justin Marshall forced himself over from a ruck close to the line in injury-time to give them some consolation .

The match boiled over when Hill made to walk off court after what he claimed was a game-winning point in the third . When the referee called Jansher 's return good and the decision was accepted by the player , Hill shrieked at the Pakistani : \" You cheat . \" \" He was standing right there and knew the shot was down so I called him a cheat , \" said Hill , whose squash career has been blighted by fines and suspensions for unacceptable behaviour . \" He knew it was down and accepted what I called him because of that . \" Hill won the game on the next point and said later that Jansher was generally honest on court but played by the referee 's decision .

Spain travels to Belgium , while the U.S. team heads to the Netherlands for first-round matches March 1-2 . The other two first-round ties will pit hosts Germany against the Czech Republic and visiting France against Japan . The semifinals are July 19-20 , and the final September 27- 28 .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "BASEBALL - KEVIN BROWN LOWERS ERA AS MARLINS BEAT REDS . CINCINNATI 1996-08-31 Major league ERA leader Kevin Brown threw an eight-hitter and Devon White 's RBI double snapped a fifth-inning tie as the Florida Marlins beat the Cincinnati Reds 3-1 for their seventh straight win Friday . Brown ( 14-10 ) tied Todd Stottlemyre of the Cardinals for the National League lead with his fifth complete game and lowered his major league-leading earned run average from 1.96 to 1.92 . He struck out eight and did not walk a batter . Brown threw 119 pitches and won for the third time in as many starts against the Reds this season . \" Bolesy ( Florida manager John Boles ) told me yesterday , ' You have to go nine tomorrow , ' \" Brown said . \" In the early innings , I was struggling , I was just trying to make it from pitch to pitch . I gave up a lot of hits in the early innings and I was n't thinking about the seventh , eighth or ninth . I was n't satisfied with any of my pitches and I did a better job of moving the ball around in the later innings . \" \" He has a devastating sinker , \" observed Reds manager Ray Knight . \" The guys say it moved more than everyone in the league . I remember Nolan Ryan saying in ' 91 or ' 92 that he was the best young pitcher coming around in a long time and he saw ( Tom ) Seaver and ( Jerry ) Koosman when they were starting . \" In Philadelphia , Delino DeShields 's triple in the top of the 12th off Jeff Parrett ( 2-3 ) scored Chad Curtis and lifted the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 7-6 victory over the Phillies . Los Angeles won for the seventh time in eight games . Darren Dreifort ( 1-1 ) picked up the win after allowing a hit and a walk over 2 1/3 scoreless innings . Todd Worrell worked the 12th to earn his league-leading 37th save . The Phillies have dropped five of their last six overall , and nine of 11 at home . Billy Ashley belted a three-run homer for Los Angeles . In Chicago , the Braves and Cubs split a doubleheader . In the first game , Ryne Sandberg snapped an eighth-inning tie with an infield single and Kevin Foster ( 6-2 ) outdueled Atlanta 's Tom Glavine ( 13-8 ) for his third straight win , 3-2 . Foster , a .333 hitter , helped his own cause in the second with a two-run single . The Braves took the second game when Chipper Jones singled home the tying run in the top of the ninth and Andruw Jones took advantage of a poor throw to score the go-ahead run on a sacrifice fly for a 6-5 victory . Cubs shortstop Jose Hernandez committed three of Chicago 's four errors . Mike Mordecai singled , doubled and homered for Atlanta , which has won 14 of its last 19 games and has the best record in the majors , 84-50 . In Montreal , Scott Sanders allowed one hit over eight innings and Wally Joyner hit a two-run single in a four-run third as the San Diego Padres blanked the Expos 6-0 for their sixth straight win . Sanders ( 8-4 ) struck out 10 and walked three to win his fourth straight . He allowed a leadoff double to David Segui in the second , and won for the seventh time in eight decisions . The right-hander retired 14 batters in a row from the second inning through the seventh . Mike Oquist allowed one Montreal hit in the ninth . Montreal lost for the ninth time in 14 games . In New York , Marvin Benard 's two-run homer snapped a tie and Shawn Estes came one out away from his first complete game as the San Francisco Giants beat the Mets 6-4 . Benard , hitting .467 ( 14-for-30 ) against the Mets this season , hit his first pitch from Pete Harnisch ( 8-10 ) in the seventh over the right-field fence to put the Giants up 4-2 . Estes ( 3-4 ) was lifted for closer Rod Beck after yielding a single with two out in the ninth . Beck allowed a two-run double to Alvaro Espinoza , who collected a career-high four RBI , but struck out Brent Mayne for his 31st save . The loss was the Mets ' eighth straight , their longest slide since September 1993 , and dropped them to 0-4 under new manager Bobby Valentine . In St Louis , Tom Pagnozzi had three hits and three RBI and Alan Benes scattered six hits over six-plus innings as the Cardinals beat the Colorado Rockies 7-4 . Benes ( 12-8 ) allowed three runs , walked three and struck out three for the win . St Louis defeated Colorado for just the second time in 12 meetings dating back to last season . Ray Lankford went 4-for-5 with a pair of doubles for the Cardinals , who won for just the third time in 11 games . Eric Anthony hit a pair of solo homers for the Rockies . In Pittsburgh , Sean Berry tied a career high with six RBI and Donne Wall fired a seven-hitter for his first major-league shutout as the Houston Astros routed the Pirates 10-0 . It was the third time Berry had six RBI in one game . Wall ( 9-4 ) struck out four and walked none to post his second complete game of the season and third straight win .", "links": [], "title_synonyms": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 4842], "labels": [[[11, 22], "Q867833"], [[30, 33], "Unknown"], [[37, 44], "Q652879"], [[50, 54], "Q826751"], [[57, 67], "Q43196"], [[92, 95], "Unknown"], [[103, 114], "Q867833"], [[141, 152], "Q5267779"], [[156, 159], "Unknown"], [[201, 216], "Q652879"], [[226, 241], "Q826751"], [[286, 291], "Unknown"], [[307, 323], "Q7812659"], [[331, 340], "Q504309"], [[349, 364], "Q858082"], [[523, 528], "Unknown"], [[604, 608], "Q826751"], [[625, 631], "Unknown"], [[634, 641], "Q652879"], [[650, 660], "Q6222378"], [[720, 725], "Unknown"], [[1094, 1098], "Q826751"], [[1107, 1117], "Q3420530"], [[1190, 1200], "Q721948"], [[1299, 1313], "Unknown"], [[1318, 1335], "Unknown"], [[1367, 1379], "Q1345"], [[1382, 1398], "Q3021671"], [[1436, 1448], "Q3176572"], [[1464, 1475], "Q5066215"], [[1491, 1510], "Q334634"], [[1537, 1545], "Q650840"], [[1548, 1559], "Q334634"], [[1602, 1617], "Q5224891"], [[1707, 1719], "Q3530292"], [[1779, 1787], "Q650840"], [[1859, 1871], "Q4912127"], [[1901, 1912], "Q334634"], [[1918, 1925], "Q1297"], [[1932, 1938], "Q461595"], [[1943, 1947], "Q246782"], [[1991, 2004], "Q3453949"], [[2061, 2073], "Q6396302"], [[2092, 2099], "Q461595"], [[2103, 2114], "Q943668"], [[2159, 2165], "Unknown"], [[2247, 2253], "Q461595"], [[2280, 2293], "Q948508"], [[2349, 2361], "Q1376903"], [[2458, 2462], "Q246782"], [[2473, 2487], "Unknown"], [[2507, 2514], "Q246782"], [[2532, 2545], "Q10329950"], [[2580, 2587], "Q461595"], [[2679, 2687], "Q340"], [[2690, 2703], "Q11311626"], [[2743, 2755], "Q429733"], [[2804, 2820], "Q721134"], [[2833, 2838], "Q1148233"], [[2874, 2881], "Unknown"], [[2981, 2992], "Q3018769"], [[3149, 3160], "Q6848275"], [[3173, 3181], "Q1148233"], [[3201, 3209], "Q1148233"], [[3251, 3259], "Q60"], [[3262, 3275], "Q6778293"], [[3311, 3322], "Q7491338"], [[3377, 3397], "Q308966"], [[3407, 3411], "Q692417"], [[3418, 3424], "Q6778293"], [[3466, 3470], "Q692417"], [[3510, 3523], "Q7172005"], [[3586, 3592], "Q308966"], [[3602, 3607], "Q7491338"], [[3638, 3646], "Q3438072"], [[3699, 3703], "Q3438072"], [[3732, 3747], "Unknown"], [[3783, 3786], "Unknown"], [[3804, 3815], "Q4961469"], [[3853, 3857], "Q692417"], [[3963, 3978], "Q1101104"], [[3984, 3992], "Q38022"], [[3995, 4007], "Q7817149"], [[4033, 4036], "Unknown"], [[4041, 4051], "Q4706162"], [[4100, 4109], "Q504309"], [[4119, 4135], "Q388858"], [[4142, 4147], "Q4706162"], [[4226, 4234], "Unknown"], [[4244, 4252], "Q388858"], [[4322, 4334], "Q7297736"], [[4379, 4388], "Q504309"], [[4437, 4449], "Q5386033"], [[4484, 4491], "Q388858"], [[4497, 4507], "Q1342"], [[4510, 4520], "Q3476696"], [[4549, 4552], "Unknown"], [[4557, 4567], "Q5296563"], [[4631, 4645], "Q848117"], [[4657, 4664], "Q653772"], [[4694, 4699], "Q3476696"], [[4708, 4711], "Unknown"], [[4726, 4730], "Q5296563"]]}
{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "TENNIS - EDBERG REFUSES TO QO QUIETLY . Richard Finn NEW YORK 1996-08-30 Refusing to go quietly in the night , Stefan Edberg extended his stay at his 14th and last U.S. Open when Bernd Karbacher , trailing and hurting , quit in the fourth set of their second-round match Friday . The 30-year-old Edberg , a former two-time Open champion , had wrestled control of the match away from Karbacher when the German , hampered by a left hamstring injury , decided he could n't continue under the stadium lights at the National Tennis Centre . \" A win is a win . I 'll take it , \" Edberg , who has announced that this will be his last Grand Slam event , said of the 3-6 6-3 6-3 1-0 victory . Ironically , Karbacher two years ago ended Ivan Lendl 's Grand Slam career here when the former champion had to retire in the middle of their first-round match . After seeing the trainer come out early in the third set , Edberg was not surprised by Karbacher 's decision not to go on . \" I knew he had problems with something , \" Edberg said . \" I really was n't surprised . \" Edberg had his own problems early in the match as the Swede battled to acclimate himself to the nighttime conditions while Karbacher was ripping passing shots and blasting serves past him . \" I did n't really feel good to begin with , I had problems finding the timing on the ball , seeing the ball , \" said Edberg , who upset Wimbledon champion and fifth-seeded Richard Krajicek in the first round . \" This was one of these matches where I did n't play up to my standard . I had to fight hard . \" Edberg 's tenacity paid off in the second set . Edberg lost his own serve twice , but he rallied for three breaks of his own , the last to wrap up the set . \" That 's where the match sort of changed , \" said Edberg . \" I think once I got that second set , I felt a lot better about my game . \" Edberg is starting to feel pretty good about postponing his swan song a lot longer . \" It does n't look all that bad , \" Edberg said of his path through the draw starting next with a match against Krajicek 's Dutch countryman Paul Haarhuis . However , the 1991 and 1992 champion is not ready to start making plans to be in next week 's final . \" I 'm always being realistic , \" said Edberg . \" Like I said many times , I think it 's a very little chance , but nothing is impossible . If I play great tennis , that could take me a long way . \" A lot of things can happen , like tonight . \"", "links": [], "title_synonyms": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 2441], "labels": [[[9, 15], "Q189542"], [[40, 52], "Unknown"], [[53, 61], "Q60"], [[111, 124], "Q189542"], [[164, 173], "Q123577"], [[179, 194], "Q73280"], [[296, 302], "Q189542"], [[323, 327], "Unknown"], [[383, 392], "Q73280"], [[402, 408], "Q183"], [[511, 533], "Unknown"], [[573, 579], "Q189542"], [[627, 637], "Q102113"], [[697, 706], "Q73280"], [[727, 737], "Q182736"], [[741, 751], "Q102113"], [[905, 911], "Q189542"], [[933, 942], "Q73280"], [[1014, 1020], "Q189542"], [[1061, 1067], "Q189542"], [[1115, 1120], "Unknown"], [[1184, 1193], "Q73280"], [[1369, 1375], "Q189542"], [[1388, 1397], "Q41520"], [[1424, 1440], "Q309859"], [[1559, 1565], "Q189542"], [[1607, 1613], "Q189542"], [[1767, 1773], "Q189542"], [[1853, 1859], "Q189542"], [[1974, 1980], "Q189542"], [[2050, 2058], "Q309859"], [[2062, 2067], "Q55"], [[2079, 2092], "Q29441"], [[2236, 2242], "Q189542"]]}

Steve Pagani VIENNA 1996-08-31 Austria dominated their World Cup group four qualifier against Scotland on Saturday with wave after wave of attacks but were unable to penetrate the visitors ' defence and had to settle for a goalless draw . Scotland , who thrashed Belarus 5-1 in their opening group four match , were unable to repeat their performance . Austria 's best chance came in the 63rd minute with Stephan Marasek of SC Freiburg taking advantage of a scramble in the Scottish penalty area but his shot narrowly passing the left-hand post .

PARIS 1996-08-31 Euro 96 absentee Nicolas Ouedec and Youri Djorkaeff scored the goals as 1998 World Cup hosts France beat Mexico 2-0 in a friendly international on Saturday . The victory extended to 29 matches France 's unbeaten run under coach Aime Jacquet , their Euro 96 semifinal elimination having come in a penalty shoot-out , but was marred by the sending-off of Chelsea central defender Franck Leboeuf . Leboeuf was dismissed two minutes from time for a second bookable offence , fouling Mexican substitute Ricardo Pelaez who minutes earlier had also been shown the yellow card for pushing the Chelsea defender in the back . Both goals came early in the second half after France had surprised the Mexicans with three half-time substitutions . After a sterile first half , France injected more sting in midfield with the introduction of Juventus 's Zinedine Zidane . This allowed Djorkaeff to play further up and his cross from the right fell for Ouedec , who has joined Espanyol of Barcelona from Nantes since missing the European championship finals through injury , to score after a mistake by midfielder Joaquin del Olmo . Within four minutes Ouedec was returning the compliment for Djorkaeff , playing a one-two with the Internazionale Milan forward down the middle to set him up for a cross shot past diving goalkeeper Osvaldo Sanchez .

Bert Lauwers BRUSSELS 1996-08-31 Belgium kicked off their 1998 World Cup campaign with a hard-fought 2-1 victory over 10-man Turkey in a tense match marred by Turkish crowd trouble shortly after the break . Turkish fans , upset at their team 's 2-0 first-half deficit , ripped apart dozens of plastic seats and threw them over the fence . Riot police took 10 minutes to restore order . The police were given an unexpected hand by second-half substitute Sergen Yalcin who rekindled Turkish hopes in the 61st with a splendid half-volley which stunned Belgian goalkeeper Filip De Wilde . But Yalcin , who had come on just four minutes earlier , turned from hero to villain barely two minutes after his strike when he was sent off after spitting at an opponent and arguing with English referee David Elleray . Marc Degryse had opened the scoring for Belgium after 13 minutes , whacking a low 10-metre drive into the net after an incisive pass by defender Dirk Medved from the edge of the penalty area . Brazilian-born Luis Oliveira then gleefully slipped the ball past goalkeeper Rustu Recber from the right of the area to make it 2-0 seven minutes before the interval , Turkey 's best first-half effort proving to be a vicious 30-metre shot by Ogun Temizkanoglu which De Wilde tipped over . The visitors , seeking to restore some pride after failing to score a single goal in Euro 96 in June , repeatedly ripped through the left side of the home defence but De Wilde was able to block several sharply-angled efforts . With only the group seven winners qualifying automatically for the 1998 finals in France , Belgium could not afford a slip-up at home and they frantically chased a decisive third goal . But they were almost upset 12 minutes from time when De Wilde fumbled a hard Arif Erdem shot and Orhan Cikirikci almost pounced on the loose ball . Belgium 's best second-half effort came three minutes later when Degryse put the ball over the bar from close range with Recber beaten .

More than a thousand women , children and men gathered in a field to the north of the town of Urus-Martan on Saturday to wait for a column of rebels to withdraw from the capital Grozny about 25 km ( 12 miles ) away . The men fired weapons into the air as groups of women danced . Adults in the crowd carried posters of former Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev -- who declared independence in 1991 -- and children , carrying photographs of him , called \" Troops out ! \" . Russian military officials have expressed fears that the rebels and their supporters will see the deal signed by Russian peace envoy Alexander Lebed in the early hours of Saturday as a military victory for the separatists . It involves the withdrawal of Russian troops sent to Chechnya in December 1994 to crush the separatists and a postponement of the issue at the heart of the conflict -- the status of the mainly-Moslem North Caucasus region . But the people in the crowd on Saturday , who had turned out in support of the rebels , did not seem sure that the war was over . \" We hope for the best , that it really has ended so we can live in peace .

Aiza Dudayeva , with her 10-year-old son beside her , shared the guarded optimism . \" We really want the war to end , we hope and believe that our sons and brothers will win , \" said Dudayeva , adding that she was from Urus-Martan . Urus-Martan is a traditionally anti-separatist pocket in Chechnya and Moscow-backed leader Doku Zavgayev , who has been sidelined in the peace deal , has warned that it and places like it could become centres of civil war if Russian troops leave . But on Saturday the people gathered just outside the town seemed to be united in favour of the separatists .

The consortium wanted 40 percent of Ruch 's shares , the state would get 20 percent of Ruch and 40 percent would be offered on the Warsaw stock exchange . \" This division would guarantee a dispersal of capital , preventing anyone from taking total control over Ruch and dictating market conditions , \" the paper quoted one of the initiators of the move as saying , without giving a name .

It aims to invest $ 200 million in Ruch over five years -- more than the sum Ruch says it needs to upgrade its outlets . Initially Poland offered up to 75 percent of Ruch but in March Kaczmarek cancelled the tender and offered a minority stake with an option to increase the equity . Two consortia -- UWP-Hachette and a consortium of a Polish SPC group and Swiss firms -- placed initial bids . But after the change of tender conditions Swiss investors pulled out and SPC decided to bid jointly with UWP-Hachette .

Xiao Qiang , executive director of the New York-based group Human Rights in China , said Wang 's arrest on Friday appeared to be part of the national \" Strike Hard \" campaign that has imprisoned thousands and sent hundreds to their death . Although supposedly aimed at criminals , dozens of human rights activists have been detained in the campaign , which is meant to strengthen the Communist Party 's grip on power as senior leader Deng Xiaoping nears death , Xiao said in an interview . \" China is going through this power transition period . The authorities are apparently extremely afraid of any political and social discontent , \" said Xiao , in Manila to attend an Amnesty International conference on human rights in China .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "Burma 's Suu Kyi says military rulers abuse law . Deborah Charles RANGOON 1996-08-31 Burma 's democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi hit out at the government on Saturday for recent arrests and jailing of activists , saying the military abused the law to try to crush the democracy movement . \" The main purpose of this press conference is to make it known to the world that the authorities are misusing the law all the time in order to try to crush the democracy movement , \" Suu Kyi told reporters at her Rangoon home . Suu Kyi said at least 61 democracy supporters had been arrested since May , and about 30 of them had been sentenced , most to long prison terms . In May the government launched a sweeping crackdown on the democracy movement , detaining over 260 members of Suu Kyi 's National League for Democracy ( NLD ) ahead of a party congress . Most were released but several dozen remain in custody . The Burmese government last week confirmed the recent sentencing of nine democracy activists who were arrested in the May crackdown , including Suu Kyi 's assistant Win Htein . The military government , which in May said it had detained the politicians to prevent anarchy , said the activists were charged with attempting to destroy the peace and stability of the state . But Suu Kyi disagreed with the methods , saying officials often arrested NLD supporters in the middle of the night , then did not give them the opportunity to defend themselves in trials . \" When our people are tried , they are tried in a very secretive way . Their families are not told , \" she said . Suu Kyi , who spearheads a campaign for sanctions on Burma 's government , was under house arrest for six years without being tried before being released in July 1995 . Several other leading members of the NLD have served prison terms . The NLD party won a landslide victory in a 1990 election but the State Law and Order Restoration Council ( SLORC ) , which assumed power in 1988 after crushing pro-democracy demonstrations , never recognised the poll . \" This lack of rule of law is an indication that the authorities are not interested in fair play , \" she said . \" They are using a travesty of the law to try and crush our movements and to sentence our people to long terms in prison without proper trial . \" Suu Kyi said once the activists were sentenced , they suffered inhuman conditions and lack of rights in prison . \" Almost all of the prisoners start suffering from various health problems after a couple of years in jail , \" she said . \" Some of our people have been in prison for five to six years . \" Most political prisoners are held in Rangoon 's Insein Prison . Some who have been released have recounted torture methods like sleep and food deprivation and physical abuse . \" If there are any more instances of death in custody it will be further proof that a prison sentence for political prisoners is sometimes almost the same as a death sentence , \" Suu Kyi said . Hla Than , an elected member of parliament for the NLD , died in early August after being at Insein for six years . His death came five weeks after James Leander ( Leo ) Nichols , a close friend of Suu Kyi and Danish honorary consul , died while serving a prison term at Insein . Suu Kyi said the government had increased its repression tactics on the democracy movement because it feared the growing popularity of the movement . But she said she and the NLD would not stop their efforts to bring democracy to Burma even if it meant more arrests of party members or even herself . \" We will carry on .

DETROIT 1996-08-31 Automakers , suppliers , insurers and the federal government 's auto safety agency Saturday launched a $ 10 million safety awareness campaign aimed at reducing the number of children killed accidentally by air bags in cars and trucks . Officials said they will work with law enforcement agencies , pediatricians and media to warn parents about the dangers that air bags pose to children and adults not wearing seatbelts . Since 1993 , 24 children have been killed by the explosive force of automotive air bags , which inflate at speeds up to 200 miles per hour .

An estimated 50,000 people have died in Algeria 's violence pitting Moslem rebels against government forces since early 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a commanding lead .", "links": [], "title_synonyms": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 1301], "labels": [[[0, 7], "Q262"], [[50, 55], "Q90"], [[108, 115], "Q3561"], [[151, 159], "Q262"], [[189, 197], "Q262"], [[356, 364], "Q2217496"], [[371, 379], "Q3224404"], [[463, 470], "Unknown"], [[718, 728], "Unknown"], [[755, 762], "Q262"], [[821, 829], "Q262"], [[852, 885], "Unknown"], [[888, 892], "Unknown"], [[1028, 1034], "Q432"], [[1110, 1117], "Q262"], [[1138, 1144], "Q432"], [[1262, 1271], "Q189746"]]}

BONN 1996-08-31 Iranian security forces burst into the home of a German cultural attache in Tehran a month ago and seized his guests for questioning , Bonn 's foreign ministry said on Saturday . A spokesman said he could substantially confirm a report in the news weekly Der Spiegel , which said Iranian secret police burst in while attache Jens Gust was entertaining six Iranian writers and their wives . Gust was threatened with violence , then locked into a room to be interrogated on suspicion of \" promoting activities hostile to the state \" while his guests were taken away , the magazine said . The ministry spokesman said the German embassy immediately made a sharp protest to the Tehran government . The Iranian ambassador was also summoned to the ministry in Bonn to hear a sharp protest and \" disapproval of this glaring breach of the principles of international law \" , he added . Iran subsequently said it regretted the incident , which it said had been the result of a misunderstanding . All those detained appeared to have been freed , the spokesman said . Relations between the two countries are currently under strain because of the testimony in a Berlin court of former Iranian president Abolhassan Banisadr . Banisadr , an avowed opponent of the Tehran government who now lives in exile , accused top Iranian leaders of personally ordering the assassination of three exiled Kurdish leaders in a Berlin restaurant in 1992 . Iran has asked Germany to extradite Banisadr , who is due is due back in Berlin next Thursday to continue his testimony . Banisadr , who received political asylum in France after fleeing there in 1981 , told Der Spiegel he did not plan to ask for a guarantee of safe conduct . If Germany were to extradite him , he said , it would \" lose face before the whole world \" . German prosecutors have already accused Iran 's intelligence minister Ali Fallahiyan of ordering the killing of the Kurdish leaders . Iran , which denies the allegations , urged German authorities to disregard Banisadr 's testimony and said it could hurt relations .", "links": [], "title_synonyms": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 2132], "labels": [[[0, 4], "Q794"], [[20, 26], "Q183"], [[47, 51], "Q586"], [[54, 58], "Q586"], [[70, 77], "Q794"], [[119, 125], "Q183"], [[146, 152], "Q3616"], [[205, 209], "Q586"], [[325, 336], "Q131478"], [[350, 357], "Q794"], [[395, 404], "Unknown"], [[426, 433], "Q794"], [[460, 464], "Unknown"], [[688, 694], "Q183"], [[743, 749], "Q3616"], [[767, 774], "Q794"], [[823, 827], "Q586"], [[947, 951], "Q794"], [[1219, 1225], "Q64"], [[1242, 1249], "Q794"], [[1260, 1279], "Q273866"], [[1282, 1290], "Q273866"], [[1319, 1325], "Q3616"], [[1374, 1381], "Q794"], [[1447, 1454], "Q41470"], [[1468, 1474], "Q64"], [[1496, 1500], "Q794"], [[1511, 1518], "Q183"], [[1532, 1540], "Q273866"], [[1569, 1575], "Q64"], [[1618, 1626], "Q273866"], [[1662, 1668], "Q142"], [[1704, 1715], "Q131478"], [[1776, 1783], "Q183"], [[1866, 1872], "Q183"], [[1906, 1910], "Q794"], [[1936, 1950], "Unknown"], [[1982, 1989], "Q41470"], [[2000, 2004], "Q794"], [[2044, 2050], "Q183"], [[2076, 2084], "Q273866"]]}

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "Controversial IRA film screened at Venice festival . Vera Haller VENICE , Italy 1996-08-31 Dublin-born director Neil Jordan says he never lost more sleep over a film than over \" Michael Collins \" , his controversial epic about the IRA which has its premiere on Saturday at the Venice Film Festival . The film , starring Liam Neeson and Julia Roberts , recounts the life of Michael Collins , the Irish Republican Army 's Director of Intelligence who fought for Irish independence from 1919 to 1921 . Although not due for release in Britain until early next year , some politicians have already said they feared it would fan sectarian tensions in British-ruled Northern Ireland . Jordan defends his decision to make the film , whose screenplay he wrote himself after years of research , saying it was \" more about history than any political statement \" . \" The film spares neither the Irish nor the British in its depiction of the savagery of the time , \" Jordan said in a statement released by Warner Bros . \" How often has independence been achieved without bloodshed ? Very rarely . \" Jordan , whose 1992 film \" The Crying Game \" also came under fire for what was perceived as a sympathetic portrayal of the IRA , said Collins was more than just a revolutionary . \" He developed techniques of guerilla warfare later copied by independence movements around the world , from Mao Tse-Tung in China to Yitzak Shamir in Israel , \" Jordan said . \" Collins would never be a proponent of contemporary terrorism as practised today . He was a soldier and a statesman and , over time , a man of peace . \" Leeson , the Northern Ireland-born actor who was nominated for an Oscar for best actor for his performance in \" Schindler 's List \" , plays the lead role in Jordan 's film . Aidan Quinn portrays Harry Boland , Collins ' best friend , and rival for the love of Kitty Kiernan , played by Roberts . Much of the film was shot on location in Dublin with Jordan using thousands of its citizens as unpaid extras . A set , however , was used for the fighting scenes . Noting that information about Collins was \" as mysterious as the existence he maintained \" , Jordan said he made some historical assumptions in the film . \" I have made choices about certain events based on my own extensive research into his letters and reported speeches , \" he said . \" I wanted to make this a story as accurate as possible without killing it dramatically and I think I have . It is a very true film . \" One of the assumptions is his interpretation of the murky circumstances surrounding the shooting death of Collins , who had broken with his comrades when he sought a negotiated settlement with Britain , in an ambush in 1922 . \" I have never lost more sleep over the making of a film than I have over ' Michael Collins ' , but I 'll never make a more important one , \" Jordan said . \" In the life of one person you can tell the events that formed the north and south of Ireland as they are today . \"", "links": [], "title_synonyms": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 2975], "labels": [[[14, 17], "Q175284"], [[35, 41], "Q641"], [[53, 64], "Unknown"], [[74, 79], "Q38"], [[112, 123], "Q55428"], [[178, 193], "Q430535"], [[231, 234], "Q175284"], [[277, 297], "Q49024"], [[320, 331], "Q58444"], [[336, 349], "Q40523"], [[373, 388], "Q173196"], [[395, 416], "Q175284"], [[460, 465], "Q27"], [[531, 538], "Q145"], [[645, 658], "Unknown"], [[659, 675], "Q26"], [[678, 684], "Q55428"], [[883, 888], "Q27"], [[897, 904], "Q145"], [[954, 960], "Q55428"], [[993, 1004], "Q126399"], [[1086, 1092], "Q55428"], [[1113, 1128], "Q182727"], [[1209, 1212], "Q175284"], [[1220, 1227], "Q173196"], [[1374, 1386], "Q5816"], [[1390, 1395], "Q148"], [[1399, 1412], "Q184351"], [[1416, 1422], "Q801"], [[1427, 1433], "Q55428"], [[1443, 1450], "Q173196"], [[1595, 1601], "Unknown"], [[1608, 1629], "Unknown"], [[1661, 1666], "Q103916"], [[1707, 1724], "Unknown"], [[1752, 1758], "Q55428"], [[1769, 1780], "Q403902"], [[1790, 1802], "Q1785574"], [[1805, 1812], "Q173196"], [[1855, 1868], "Q4581421"], [[1881, 1888], "Q40523"], [[1932, 1938], "Q1761"], [[1944, 1950], "Q55428"], [[2085, 2092], "Q173196"], [[2148, 2154], "Q55428"], [[2583, 2590], "Q173196"], [[2670, 2677], "Q145"], [[2779, 2794], "Q430535"], [[2845, 2851], "Q55428"], [[2946, 2953], "Q22890"]]}
