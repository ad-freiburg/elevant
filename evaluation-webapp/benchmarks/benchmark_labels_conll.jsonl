{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "EU rejects German call to boycott British lamb . Peter Blackburn BRUSSELS 1996-08-22 The European Commission said on Thursday it disagreed with German advice to consumers to shun British lamb until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to sheep . Germany 's representative to the European Union 's veterinary committee Werner Zwingmann said on Wednesday consumers should buy sheepmeat from countries other than Britain until the scientific advice was clearer . \" We do n't support any such recommendation because we do n't see any grounds for it , \" the Commission 's chief spokesman Nikolaus van der Pas told a news briefing . He said further scientific study was required and if it was found that action was needed it should be taken by the European Union . He said a proposal last month by EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler to ban sheep brains , spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains was a highly specific and precautionary move to protect human health . Fischler proposed EU-wide measures after reports from Britain and France that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy ( BSE ) -- mad cow disease . But Fischler agreed to review his proposal after the EU 's standing veterinary committee , mational animal health officials , questioned if such action was justified as there was only a slight risk to human health . Spanish Farm Minister Loyola de Palacio had earlier accused Fischler at an EU farm ministers ' meeting of causing unjustified alarm through \" dangerous generalisation . \" . Only France and Britain backed Fischler 's proposal . The EU 's scientific veterinary and multidisciplinary committees are due to re-examine the issue early next month and make recommendations to the senior veterinary officials . Sheep have long been known to contract scrapie , a brain-wasting disease similar to BSE which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste . British farmers denied on Thursday there was any danger to human health from their sheep , but expressed concern that German government advice to consumers to avoid British lamb might influence consumers across Europe . \" What we have to be extremely careful of is how other countries are going to take Germany 's lead , \" Welsh National Farmers ' Union ( NFU ) chairman John Lloyd Jones said on BBC radio . Bonn has led efforts to protect public health after consumer confidence collapsed in March after a British report suggested humans could contract an illness similar to mad cow disease by eating contaminated beef . Germany imported 47,600 sheep from Britain last year , nearly half of total imports . It brought in 4,275 tonnes of British mutton , some 10 percent of overall imports .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 2790], "labels": [[[0, 2], "Unknown"], [[11, 17], "Q183"], [[34, 41], "Q145"], [[49, 64], "Unknown"], [[65, 73], "Q240"], [[89, 108], "Q8880"], [[144, 150], "Q183"], [[179, 186], "Q145"], [[273, 280], "Q183"], [[306, 320], "Q458"], [[345, 361], "Unknown"], [[437, 444], "Q145"], [[580, 590], "Q8880"], [[610, 630], "Unknown"], [[769, 783], "Q458"], [[819, 821], "Unknown"], [[840, 854], "Q78587"], [[1011, 1019], "Unknown"], [[1029, 1036], "Unknown"], [[1065, 1072], "Q145"], [[1077, 1083], "Q142"], [[1138, 1170], "Unknown"], [[1173, 1176], "Q154666"], [[1204, 1212], "Unknown"], [[1253, 1255], "Unknown"], [[1416, 1423], "Q29"], [[1438, 1455], "Q255657"], [[1476, 1484], "Unknown"], [[1491, 1493], "Unknown"], [[1594, 1600], "Q142"], [[1605, 1612], "Q145"], [[1620, 1628], "Unknown"], [[1647, 1649], "Unknown"], [[1903, 1906], "Q154666"], [[1999, 2006], "Q145"], [[2117, 2123], "Q183"], [[2164, 2171], "Q145"], [[2210, 2216], "Q46"], [[2302, 2309], "Q183"], [[2322, 2352], "Unknown"], [[2355, 2358], "Unknown"], [[2370, 2386], "Unknown"], [[2395, 2404], "Unknown"], [[2407, 2411], "Q586"], [[2506, 2513], "Q145"], [[2621, 2628], "Q183"], [[2656, 2663], "Q145"], [[2737, 2744], "Q145"]]}

BONN 1996-08-22 Germany 's Agriculture Ministry suggested on Wednesday that consumers avoid eating meat from British sheep until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to the animals . \" Until this is cleared up by the European Union 's scientific panels -- and we have asked this to be done as quickly as possible -- ( consumers ) should if at all possible give preference to sheepmeat from other countries , \" ministry official Werner Zwingmann told ZDF television . \" I do not want to say that there is a concrete danger for consumers , \" he added . \" There are too many holes in what we know , and these must be filled very quickly . \" Bonn has led efforts to ensure consumer protection tops the list of priorities in dealing with the mad cow crisis , which erupted in March when Britain acknowledged humans could contract a similar illness by eating contaminated beef . The European Commission agreed this month to rethink a proposal to ban the use of suspect sheep tissue after some EU veterinary experts questioned whether it was justified . EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler had proposed banning sheep brains , spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains after reports from Britain and France that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy ( BSE ) -- mad cow disease . But some members of the EU 's standing veterinary committee questioned whether the action was necessary given the slight risk to human health . The question is being studied separately by two EU scientific committees . Sheep have long been known to contract scrapie , a similar brain-wasting disease to BSE which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste . British officials say sheep meat is perfectly safe to eat . ZDF said Germany imported 47,600 sheep from Britain last year , nearly half of total imports . It brought in 4,275 tonnes of British mutton , some 10 percent of overall imports . After the British government admitted a possible link between mad cow disease and its fatal human equivalent , the EU imposed a worldwide ban on British beef exports . EU leaders agreed at a summit in June to a progressive lifting of the ban as Britain takes parallel measures to eradicate the disease .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 2367], "labels": [[[0, 6], "Q183"], [[46, 53], "Q145"], [[63, 67], "Q586"], [[79, 86], "Q183"], [[90, 110], "Unknown"], [[172, 179], "Q145"], [[307, 321], "Q458"], [[518, 534], "Unknown"], [[540, 543], "Q48989"], [[728, 732], "Unknown"], [[872, 879], "Q145"], [[967, 986], "Q8880"], [[1077, 1079], "Unknown"], [[1137, 1139], "Unknown"], [[1158, 1172], "Q78587"], [[1291, 1298], "Q145"], [[1303, 1309], "Q142"], [[1364, 1396], "Unknown"], [[1399, 1402], "Q154666"], [[1450, 1452], "Unknown"], [[1618, 1620], "Unknown"], [[1729, 1732], "Q154666"], [[1825, 1832], "Q145"], [[1885, 1888], "Q48989"], [[1894, 1901], "Q183"], [[1929, 1936], "Q145"], [[2010, 2017], "Q145"], [[2074, 2081], "Q145"], [[2179, 2181], "Unknown"], [[2209, 2216], "Q145"], [[2232, 2234], "Unknown"], [[2309, 2316], "Q145"]]}

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "TENNIS - NEWCOMBE PONDERS HIS DAVIS CUP FUTURE . SYDNEY 1996-08-22 Australian Davis Cup captain John Newcombe on Thursday signalled his possible resignation if his team loses an away tie against Croatia next month . The former Wimbledon champion said the immediate future of Australia 's Davis Cup coach Tony Roche could also be determined by events in Split . \" If we lose this one , Tony and I will have to have a good look at giving someone else a go , \" Newcombe was quoted as saying in Sydney 's Daily Telegraph newspaper . Australia face Croatia in the world group qualifying tie on clay from September 20-22 . Under Newcombe 's leadership , Australia were relegated from the elite world group last year , the first time the 26-time Davis Cup winners had slipped from the top rank . Since taking over as captain from Neale Fraser in 1994 , Newcombe 's record in tandem with Roche , his former doubles partner , has been three wins and three losses . Newcombe has selected Wimbledon semifinalist Jason Stoltenberg , Patrick Rafter , Mark Philippoussis , and Olympic doubles champions Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde to face the Croatians . The home side boasts world number six Goran Ivanisevic , and Newcombe conceded his players would be hard-pressed to beat the Croatian number one . \" We are ready to fight to our last breath -- Australia must play at its absolute best to win , \" said Newcombe , who described the tie as the toughest he has faced as captain . Australia last won the Davis Cup in 1986 , but they were beaten finalists against Germany three years ago under Fraser 's guidance .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 1605], "labels": [[[9, 17], "Q312464"], [[30, 39], "Q132377"], [[49, 55], "Q3130"], [[67, 77], "Q408"], [[78, 87], "Q132377"], [[96, 109], "Q312464"], [[195, 202], "Q1276241"], [[227, 236], "Q41520"], [[275, 284], "Q408"], [[288, 297], "Q132377"], [[304, 314], "Q710119"], [[353, 358], "Q1663"], [[385, 389], "Q710119"], [[458, 466], "Q312464"], [[491, 497], "Q3130"], [[501, 516], "Q1819581"], [[529, 538], "Q782875"], [[544, 551], "Q1276241"], [[623, 631], "Q312464"], [[648, 657], "Q782875"], [[739, 748], "Q132377"], [[823, 835], "Q715173"], [[846, 854], "Q312464"], [[880, 885], "Q710119"], [[956, 964], "Q312464"], [[978, 987], "Q41520"], [[1001, 1018], "Q980620"], [[1021, 1035], "Q204068"], [[1038, 1056], "Q310949"], [[1063, 1070], "Q159821"], [[1089, 1104], "Q335312"], [[1109, 1123], "Q360630"], [[1136, 1145], "Unknown"], [[1186, 1202], "Q204279"], [[1209, 1217], "Q312464"], [[1273, 1281], "Unknown"], [[1341, 1350], "Q782875"], [[1398, 1406], "Q312464"], [[1473, 1482], "Q782875"], [[1496, 1505], "Q132377"], [[1555, 1562], "Q401869"], [[1585, 1591], "Q715173"]]}

With one out , Greer hit a 1-1 pitch from Julian Tavarez ( 4-7 ) over the right-field fence for his 15th home run . \" It was an off-speed pitch and I just tried to get a good swing on it and put it in play , \" Greer said . \" This was a big game . The crowd was behind him and it was intense . \" The shot brought home Ivan Rodriguez , who had his second double of the game , giving him 42 this season , 41 as a catcher . He joined Mickey Cochrane , Johnny Bench and Terry Kennedy as the only catchers with 40 doubles in a season . The Rangers have won 10 of their last 12 games and six of nine meetings against the Indians this season . The American League Western leaders have won eight of 15 games at Jacobs Field , joining the Yankees as the only teams with a winning record at the A.L. Central leaders ' home . Cleveland lost for just the second time in six games . The Indians sent the game into extra innings in the ninth on Kenny Lofton 's two-run single . Ed Vosberg ( 1-0 ) blew his first save opportunity but got the win , allowing three hits with two walks and three strikeouts in 1 2/3 scoreless innings .

In Baltimore , Cal Ripken had four hits and snapped a fifth-inning tie with a solo homer and Bobby Bonilla added a three-run shot in the seventh to power the surging Orioles to a 10-5 victory over the Seattle Mariners . The Mariners scored four runs in the top of the fifth to tie the game 5-5 but Ripken led off the bottom of the inning with his 21st homer off starter Sterling Hitchcock ( 12-6 ) . Bonilla 's blast was the first time Randy Johnson , last season 's Cy Young winner , allowed a run in five relief appearances since coming off the disabled list on August 6 . Bonilla has 21 RBI and 15 runs in his last 20 games . Baltimore has won seven of nine and 16 of its last 22 and cut the Yankees ' lead in the A.L. East to five games . Scott Erickson ( 8-10 ) laboured to his third straight win . Alex Rodriguez had two homers and four RBI for the Mariners , who have dropped three in a row and 11 of 15 . He became the fifth shortstop in major-league history to hit 30 homers in a season and the first since Ripken hit 34 in 1991 . Chris Hoiles hit his 22nd homer for Baltimore . In New York , Jason Dickson scattered 10 hits over 6 1/3 innings in his major-league debut and Chili Davis belted a homer from each side of the plate as the California Angels defeated the Yankees 7-1 . Dickson allowed a homer to Derek Jeter on his first major-league pitch but settled down . He was the 27th pitcher used by the Angels this season , tying a major-league record . Jimmy Key ( 9-10 ) took the loss as the Yankees lost their ninth in 14 games . They stranded 11 baserunners .

Bill Berkrot NEW YORK 1996-08-22 World number one Pete Sampras , seeking his first Grand Slam title of the year , and women 's top seed Steffi Graf , aiming for her third , should be able to ease into the year 's final major , which begins on Monday . Sampras opens the defence of his U.S. Open crown against David Rikl of the Czech Republic , while top-ranked Graf begins her title defence against Yayuk Basuki of Indonesia . Wednesday 's U.S. Open draw ceremony revealed that both title holders should run into their first serious opposition in the third round . Looming in Sampras 's future is a likely third-round date with recent nemesis Mark Philippoussis , the rising Australian who took out Sampras in the third round of the Australian Open in January . Sampras avenged that defeat with a straight sets win over the 19-year-old power hitter in the second round at Wimbledon and their rubber match in New York could provide some first-week fireworks . While only a stunning upset will keep Graf from sailing through to a predictable semifinal showdown with third seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario , the German star could also be tested in the third round where she will probably face 28th-ranked veteran Natasha Zvereva of Belarus . There will be no repeat of last year 's men 's final with eighth-ranked Andre Agassi landing in Sampras 's half of the draw . Bumping Agassi up to the sixth seeding avoided the possibility that he would run into Sampras as early as the quarter-finals , but they could lock horns in the semis . Olympic champion Agassi meets Karim Alami of Morocco in the first round . Surprise second seed Michael Chang , ranked third in the world , opens against Czech Daniel Vacek , while women 's second seed Monica Seles drew American Anne Miller as her first victim . Second-ranked Austrian Thomas Muster , who was seeded third , did not have the luck of the draw with him . In the first round Muster faces American Richey Reneberg , who has been playing some of the best tennis of his career of late . If he survives , Muster is seeded to run into either fifth-seeded Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands or 12th-seeded American Todd Martin in the quarter-finals in Chang 's half of the draw . Perhaps the best , yet most unfortunate , first-round matchup of the men 's competition pits eighth seed Jim Courier against retiring star Stefan Edberg . The popular Swede is playing his final major tournament next week and the two-time champion 's Grand Slam farewell could well be a one-match affair . With the exception of a Philippoussis showdown , Sampras looks to have landed in a comfortable quarter of the draw with the likes of Frenchman Cedric Pioline and ailing French Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov , who is nursing a rib injury , in his path . Seles , runner-up to Graf last year , is seeded to run into fifth-ranked German Anke Huber in the quarter-finals with fourth seed Conchita Martinez or eighth-seeded Olympic champion Lindsay Davenport looking like her most likely semifinal opponents . But Huber will be tested immediately with a first-round encounter against dangerous 18th-ranked South African Amanda Coetzer . Sanchez Vicario , runner-up to Graf at the French Open and Wimbledon , begins play against a qualifier in a quarter of the draw that includes young talent Martina Hingis , the 16th seed , before a probable quarter-final clash with seventh-seeded veteran Jana Novotna .

TORONTO 1996-08-21 Top-seeded Thomas Muster of Austria was beaten 6-3 7-5 by 123rd-ranked Daniel Nestor of Canada on Wednesday in his first match of the $ 2 million Canadian Open . A lefthander with a strong serve , Nestor kept the rallies short by constantly attacking the net and the tactic worked in the second-round match against Muster , playing his first match after receiving a first-round bye along with the other top eight seeds . The tournament also lost its second seed on the third day of play when second-seeded Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia was beaten 6-7(3-7 ) 6-4 6-4 by unseeded Mikael Tillstrom of Sweden . Other seeded players advancing were number three Wayne Ferreira of South Africa , number four Marcelo Rios of Chile , number six MaliVai Washington of the United States and American Todd Martin , the seventh seeed . Eighth seed Marc Rosset of Switzerland was eliminated in a one hour , 55 minute battle by unseeded Mark Philippoussis of Australia . Philippoussis saved a match point at 5-6 in the third-set tie break before winning 6-3 3-6 7-6 ( 8-6 ) . Philippoussis 's compatriot , 13th seed Jason Stoltenberg , was not as fortunate . He held one match point at 9-8 in a marathon third-set tie break but was beaten 5-7 7-6 ( 7-1 ) 7-6 ( 13-11 ) by unseeded Daniel Vacek of the Czech Republic . \" I knew I had to serve well and keep the points short and that 's what I was able to do , \" said Nestor , who ranks 10th in doubles . There were only two service breaks in the match . The lanky Canadian broke Muster at 4-3 in the first set and 5-5 in the second before ending the match on his third match point when the Austrian hit a service return long . \" I probably did n't hit five ground strokes in the whole match , \" said Muster , only partly joking . \" The way he was chipping and charging and serving and volleying I did n't really get my timing playing from the baseline . \" \" He played a good match , took a few chances , and every time he was down he was able to come up with a big first serve . \" Playing at night was not Muster 's preference . \" I asked for a day match and they gave me a night match , \" he said . \" I do n't like playing under the lights but maybe it would not have made any difference . \" Ivanisevic rallied from a 2-5 deficit in the first set but then played erratically against the 44th-ranked Tillstrom , who was a surprise winner over his famous compatriot Stefan Edberg in the second round at Wimbledon . Ivanisevic hit 32 aces but was outplayed from the back court by the 24-year-old Tillstrom . The sixth-ranked Ivanisevic , who lost in the final at Indianapolis to world number one Pete Sampras of the U.S. last Sunday , made a quick getaway after his loss but did say : \" Something was not there when I arrived ( in Toronto ) .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "Defiant U.S. neo-Nazi jailed by German court . Andrew Gray HAMBURG , Germany 1996-08-22 A Hamburg court sentenced U.S. neo-Nazi leader Gary Lauck on Thursday to four years in prison for pumping banned extremist propaganda into Germany from his base in the United States . Lauck , from Lincoln , Nebraska , yelled a tirade of abuse at the court after his conviction for inciting racial hatred . \" The struggle will go on , \" the 43-year-old shouted in German before being escorted out by security guards . Lauck 's lawyer vowed he would appeal against the court 's decision , arguing that his client should have been set free because he had not committed any offence under German law . The German government hailed the conviction as a major victory in the fight against neo-Nazism . Lauck 's worldwide network has been the main source of anti-Semitic propaganda material flowing into Germany since the 1970s . \" Lauck possessed a well-oiled propaganda machine , honed during more than 20 years , \" presiding judge Guenter Bertram told the court . \" He set up a propaganda cannon and fired it at Germany . \" said Bertram , who also read out extracts from Lauck 's material praising Hitler as \" the greatest of all leaders \" and describing the Nazi slaughter of millions of Jews as a myth . Eager to put Lauck behind bars quickly and avoid a long and complex trial , prosecutor Bernd Mauruschat limited his charges to offences since 1994 . He had demanded a five-year jail term but said he was satisfied with the court 's sentence . Publishing and distributing neo-Nazi material is illegal in Germany but Lauck 's defence team had argued that U.S freedom of speech laws meant he was free to produce his swastika-covered books , magazines , videos and flags in his homeland . Interior Minister Manfred Kanther said in a statement he \" welcomed the prosecution and conviction of one of the ringleaders of international neo-Nazism and biggest distributers of vicious racist publications \" . \" It is high time he was behind bars , \" the opposition Social Democrats said in a statement . Lauck , dressed in a sober blue suit and sporting his trademark Hitleresque black moustache , showed no sign of emotion as Bertram spent more than an hour reading out the verdict and explaining the court 's decision . But as Lauck was about to be led away , he turned to reporters and blurted out a virtually incomprehensible quick-fire diatribe against the court . \" Neither the National Socialists ( Nazis ) nor the communists dared to kidnap an American citizen , \" he shouted , in an oblique reference to his extradition to Germany from Denmark . \" That 's the truth . \" His attorney , Hans-Otto Sieg , told reporters outside the courtroom that the judges had not explained how a German court could judge someone for actions carried out in the United States . Bertram said Lauck was obsessed by Nazism and devoted his life to leading his National Socialist German Workers ' Party Foreign Organisation ( NSDAP-AO ) , which derives its name from the full German title of Hitler 's Nazi party . During the three-month trial , the court dealt mainly with issues of the NSDAP-AO 's \" NS Kampfruf \" ( \" National Socialist Battle Cry \" ) magazine , filled with references to Aryan supremacy and defamatory statements about Jews . The court rejected Sieg 's argument that Lauck 's extradition from Denmark , where he was arrested in March last year at the request of German authorities , was illegal . Lauck was also convicted of disseminating the symbols of anti-constitutional organisations . He will probably be free in around two and a half years . The court ruled that the 15 months he has spent in custody since his arrest should be subtracted from his prison term .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 3748], "labels": [[[8, 12], "Q30"], [[13, 21], "Unknown"], [[32, 38], "Q183"], [[47, 58], "Unknown"], [[59, 66], "Q1055"], [[69, 76], "Q183"], [[90, 97], "Q1055"], [[114, 118], "Q30"], [[119, 127], "Q151250"], [[135, 145], "Unknown"], [[227, 234], "Q183"], [[256, 269], "Q30"], [[272, 277], "Unknown"], [[285, 292], "Q28260"], [[295, 303], "Q1553"], [[451, 457], "Q188"], [[505, 510], "Unknown"], [[672, 678], "Q183"], [[689, 695], "Q183"], [[769, 779], "Q151250"], [[782, 787], "Unknown"], [[837, 849], "Unknown"], [[883, 890], "Q183"], [[911, 916], "Unknown"], [[1013, 1028], "Unknown"], [[1094, 1101], "Q183"], [[1111, 1118], "Unknown"], [[1153, 1158], "Unknown"], [[1180, 1186], "Q352"], [[1241, 1245], "Q7318"], [[1271, 1275], "Q7325"], [[1301, 1306], "Unknown"], [[1375, 1391], "Unknown"], [[1558, 1566], "Q151250"], [[1590, 1597], "Q183"], [[1602, 1607], "Unknown"], [[1640, 1643], "Q30"], [[1790, 1805], "Q492250"], [[1914, 1924], "Q151250"], [[2041, 2057], "Q49768"], [[2080, 2085], "Unknown"], [[2144, 2155], "Unknown"], [[2203, 2210], "Unknown"], [[2305, 2310], "Unknown"], [[2460, 2479], "Q7320"], [[2482, 2487], "Q7320"], [[2528, 2536], "Q30"], [[2608, 2615], "Q183"], [[2621, 2628], "Q35"], [[2670, 2684], "Unknown"], [[2764, 2770], "Q183"], [[2828, 2841], "Q30"], [[2844, 2851], "Unknown"], [[2857, 2862], "Unknown"], [[2879, 2885], "Q7310"], [[2922, 2984], "Unknown"], [[2987, 2995], "Unknown"], [[3037, 3043], "Q188"], [[3053, 3059], "Q352"], [[3063, 3067], "Q7318"], [[3149, 3157], "Q166269"], [[3163, 3174], "Unknown"], [[3181, 3210], "Unknown"], [[3252, 3257], "Q718909"], [[3300, 3304], "Q7325"], [[3326, 3330], "Unknown"], [[3348, 3353], "Unknown"], [[3374, 3381], "Q35"], [[3443, 3449], "Q183"], [[3478, 3483], "Unknown"]]}

They need our love and compassion . \" The diminutive Roman Catholic missionary was on respiratory support in intensive care in an Indian nursing home on Thursday after suffering heart failure . But an attending doctor said Mother Teresa , who turns 86 next Tuesday , was conscious and in stable condition . The task Mother Teresa began alone in 1949 in the slums of densely-populated Calcutta , and grew to touch the hearts of people around the world . When in 1979 she was told she had won the Nobel Peace Prize , she said characteristically : \" I am unworthy . \" The world disagreed , showering more than 80 national and international honours on her including the Bharat Ratna , or Jewel of India , the country 's highest civilian award . Her health began to deteriorate in 1989 when she was fitted with a heart pacemaker . A year later , the Vatican announced she was stepping down as Superior of her Missionaries of Charity order . More than 100 delegates flew in from around the world to elect a successor . They could not agree , so asked her to stay on . She agreed . In 1991 , Mother Teresa was treated at a California hospital for heart disease and bacterial pneumonia . In 1993 , she fell in Rome and broke three ribs . In August the same year , while in New Delhi to receive yet another award , she developed malaria , complicated by her heart and lung problems . Last April she fractured her left collar bone . But her increasing frailty , arthritis and failing eyesight has not stopped her travels around the world to mingle with the poor and desperate . Mother Teresa was born Agnes Goinxha Bejaxhiu to Albanian parents in Skopje , in what was then Serbia , on August 27 , 1910 . She attended a government school and was already deeply religious by the time she was 12 . At the age of 18 she became a Loretto nun , hoping to work at the Order 's Calcutta mission . She was sent to Loretto Abbey in Dublin and from there to India to begin her novitiate and teach geography at a convent school in Calcutta . She said her divine call to work among the poor came in September , 1946 . \" The message was quite clear , \" she told one interviewer . \" I was to leave the convent and help the poor while living among them . It was an order . I knew where I belonged . \" The Vatican and the mother superior in Dublin approved and after intensive training as a nurse with American missionaries she opened her first Calcutta slum school in December 1949 . She took the name of Teresa , after France 's Saint Therese of the Child Jesus . In India she was simply called Mother . Mother Teresa set up her first home for the dying in a Hindu rest house in Calcutta after she saw a penniless woman turned away by a city hospital . Named \" Nirmal Hriday \" ( Tender Heart ) , it was the first of a chain of 150 homes for dying , destitute people , admitting nearly 18,000 a year . Her Missionaries of Charity , a Roman Catholic religious order she founded in 1949 , now runs about 300 homes for unwanted children and the destitute in India and abroad .

It said moderating paper prices and solid orders for advertising at its Fox Broadcasting television network in the United States would also help boost profits in the 1996/97 year . \" A budgeted profit increase of at least 20 percent for the full year currently appears very attainable , \" News Corp said . The bullish comments for the coming year soothed analysts and most shareholders , who were disappointed by the lower than expected profit for 1995/96 . News announced pre-abnormals net profit for the year fell six percent to A$ 1.26 billion ( US$ 995 million ) and earnings per share dropped to 40 cents from 46 cents . Analysts had on average expected a pre-abnormals profit of A$ 1.343 billion . \" The year just gone was disappointing , but the outlook for the current year looks good , \" First Pacific media analyst Lachlan Drummond said .

Higher newsprint prices hit profits hard . \" Throughout the group , higher paper prices increased costs by over US$ 300 million , \" it said . News Corp said British newspaper operating profits rose 10 percent for the year , as higher cover prices at The Sun and The Times and higher advertising volumes offset increased newsprint costs . Advertising revenues at The Times grew 20 percent . Analysts said sharply lower earnings from News Corp 's book publishing division and its U.S. magazines had been the major surprises in the results for 1995/96 . News Corp said revenue gains at its magazines and inserts division were offset by higher paper prices and lower sales at the U.S. TV Guide . News said dramatically lower earnings from the British arm of its Harper-Collins publishing division more than offset healthy results from its U.S. operation . It said the demise of the Net Book Agreement had hurt the British operations , and weak performances from the San Francisco unit of Harper-Collins had not helped . The minimum price setting expired last September when three publishers pulled out . But it was the bullish profit forecast for 1996/97 that took the spotlight in the market , with some analysts saying 20 percent may even be an understatement . \" If they 're saying at least 20 percent , then their internal forecasts are probably saying 25 or 30 percent , \" said one Sydney media analyst who declined to be named .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "Ukraine hails peace as marks five-year independence . Rostislav Khotin KIEV 1996-08-23 Ukraine celebrates five years of independence from Kremlin rule on Saturday , hailing civil and inter-ethnic peace as its main post-Soviet achievement . Ukraine 's declaration of independence in 1991 , backed nine-to-one by a referendum in December of that year , effectively dealt a death blow to the Soviet empire and ended more than three centuries of rule from Moscow . Ukraine , with a Russian community of 11 million people -- the world 's largest outside Russia -- has avoided conflicts like those in Russia 's Chechnya , neighbouring Moldova , and the former Soviet republics of Georgia , Azerbaijan and Tajikistan . \" Ukraine 's biggest achievements for five years are the preservation of civil peace and inter-ethnic harmony , \" President Leonid Kuchma said in televised statement this week . \" Unlike many other post-Soviet countries we were able to deal with conflict situations in a peaceful and civilised way . \" But independence was initially accompanied by hyper-inflation and economic collapse , although there are signs of a turnaround . Inflation -- a hyper-inflationary 10,300 percent a year in 1993 -- was a respectable 0.1 percent a month in June and July and the economy has just begun to grow . Kuchma told a solemn ceremony at the Ukraina Palace on Friday that \" there was a turning point \" in reforms and that he expected a rise in the standard of living in the near future . \" There is no doubt that economic growth has already started , \" said Adelbert Knobl , head of the International Monetary Fund 's mission in Ukraine . \" The national bank and the government have every reason to be proud of their efforts . \" Central bank officials said on Thursday that a much-postponed hryvna currency would \" definitely \" be introduced before the end of this year . It will replace the interim karbovanets currency , which was introduced at par to the Russian rouble in 1992 but now trades at almost 33 karbovanets per rouble . Ukraine has repeatedly promised to introduce the hryvna but had to postpone the plans because of economic problems . Proud of its record in promptly joining both the Council of Europe and NATO 's Partnership for Peace , Ukraine caused a foreign policy wrangle this week , offending China by allowing a Taiwanese minister to appear on a public , if unofficial visit . China cancelled a visit by a top-level delegation in protest . Kiev 's Foreign Minister Hennady Udovenko said Beijing was overreacting . But Ukraine , seeing itself as a bridge between Russia and the rapidly Westernising countries of eastern Europe , is looking West as well as East . \" The strategic aim of European integration should not in any way damage Ukraine 's interests in post-Soviet areas . Relations with Russia , which is our main partner , have great importance , \" Kuchma said . \" But Ukraine cannot be economically oriented on Russia , even though those in some circles push us to do that . \" Kuchma has said Kiev wants membership of the European Union , associate membership of the Western European Union defence grouping and to move closer to NATO .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "Russia to clamp down on barter deals . MOSCOW 1996-08-23 Russian officials , keen to cut capital flight , will adopt tight measures to cut barter deals in foreign trade to a minimum , a customs official said on Friday . \" We have always been concerned about barter deals with other countries , viewing them as a disguised kind of capital flight from Russia , \" Marina Volkova , deputy head of the currency department at the State Customs Committee , told Reuters . Volkova said last year goods had been exported under many Russian barter deals , with nothing imported in return . She said the cost of such unimported goods was $ 1.10 billion in 1995 . Barter deals were worth $ 4.9 billion last year , or about eight percent of all Russian exports estimated at $ 61.5 billion , she said . \" The cost of exported goods is too often understated , so the actual share of barter deals in Russian exports and the amount of unimported goods may be even higher , \" Volkova said . A few days ago Russian President Boris Yeltsin issued a decree on state regulation of foreign barter deals , and Volkova said this \" could substantially improve the situation \" . In line with the decree , which will come into force on November 1 , all Russian barter traders will be obliged to import goods worth the cost of their exports within 180 days . \" If traders are late , they will have to pay fines worth the cost of their exported goods , \" Volkova said . Understating the cost of exported goods could still be a loophole for barter dealers , but Volkova said the authorities are currently \" tackling the technicalities of the issue \" . Barter has always been a feature of the Soviet Union 's foreign trade , but Yeltsin 's decrees liberalising foreign trade in 1991-1992 has given barter a new impetus . A few years ago , barter deals accounted for up to 25-30 percent of Russian exports because \" thousands ( of ) trade companies which popped up preferred barter in the absence of reliable Russian banks and money transfer systems \" , Volkova said . \" Now many Russian banks are strong and can make various sorts of money tranfers , while incompetent traders are being ousted by more experienced ones .

The 20-year-old Rubin , who was to be seeded 11th , is still suffering from tendinitis of the right wrist that has kept her sidelined in recent months . Rubin 's misfortune turned into a very lucky break for eighth-seeded Olympic champion Lindsay Davenport . Davenport had drawn one of the toughest first-round assignments of any of the seeded players in 17th-ranked Karina Habsudova of Slovakia . But as the highest-ranked non-seeded player in the tournament , Habsudova will be moved into Rubin 's slot in the draw , while Davenport will now get a qualifier in the first round , according to U.S. Tennis Association officials . Rubin is the third notable withdrawal from the women 's competition after 12th-ranked former Australian Open champion Mary Pierce and 20th-ranked Wimbledon semifinalist Meredith McGrath pulled out earlier this week with injuries .

BALTIMORE 1996-08-22 Former Oriole Jamie Moyer allowed two hits over eight scoreless innings before tiring in the ninth and Paul Sorrento added his third grand slam of the season as the Seattle Mariners routed Baltimore 10-3 Thursday . Moyer ( 10-2 ) , who was tagged for a pair of homers by Mike Devereaux and Brady Anderson and three runs in the ninth , walked none and struck out two . Norm Charlton retired the final three batters to seal the victory . With one out in the fifth Ken Griffey Jr and Edgar Martinez stroked back-to-back singles off Orioles starter Rocky Coppinger ( 7-5 ) and Jay Buhner walked . Sorrento followed by hitting a 1-2 pitch just over the right-field wall for a 7-0 advantage . Right fielder Bobby Bonilla was after the ball , which was touched by fans at the top of the scoreboard in right . \" Things fell in for us , \" said Sorrento , who has six career grand slams and hit the ninth of the season for the Mariners . \" We have over a month left . We 've got to make up some ground . \" In the American League wild-card race , the Mariners are three games behind the White Sox , two behind Baltimore and two ahead of the Red Sox heading into Boston for a weekend series . Moyer retired 11 straight batters between the third and seventh innings and threw two or fewer pitches to 11 of the 29 batters he faced . \" I made some bad pitches at the end but I 'm not going to dwell on it . We won the game , \" said Moyer . Coppinger ( 7-5 ) was tagged for eight runs and 10 hits in 4 1/3 innings . Orioles manager Davey Johnson missed the game after being admitted to a hospital with an irregular heartbeat . Bench coach Andy Etchebarren took his place . In Boston , Troy O'Leary homered off the right-field foul pole with one out in the bottom of the ninth and the Red Sox climbed to the .500 mark for the first time this season with their fourth straight victory , 2-1 over the Oakland Athletics . Boston has won 15 of its last 19 games . Boston 's Roger Clemens ( 7-11 ) was one out away from his second straight shutout when pinch-hitter Matt Stairs tripled over the head of centre fielder Lee Tinsley on an 0-2 pitch and pinch-hitter Terry Steinbach dunked a broken-bat single into right to lift Oakland into a 1-1 tie . The run broke Clemens ' 28-inning shutout streak , longest in the majors this season . He pitched his fourth complete game , allowing eight hits with two walks and 11 strikeouts . Reliever Mark Acre ( 0-1 ) took the loss . In New York , Garret Anderson and Gary DiSarcina drove in two runs apiece in a five-run first inning and Jim Edmonds highlighted a six-run sixth with a bases-loaded double as the California Angels coasted to a 12-3 victory over the Yankees in the rubber game of their three-game series . The Angels battered Kenny Rogers ( 10-7 ) for five runs in the first . The Yankees have allowed at least two runs in the first inning in six straight games , getting outscored 21-1 in the first inning in that span . Chuck Finley ( 12-12 ) snapped a four-game losing streak . In Kansas City , Travis Fryman doubled in the go-ahead run in the fifth and Melvin Nieves and Damion Easley belted two-run homers as the Detroit Tigers claimed a 10-3 win over the Royals , handing them their fifth straight loss .

He has yielded just seven runs in his last four starts , covering 33 1/3 innings . In Chicago , Erik Hanson outdueled Alex Fernandez , and Jacob Brumfield drove in Otis Nixon with the game 's only run in the sixth inning as the Toronto Blue Jays blanked the White Sox 1-0 in a game shortened to six innings due to rain .

Adrian Warner BRUSSELS 1996-08-23 American Dennis Mitchell upstaged a trio of past and present Olympic 100 metres champions on Friday with a storming victory at the Brussels grand prix . Sporting his customary bright green outfit , the U.S. champion clocked 10.03 seconds despite damp conditions to take the scalp of Canada 's reigning Olympic champion Donovan Bailey , 1992 champion Linford Christie of Britain and American 1984 and 1988 champion Carl Lewis . Mitchell also beat world and Olympic champion Bailey at the most lucrative meeting in the sport in Zurich last week . The American , who finished fourth at the Atlanta Games , was fast out of his blocks and held off Bailey 's late burst in the final 20 metres before heading off for a lap of celebration . The Canadian was second in 10.09 with Lewis third in 10.10 , ahead of Atlanta bronze medallist Ato Boldon who clocked 10.12 in fourth . Christie , competing in what is expected to be his last major international meeting , finished fifth in 10.14 . Lewis , making a rare appearance in Europe in a sprint race , left the track with a slight limp . American Olympic high hurdles champion Allen Johnson defied the wet conditions to produce a brilliant 12.92 seconds in the 110 metres race , just 0.01 outside the world record held by Britain 's Colin Jackson . Johnson ran the same time at the U.S. Olympic trials in Atlanta in June to become the second equal fastest hurdler of all time with American Roger Kingdom . He seemed to relish the new track at the Brussels meeting , dominating the race from start to finish with a slight wind at his back . Jackson , the only man to have run faster , could not live with his speed , taking second in 13.24 seconds . The rain was pelting down when the women 's high hurdlers stepped up for their 100 metres race . But Sweden 's Olympic high hurdles champion Ludmila Engquist , who crashed out of last week 's meeting in Zurich after hitting a hurdle , also kept her footing perfectly to win in a fast 12.60 seconds . Olympic silver medallist Brigita Bukovec of Slovenia could finish only fifth in the race in 12.95 . Jamaican Commonwealth champion Michelle Freeman took second in 12.77 ahead of Cuban Aliuska Lopez . The Zurich fall cost Engquist a shot at a jackpot of 20 one-kg gold bars which can be won by athletes who clinch their events at all of the Golden Four series in Oslo , Zurich , Brussels and Berlin . Seven athletes went into Friday 's penultimate meeting of the series with a chance of winning the prize and American men 's 400 metres hurdles champion Derrick Adkins kept his hopes alive in the competition by winning his event in 47.93 . American Olympic champion Gail Devers clocked a swift 10.84 seconds on her way to victory in the women 's 100 metres , the second fastest time of the season and 0.10 seconds faster than her winning time in Atlanta . Jamaican veteran Merlene Ottey , who beat Devers in Zurich after just missing out on the gold medal in Atlanta after a photo finish , had to settle for third place in 11.04 . American world champion Gwen Torrence , the bronze medallist in Atlanta , was second in 11.00 . It was a costly defeat for Ottey since it threw her out of the race for the Golden Four jackpot .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 3312], "labels": [[[12, 20], "Q733721"], [[38, 45], "Q8531"], [[65, 78], "Unknown"], [[79, 87], "Q240"], [[99, 107], "Q30"], [[108, 123], "Q733721"], [[160, 167], "Q159821"], [[230, 238], "Q240"], [[252, 260], "Unknown"], [[301, 305], "Q30"], [[382, 388], "Q16"], [[401, 408], "Q159821"], [[418, 432], "Q311048"], [[449, 465], "Q310019"], [[469, 476], "Q145"], [[481, 489], "Q30"], [[513, 523], "Q131237"], [[526, 534], "Q733721"], [[555, 562], "Q159821"], [[572, 578], "Q311048"], [[625, 631], "Q72"], [[648, 656], "Unknown"], [[686, 699], "Q8531"], [[742, 748], "Q311048"], [[836, 844], "Unknown"], [[870, 875], "Q131237"], [[902, 909], "Q8531"], [[927, 937], "Q311366"], [[968, 976], "Q310019"], [[1080, 1085], "Q131237"], [[1116, 1122], "Q46"], [[1178, 1194], "Unknown"], [[1217, 1230], "Q311725"], [[1362, 1369], "Q145"], [[1373, 1386], "Q311300"], [[1389, 1396], "Q311725"], [[1422, 1426], "Q30"], [[1427, 1434], "Q159821"], [[1445, 1452], "Q23556"], [[1521, 1529], "Q30"], [[1530, 1543], "Q354324"], [[1587, 1595], "Q240"], [[1680, 1687], "Q311300"], [[1890, 1896], "Q34"], [[1900, 1907], "Q159821"], [[1930, 1946], "Q240424"], [[1992, 1998], "Q72"], [[2089, 2096], "Q159821"], [[2114, 2129], "Q271356"], [[2133, 2141], "Q215"], [[2189, 2197], "Q766"], [[2198, 2210], "Q178340"], [[2220, 2236], "Q290774"], [[2267, 2272], "Q241"], [[2273, 2286], "Q181644"], [[2293, 2299], "Q72"], [[2310, 2318], "Q240424"], [[2429, 2440], "Unknown"], [[2451, 2455], "Q585"], [[2458, 2464], "Q72"], [[2467, 2475], "Q240"], [[2480, 2486], "Q64"], [[2597, 2605], "Q30"], [[2641, 2655], "Q503107"], [[2728, 2744], "Unknown"], [[2754, 2765], "Q217354"], [[2934, 2941], "Q8531"], [[2944, 2952], "Q766"], [[2961, 2974], "Q217358"], [[2986, 2992], "Q217354"], [[2996, 3002], "Q72"], [[3047, 3054], "Q8531"], [[3119, 3127], "Q30"], [[3143, 3156], "Q231991"], [[3183, 3190], "Q8531"], [[3242, 3247], "Q217358"], [[3291, 3302], "Unknown"]]}

The club , founded in 1961 , has a loyal following in Taibe , an Arab town of 28,000 in the heart of Israel . But away from their home ground , they face unfriendly crowds who taunt the players with racist abuse . \" The very first thing we thought about after we knew we would be promoted was the game against Betar Jerusalem , \" said Taibe supporter Karem Haj Yihye .

Adel Ibrahim , the Iraqi embassy 's press attache , was asked to leave \" because he was carrying out duties incompatible with diplomatic norms \" , one source told Reuters , implying he was accused of spying . Ibrahim told Reuters by telephone from his embassy office in Amman that he \" had not been notified \" of any explusion order . The government declined official comment . Ibrahim 's assistant , Hussein Khalaf , was expelled earlier this year for similar reasons amid rising tension in bilateral ties after King Hussein began calling for change in Baghdad following top Iraqi defections in August 1995 . Iraq retaliated then by expelling a junior administrator working in the Jordanian embassy in Baghdad but has continued its policy of trying to avoid public conflicts with Jordan -- its only secure route to the rest of the world . Jordan has accused Iraq and a local pro-Baghdad party for the country 's worst unrest in seven years which erupted after it almost doubled the prices of bread last week under radical economic reforms agreed with the International Monetary Fund . In Karak , where two days of riots flared last Friday , a few hundred young men lingered outside Omari mosque on leaving , shouting slogans for about 15 minutes . \" Disperse , abstain from forming groups and help maintain order , \" army officers , who has enforced a loose curfew since the riots , told the crowd through loudspeakers .

In addition to Disney , Americast 's partners are phone companies Ameritech Corp. , BellSouth Corp. , GTE Corp. and SBC Communications . Americast said Southern New England Telecommunications Corp. has signed a letter of intent to join the group , which plans to provide a home entertainment service similar to cable television . Zenith also said it planned to build a new $ 100 million plant in Woodridge , Ill . , to make picture tubes for 32- and 35-inch screen TV sets . The company currently buys the tubes from competitors . The new plant , which is dependent on obtaining financing , will create about 280 new jobs , Zenith said . The contract calls for production of the set-top boxes over five years . Luehrs said manufacturing will begin and revenue will start to roll in during the first half of next year . The boxes will be made on a build-to-order basis . Zenith will convert its Chihuahua , Mexico , analogue set-top box plant to manufacture the digital boxes . Luehrs declined to say when the operation was expected to be profitable . Americast will provide the boxes to subscribers as part of the service . Its service is being introduced in selected markets across the United States . Luehrs said digital technology in set-top boxes is only the beginning and said the technology will eventually show up in retail consumer electronics . \" We 'll build a lot of these devices into television sets , for digital television , \" he said . \" Although that is not where this particular contract is headed , the fact that there is a strong Zenith presence will pay us dividends in the future . \" Zenith has been plagued by generally soft conditions in the colour television industry , reporting full-year losses since 1989 .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "Huge Windows 95 sales fail to meet expectations . Martin Wolk SEATTLE 1996-08-22 A year after its massively publicized introduction , Microsoft Corp. 's Windows 95 computer operating system has fallen short of the most optimistic expectations for the software giant and the industry . Even though more than 40 million copies of Windows 95 have been sold , making it the fastest-selling new software ever , it would have been impossible for any product to live up to the unprecedented hype of the Aug. 24 , 1995 launch , when stores around the world opened at midnight to greet long lines of customers . The Redmond , Wash.-based company spent tens of millions of dollars promoting the product with stunts that included buying the entire print run of the Times of London and lighting New York 's Empire State building in a Windows color scheme . But the product , delivered eight months late , has fallen short of its sales potential in part because Microsoft delivered a mixed message to business customers , analysts said . \" It did n't do as well as it could have , \" said Rob Enderle , an analyst with Giga Information Group . Scores of software and hardware companies that had hoped for a big boost in sales were disappointed when only a brief spike materialized . \" People who were expecting major coat-tails were somewhat disappointed , \" said Scott Winkler , an analyst with Gartner Group . \" It 's not as though it has n't had an impact , \" he said . \" It just has n't had the huge earth-shattering impact some people were looking for . \" Symantec Corp. , which had been among the most bullish of software companies at the time of the Windows 95 launch , ended up posting disappointing financial results when retail sales of the operating system fell short of its projections . Touchstone Software Corp. had to pay $ 1.3 million in cash and stock to settle a shareholders lawsuit brought after the company 's sales failed to meet expectations tied to the Windows 95 launch . Many software developers apparently saw their crucial holiday season sales suffer last year because store shelves were jammed with blue-and-white boxes of Windows 95 , resulting in a shortage of space for seasonal products , said Ann Stephens , president of PC Data Inc . To be sure , sales of Windows 95 and the accompanying Office 95 upgrade drove Microsoft sales up 46 percent last year to a record $ 8.67 billion and cemented the company 's status as the industry 's dominant company . Microsoft executives say they are thrilled with the sales figures , and industry analysts estimate that by sometime next year , the installed base of Windows 95 will surpass that of the older version of Windows , now used on about 100 million computers worldwide . But Enderle said the figure could have been even higher if Microsoft had done a better job of handling the huge demand for technical support from customers who were frustrated trying to install the system . He and other analysts said corporate America adopted a go-slow approach because Microsoft already was promoting the new version of its high-end Windows NT operating system , expected to be available in stores in the next several weeks . \" Microsoft sent a lot of signals that NT was going to be the answer , \" Winkler said . \" Many people began to believe that Windows 95 was being downplayed . \" But now that Windows NT 4.0 has been launched , Winkler and others believe only a relatively small proportion of corporate users will elect to pay the added software and hardware costs needed to use it instead of Windows 95 . \" Windows 95 is going to do great , \" he said . \" The mistake people made was in thinking it was going to be a fast , sweeping change rather than a slow , building change . \"", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 3742], "labels": [[[5, 15], "Q83370"], [[50, 61], "Unknown"], [[62, 69], "Q5083"], [[134, 149], "Q2283"], [[153, 163], "Q83370"], [[328, 338], "Q83370"], [[607, 614], "Q223718"], [[617, 628], "Unknown"], [[754, 769], "Q50008"], [[783, 791], "Q60"], [[795, 807], "Q9188"], [[822, 829], "Q1406"], [[949, 958], "Q2283"], [[1075, 1086], "Q7340114"], [[1105, 1127], "Unknown"], [[1350, 1363], "Unknown"], [[1382, 1395], "Q174198"], [[1547, 1561], "Unknown"], [[1643, 1653], "Q83370"], [[1786, 1811], "Unknown"], [[1963, 1973], "Q83370"], [[2138, 2148], "Q83370"], [[2213, 2225], "Unknown"], [[2241, 2252], "Unknown"], [[2277, 2287], "Q83370"], [[2309, 2318], "Unknown"], [[2333, 2342], "Q2283"], [[2473, 2482], "Q2283"], [[2623, 2633], "Q83370"], [[2676, 2683], "Q1406"], [[2742, 2749], "Q7340114"], [[2797, 2806], "Q2283"], [[2982, 2989], "Q30"], [[3025, 3034], "Q2283"], [[3089, 3099], "Q486487"], [[3184, 3193], "Q2283"], [[3221, 3223], "Unknown"], [[3255, 3262], "Unknown"], [[3306, 3316], "Q83370"], [[3355, 3369], "Q488978"], [[3390, 3397], "Unknown"], [[3555, 3565], "Q83370"], [[3570, 3580], "Q83370"]]}

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "China copper stocks owned by state reserve - trade . Lynne O'Donnell HONG KONG 1996-08-23 Up to 100,000 tonnes of copper held in Shanghai bonded warehouses , confounding the world market as to its source and ultimate fate , probably belongs to China 's strategic state reserve , industry sources said on Friday . Around 40,000 tonnes of the copper have already been moved to warehouses near the northern port of Yingkou , where some of the strategic stockpile was stored , they said . Just who owns the copper is a question that has kept traders and industry analysts guessing since the metal was channelled into Shanghai by the China National Nonferrous Metals Import and Export Corp ( CNIEC ) in June and July . It was unclear whether or not the 40,000 tonnes had cleared customs -- which would provide some concrete indication that the strategic reserve , administered directly by the central government 's State Planning Commission , owned the copper . Traders have said the reserve could negotiate concessions on duties -- three percent import tax and 17 percent value-added tax -- that made the copper prohibitively expensive otherwise . But one source , the head of a Hong Kong trading house , said it made no difference if the copper was customs cleared or not . \" If they spend all this money moving the copper to Yingkou , it will be sitting there for years , \" he said . \" Once it arrives in Yingkou , it is subject to monitoring by the State Planning Commission , which has to give permission for any more movement ; it is out of the hands of traders , \" he said . Mystery has surrounded the Shanghai stockpile in recent months , with traders unsure not only of who owns it , but of its exact size and what its owner planned to do with it . Trading sources generally agreed it would be cost-effective to take the copper back into a depleted central reserve as it had already served its purpose in taking advantage of long-term backwardation on the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) . A backwardation occurs when the spot price of a metal is higher than the forward price . CNIEC lent around 85,000 tonnes of copper onto the LME between April and June 1995 on behalf of the state reserve , running the state stockpile down to 115,000 tonnes from 200,000 tonnes previously . Traders in Asia said CNIEC could well have lent it to the market at around US$ 2,700 a tonne , and then paid somewhere between $ 2,200 and $ 2,400 a tonne when it started taking the metal back earlier this year . This would have cleared CNIEC a healthy profit , which could then have been used to finance storage and other costs . Word that CNIEC had offered the copper to European trading houses in a series of secret meetings unnerved an already jittery market . Industry analysts Bloomsbury Minerals Economics ( BME ) said on Wednesday the motivation of the owners of the 85,000 tonnes , \" whoever they are , is the most important short-term fundamental \" in an already tight world market . BME repeated in its latest review rumours of involvement by Sumitomo Corp , with CNIEC said to be helping the Japanese trader unload its copper positions after it revealed in June losses of $ 1.8 billion in a decade of unauthorised deals . Sumitomo and CNIEC have made no comments on the talk and Chinese traders said they know nothing of such an arrangement . Traders in Shanghai said on Thursday they were unaware of movements out of the Shanghai bonded warehouses . They reported more arrivals that were probably spot purchases .

LONDON 1996-08-24 Essex are set to step up their English county championship challenge with a fifth consecutive victory after new-ball pair Neil Williams and Mark Ilott sent Gloucestershire reeling on Saturday . Williams seized two wickets in two deliveries and left-armer Ilott also captured two as Gloucestershire , 252 behind on first innings , slumped to 27 for four at the close on the third day of the four-day game at Colchester . Essex , who started the current round of matches in fifth place 20 points behind leaders Derbyshire with a game in hand , could go top if they complete victory on Monday 's last day and other results favour them . Williams thrust Essex on course for success by dispatching Matt Windows and Andrew Symonds in his second over , before Ilott removed Dominic Hewson and Tim Hancock to reduce Gloucestershire to 17 for four at one stage . The visitors had started the day optimistically by sending back former England captain Graham Gooch when he added just six to his overnight 105 , but Essex went on to make 532 for eight before declaring . Captain Paul Prichard plundered 88 from 73 deliveries , hitting 15 fours and one six . Second-placed Kent were frustrated by rain which prevented any play at Cardiff , where they have reached 255 for three in their first innings against Glamorgan , while third-placed Surrey are facing an uphill task against Nottinghamshire . Surrey slipped to 88 for four in reply to Notts ' commanding first innings of 446 for nine declared at Trent Bridge , before Alistair Brown struck a 55-ball half-century . Brown 's 56 not out , containing eight fours and three sixes , lifted Surrey to 128 for four on a rain-curtailed day . Fourth-placed Leicestershire had Hampshire on the ropes at Leicester before rain intervened . Pace trio David Millns ( 2-24 ) , Gordon Parsons ( 3-20 ) and Vince Wells ( 2-19 ) had Hampshire reeling at 81 for seven in reply to the home county 's first innings of 353 . Yorkshire rekindled their title hopes after three successive defeats by taking the upper hand against arch-rivals Lancashire at Old Trafford . Facing Yorkshire 's 529 for eight declared , Lancashire were forced to follow on 206 behind after being bowled out for 323 , paceman Darren Gough polishing off the innings with a burst of three wickets for one run in 17 deliveries . Lancashire then reached 210 for five at the close -- just four ahead -- after Neil Fairbrother hit 55 in 60 balls to add to his first innings of 86 .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 2541], "labels": [[[10, 15], "Q3058749"], [[52, 58], "Q84"], [[70, 75], "Q3058749"], [[101, 108], "Q21"], [[192, 205], "Q6840278"], [[210, 220], "Q6768180"], [[226, 241], "Q2735265"], [[264, 272], "Unknown"], [[325, 330], "Q6768180"], [[352, 367], "Q2735265"], [[477, 487], "Q184163"], [[490, 495], "Q3058749"], [[579, 589], "Q1788018"], [[704, 712], "Unknown"], [[720, 725], "Q3058749"], [[763, 775], "Unknown"], [[780, 794], "Q2723418"], [[823, 828], "Q6768180"], [[837, 851], "Q5290552"], [[856, 867], "Q7803594"], [[878, 893], "Q2735265"], [[995, 1002], "Q1321565"], [[1011, 1023], "Q1541932"], [[1074, 1079], "Q3058749"], [[1137, 1150], "Q7153012"], [[1230, 1234], "Q3195284"], [[1287, 1294], "Q10690"], [[1366, 1375], "Q3107254"], [[1397, 1403], "Q2725632"], [[1438, 1453], "Q3344790"], [[1456, 1462], "Q2725632"], [[1498, 1503], "Q3344790"], [[1559, 1571], "Q2096399"], [[1581, 1595], "Q4724726"], [[1628, 1633], "Q4724726"], [[1698, 1704], "Q2725632"], [[1761, 1775], "Q3229147"], [[1780, 1789], "Q3126578"], [[1806, 1815], "Q83065"], [[1851, 1863], "Q5237579"], [[1875, 1889], "Q11776223"], [[1903, 1914], "Q6827610"], [[1928, 1937], "Q3126578"], [[2016, 2025], "Q3177444"], [[2130, 2140], "Q2725657"], [[2144, 2156], "Q1572215"], [[2166, 2175], "Q3177444"], [[2204, 2214], "Q2725657"], [[2292, 2304], "Q1166623"], [[2392, 2402], "Q2725657"], [[2470, 2486], "Q12985273"]]}

Elsewhere , title hopefuls Liverpool were held 0-0 at home by newly-promoted Sunderland , and in London , the tie between Tottenham Hotspur and Everton also ended goaless .

But they left gaps at the back and on 73 minutes Danish striker Jon Dahl Tomasson rushed out of his own half , beat the Ajax defence and lobbed van der Sar .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "Clinton campaign busy making \" news \" . Laurence McQuillan WASHINGTON 1996-08-24 President Bill Clinton has served notice he intends to be busy \" making news \" -- or at least doing things that look and sound like it in a campaign year . With Democrats gathering in Chicago to start a convention on Monday to nominate him for a second term as president , Clinton plans a steady parade of events designed to highlight his leadership and dim the glow of the just-concluded Republican conclave that gave a boost to rival Bob Dole . After a week of carefully orchestrated events signing into law bills passed by the Republican-controlled Congress , Clinton used his Saturday radio address to the nation to proudly \" announce \" a development in the war on crime . \" Sixty days ago I directed the attorney general to draw up a plan for a national registry of sex offenders , \" Clinton said . \" That plan has now reached my desk . \" \" Today I am pleased to announce that we are following through on our commitment to keep track of these criminals , not just in a single state but wherever they go , \" he said . Actually , creation of such a registry was underway without Clinton lifting a finger . Attorney General Janet Reno 's report -- all nine pages of it , including footnotes -- offers only the interim services of the FBI until a formal registry on sex offenders has been established . Two months ago , Clinton announced he wanted an interim effort established . Now , 60 days later , he had a chance to talk about it again . It is an example of Clinton 's strategic planning as he heads into the stretch drive for the Nov. 5 presidential election . Such things do not happen by chance in the Clinton White House , they are part of his political chess game . In the past week Clinton signed into law an increase in the minimium wage , a bill that makes it easier for someone with a pre-existing health problem to change jobs , and sweeping changes overhauling the nation 's welfare system . \" America can look back on a week of remarkable achievement , \" Clinton said , without even a passing reference to the Republican majority in the House and Senate . \" America is on the right track offering more opportunity , demanding more responsibility , building a stronger community , the sense of shared values and stronger families , \" he said in striking the theme of his coming week . According to a senior campaign official , Clinton \" will be making a lot of news in the coming week -- something different each day . \" Clinton departs on Sunday on a four-day train trip through West Virginia , Kentucky , Ohio , Michigan and Indiana while fellow Democrats are gathered in Chicago . \" He 'll make news during the day ... and then at night the attention will go to the convention , \" said the campaign official . \" We think it 'll work really well . \" Although officials decline to say just what each day 's \" news \" will be , the intent is to put a focus on Clinton himself and not just those attending the party 's convention . Each day of the trip will have a late start , so that network television correspondents will be able to do live reports for morning programmes . Campaign officials then hope the day 's \" news \" event will be showcased on evening television news shows as a lead-in for that night 's convention programme . \" We 'll be concentrating ... on supporting the president as he is on the trip and making significant public policy statements related to some of his plans for the future , \" said White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry . McCurry said that when Clinton delivers his acceptance address on Thursday night to fellow Democrats and a national television audience , he will \" set out a road map \" for the nation 's future -- one the president hopes guides him back to the White House for four more years .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 3833], "labels": [[[0, 7], "Q1124"], [[40, 58], "Unknown"], [[59, 69], "Q61"], [[91, 103], "Q1124"], [[242, 251], "Q29552"], [[265, 272], "Q1297"], [[354, 361], "Q1124"], [[470, 480], "Q29468"], [[517, 525], "Q319079"], [[611, 632], "Unknown"], [[633, 641], "Q11268"], [[644, 651], "Q1124"], [[870, 877], "Q1124"], [[1163, 1170], "Q1124"], [[1207, 1217], "Q236421"], [[1317, 1320], "Q8333"], [[1402, 1409], "Q1124"], [[1545, 1552], "Q1124"], [[1692, 1699], "Q1124"], [[1700, 1711], "Q35525"], [[1775, 1782], "Q1124"], [[1992, 1999], "Q30"], [[2054, 2061], "Q1124"], [[2109, 2119], "Q29468"], [[2136, 2141], "Unknown"], [[2146, 2152], "Unknown"], [[2157, 2164], "Q30"], [[2425, 2432], "Q1124"], [[2519, 2526], "Q1124"], [[2578, 2591], "Q1371"], [[2594, 2602], "Q1603"], [[2605, 2609], "Q1397"], [[2612, 2620], "Q1166"], [[2625, 2632], "Q1415"], [[2646, 2655], "Q29552"], [[2672, 2679], "Q1297"], [[2957, 2964], "Q1124"], [[3513, 3524], "Q35525"], [[3541, 3553], "Q6847909"], [[3556, 3563], "Unknown"], [[3579, 3586], "Q1124"], [[3647, 3656], "Q29552"], [[3800, 3811], "Q35525"]]}

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "Belgium asks how paedophile suspect eluded police . Jeremy Lovell BRUSSELS 1996-08-24 Belgian police searched two more houses on Saturday for bodies in a child-sex scandal of murder , kidnapping and pornography that has sent a shockwave of revulsion throughout Europe . Recriminations built up over how the scandal 's central figure , convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux , managed to prey on children unhindered for so long . In just over a week two young girls have been found dead , from starvation , two have been freed from a dungeon-like secret compartment and an international hunt has started for at least two others . On Saturday investigators with dogs trained to find bodies searched one house at Ransart and one at Mont-sur-Marchienne -- both suburbs of the southern city of Charleroi . Both houses are owned by Dutroux . Belgian media speculated that Dutroux , charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment of children , must have had high level protection to molest youngsters . They put forward no proof to support the speculation , but seized on a comment by chief prosecutor Michel Bourlet on Belgian television on Friday night that he would chase down everyone involved in the case \" if I am allowed to \" . Bourlet said between 300 and 400 paedophile porn video tapes had been seized , some of which featured Dutroux . Dutroux was charged a week ago after police rescued two young girls from a concrete dungeon in the basement of one of the six houses he owns in and around Charleroi . Just a day later the national euphoria at the rescue turned to disgust as Dutroux led police to the bodies of two eight-year-old girls in another of his houses . Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo , had been kidnapped in June last year . Dutroux said they starved to death nine months later . He also admitted kidnapping two other girls , An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks , a year ago . The fate of the girls is unknown , but there has been speculation they were sold into prostitution in Slovakia or the Czech Republic where Dutroux was a frequent visitor . Belgian police have visited Bratislava and will visit Prague . Five other people have been arrested including Dutroux 's second wife Michelle Martin , charged as an accomplice . The others have been charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment of children or are suspected of criminal association . Dutch police are also holding a 74-year old Dutchman in connection with the disappearance of An and Eefje , although a spokesman said no direct link had yet been established . At least part of the speculation in the Belgian media of high-level protection for Dutroux and his accomplices is based on leaked documents cataloguing a high degree of police bungling , incompetence and indifference . Among the revelations are the fact that the gendarmerie was running a surveillance operation codenamed \" Othello \" against Dutroux in 1995 -- when both Julie and Melissa and An and Eefje were kidnapped . They show that the gendarmes were aware that Dutroux was building cells in some of his houses for holding children , yet this information was either not passed on to other police forces searching for the missing girls or was overlooked when it was . They also show that police investigating a theft visited Dutroux late last year at the house where Julie and Melissa were being held but accepted his word that the children 's cries they could hear came from neighbours . Justice Minister Stefaan De Clerck has admitted that mistakes were made and ordered an inquiry at the same time as stressing there were no indications of a cover-up . There is also widespread disbelief that no one appeared to question how Dutroux , an unemployed father of three with no visible means of support , managed to own six houses .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 3772], "labels": [[[0, 7], "Q31"], [[52, 65], "Unknown"], [[66, 74], "Q240"], [[86, 93], "Q31"], [[261, 267], "Q46"], [[358, 370], "Q32484"], [[707, 714], "Unknown"], [[726, 745], "Q843323"], [[786, 795], "Q81046"], [[823, 830], "Q32484"], [[833, 840], "Q31"], [[863, 870], "Q32484"], [[1093, 1107], "Unknown"], [[1111, 1118], "Q31"], [[1226, 1233], "Unknown"], [[1328, 1335], "Q32484"], [[1338, 1345], "Q32484"], [[1493, 1502], "Q81046"], [[1579, 1586], "Q32484"], [[1667, 1680], "Unknown"], [[1685, 1698], "Unknown"], [[1740, 1747], "Q32484"], [[1841, 1851], "Unknown"], [[1856, 1871], "Unknown"], [[1989, 1997], "Q214"], [[2005, 2019], "Q213"], [[2026, 2033], "Q32484"], [[2059, 2066], "Q31"], [[2087, 2097], "Q1780"], [[2113, 2119], "Q1085"], [[2169, 2176], "Q32484"], [[2192, 2207], "Unknown"], [[2361, 2366], "Q55"], [[2405, 2413], "Unknown"], [[2454, 2456], "Unknown"], [[2461, 2466], "Unknown"], [[2577, 2584], "Q31"], [[2620, 2627], "Q32484"], [[2861, 2868], "Unknown"], [[2879, 2886], "Q32484"], [[2908, 2913], "Unknown"], [[2918, 2925], "Unknown"], [[2930, 2932], "Unknown"], [[2937, 2942], "Unknown"], [[3005, 3012], "Q32484"], [[3267, 3274], "Q32484"], [[3309, 3314], "Unknown"], [[3319, 3326], "Unknown"], [[3431, 3438], "Unknown"], [[3448, 3465], "Q12498"], [[3670, 3677], "Q32484"]]}

The fledgling company , established in a ground-floor office here over the last two weeks , has received venture financing from Bessemer Venture Partners of Menlo Park , Calif .. David Cowan , Internet Startup founder and acting chief executive , is a general partner of Bessemer . The startup company 's acting chairman is Jim Bidzos , the president of RSA Data Security , a unit of Security Dynamics Technologies Inc. as well as chairman of VeriSign .

Java is a computer programming language introduced by Sun Microsystems in mid-1995 which has immediately captured the attention of the industry for its ability to operate across virtually all computer system in a relatively secure manner . Just last week , Sun Microsystems and the Silicon Valley venture capital giant Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers said they had completed financing of a $ 100 million fund managed by Kleiner Perkins to fund startups developing Java technologies . Java has been licensed by nearly 50 organisations , ranging from Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. to the Taiwan government . Prasad Wagle , another former senior JavaSoft engineer who is among the founding engineers at Internet Startup , said the new company aims to build software infrastructure using Java to make networked applications ubiquitious . One feature of the Java language is that small software programmes , known as \" applets \" because they are small applications , can be downloaded from the server computers at the centre of networks onto individual computers for use . In this model , individual computer users can always gain access to the latest programmes and do not need to store more software than they are currently using on their computers at any one time , also saving costs of memory and storage .

SUGO , Japan 1996-08-25 Teenager Yuuichi Takeda , racing in only his first season , outclassed the big names to win the first race in round nine of the world superbike championship on Sunday . Takeda , 18 , showed poise far beyond his years to overtake Australian Ducati rider Troy Corser , last year 's championship runner-up , with four of the 25 laps left . Honda 's Takeda was pursued past Corser by the Yamaha duo of Noriyuki Haga and Wataru Yoshikawa with Haga briefly taking the lead in the final chicane on the last lap . But Takeda found one more spurt of power to just take the flag first with Haga second and Yoshikawa third . Haga had the consolation of recording the fastest lap at 147.159 kph . Corser , who crashed during practice on Friday , limped in fourth , four seconds behind Takeda with championship leader Aaron Slight of New Zealand 11 seconds behind the winner . In the second race , Takeda again challenged strongly until the fifth lap from the end when he crashed while running second to eventual race winner Takuma Aoki . Aoki , the elder brother of reigning 125cc world champion Haruchika , had a race-long duel with John Kocinski of the United States on a Ducati before taking the chequered flag . Kocinski led for the early laps before he was passed first by Aoki , who recorded the fastest lap of 147.786 kph , and then by Takeda . With Takeda out of the race , Kocinski regained second place but he could not overtake Aoki . Haga again was the unlucky rider finishing third ahead of Slight with Corser in 10th place . But the strong showing by the Japanese riders did not alter the championship table with Slight still leading on 280 points , followed by Corser with 269 and Kocinski with 254 .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 1789], "labels": [[[15, 23], "Q17"], [[39, 43], "Unknown"], [[62, 66], "Unknown"], [[69, 74], "Q17"], [[95, 109], "Unknown"], [[255, 261], "Unknown"], [[315, 325], "Q408"], [[326, 332], "Q2539909"], [[339, 350], "Q577264"], [[423, 428], "Q1093559"], [[432, 438], "Unknown"], [[456, 462], "Q577264"], [[470, 476], "Q158888"], [[484, 497], "Q641883"], [[502, 518], "Q4018505"], [[524, 528], "Q641883"], [[596, 602], "Unknown"], [[666, 670], "Q641883"], [[682, 691], "Q4018505"], [[700, 704], "Q641883"], [[771, 777], "Q577264"], [[859, 865], "Unknown"], [[891, 903], "Q302710"], [[907, 918], "Q664"], [[971, 977], "Unknown"], [[1098, 1109], "Q1363531"], [[1112, 1116], "Q1363531"], [[1170, 1179], "Q998899"], [[1208, 1221], "Q732601"], [[1229, 1242], "Q30"], [[1248, 1254], "Q271812"], [[1290, 1298], "Q732601"], [[1352, 1356], "Q1363531"], [[1417, 1423], "Unknown"], [[1431, 1437], "Unknown"], [[1456, 1464], "Q732601"], [[1513, 1517], "Q1363531"], [[1520, 1524], "Q641883"], [[1578, 1584], "Q302710"], [[1590, 1596], "Q577264"], [[1643, 1651], "Q17"], [[1701, 1707], "Q302710"], [[1750, 1756], "Q577264"], [[1770, 1778], "Q732601"]]}

A super piece of fielding by Lewis , dropped as a disciplinary measure after arriving only 35 minutes before the start on the fourth morning , provided the only bright spot for England as the touring team batted on to reach 413 for five at the interval , a lead of 87 . The solitary wicket to fall was Asif Mujtaba , run out for 13 attempting a second run to third man where Lewis was lurking with a point to prove . There seemed scant danger until the Surrey player swooped on to the ball and returned off balance to county team mate Alec Stewart who whipped off the bails . Lewis , though , could not make similar waves with the ball as Salim Malik and Wasim Akram batted through the rest of the session with few alarms . Wasim rattled along to 30 not out , outscoring his partner who was unbeaten on 24 at the break , although the weather was again threatening to play the dominant role .

LISBON 1996-08-25 Portuguese champions Porto kicked off the season with a disappointing 2-2 home draw against Setubal and were lucky to squeeze in an equaliser in extra time . Porto , who are fighting to take their third consecutive title this season , were 2-0 down until the 86th minute when a header by Mario Jardel found the net after a string of missed opportunities , including a penalty taken by top league scorer Domingos Oliveira in the 60th minute . Domingos redeemed himself by netting the equaliser just into extra time . Setubal , who put on a skilful counter-attack throughout the game , opened the scoring 16 minutes into the match when an unmarked Chiquinho Conde shot around Porto 's new Polish keeper Andrejez Wozniak . Conde scored his second in the 70th minute . Benfica , also playing their first game of the season at home , were held to a 1-1 draw by northern side Braga despite the fact that the visitors were reduced to 10 men in the 54th minute after Rodrigo Carneiro was sent off for a second bookable offence . Benfica dominated the game but their lack of a first-class striker was apparent throughout and in the 30th minute they lost key Brazilian midfielder Valdo who suffered a light knee injury . He was substituted by Paulao . Benfica finally opened the scoring in the 81st minute with a penalty taken by Helder after Luis Baltasar tripped up captain Joao Pinto under the referee 's nose .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "SOCCER - FIORENTINA WIN WITH BATISTUTA DOUBLE . MILAN 1996-08-25 Argentine striker Gabriel Batistuta gave Fiorentina the perfect 70th birthday present on Sunday with two goals that gave the Italian Cup winners a 2-1 Supercup victory over serie A champions Milan . The victory , coming on the eve of the founding of the Florence club in 1926 , also marked the first time since the pre-season trophy between the Cup winners and league champions was started in 1988 that the Cup winners had won . Batistuta gave Fiorentina the lead in the 11th minute . Sweden 's Stefan Schwarz picked him out with a lob to the edge of the box and Batistuta did the rest , chipping veteran defender Franco Baresi and scoring at the near post . Montenegrin midfielder Dejan Savicevic equalised for the home team , weaving past a defender , checking and firing in a left-footed shot in the 21st minute that gave young Fiorentina goalkeeper Francesco Toldo little chance . The scored stayed level to the final minutes but with a penalty shoot out looming , Batistuta took charge . French international midfielder Marcel Desailly fouled the Argentine , whose coach at Boca Juniors before he joined Fiorentina in 1991 was new Milan coach Oscar Tabarez , and Batistuta rammed home the free kick from 30 metres out . The 83rd minute shot , curling over the defence and dipping in under the bar from the striker dubbed Batigol by adoring Fiorentina fans , was just reward for Fiorentina who looked a far more impressive team .

PRETORIA , Aug 25 - Captain Sean Fitzpatrick and his All Blacks revisited the test venue today to relive some of the magic moments of yesterday 's momentous rugby victory over South Africa , NZPA reported . Most of the test 15 who beat the Springboks 33-26 to secure New Zealand 's first-ever rugby series in South Africa stood in the middle of the empty 50,000-seat Loftus Versfeld . Magnificent , ' ' said Fitzpatrick , New Zealand 's most capped player and the world 's most capped forward . The players relived the moves and tries , the tackles and what might have been as the emotions of victory continued . Zinzan Brooke , the only No 8 in test rugby to have scored a dropped goal when he kicked a three-pointer against England during last year 's World Cup , added a second to his name yesterday . I was right here , ' ' he said standing at the spot where he had received the ball for the kick . The maul was there and I was going to go in but I thought I should hold off because we had the ball . When ( halfback ) Justin Marshall got the ball he was going to go on the openside where Jon Preston was so I emptied my lung at him to get the ball this way . I just hit through and I was punching the air before the ball got there . It cost me a few bucks at the bar . ' ' The decision to attempt a dropped goal was a spontaneous one , Brooke said . It was just like the World Cup , the ball came and the chance was there . ' ' Centre Frank Bunce said he had never felt so exhausted during a match . We were gutted and there was nowhere to hide , they just kept coming at you , ' ' he said . I was gone in the first 20 minutes , completely exhausted , but you had no choice . There was just so much riding on it . It 's amazing just how big this ground was yesterday . ' ' Two-try winger Jeff Wilson said he was so tired that he kept asking Bunce where he should be while defending . He told me I 'm buggered too so just hang in there ' , ' ' Wilson recalled . About 4000 New Zealander supporters were partying into the early hours of today in the South African capital . Messages of goodwill continued to roll into the team hotel . All Blacks coach John Hart said Prime Minister Jim Bolger rang him today to offer his congratulations . He thanked us on behalf of the country , which is really nice for the team , and I understand we had tremendous support at home .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "South Africa yet to hear from apartheid enforcers . Anton Ferreira CAPE TOWN 1996-08-25 South Africa 's truth commission begins issuing subpoenas this week in a bid to dig beneath the political rationales and find the sinister figures who have the blood of the country 's race war on their hands . Leaders of the major parties involved , from right-wing whites to radical blacks , appeared before Archbishop Desmond Tutu 's Truth and Reconciliation Commission last week to paint the broad picture of their actions for or against apartheid . Most , including former president F.W. de Klerk and African National Congress Deputy President Thabo Mbeki , offered apologies for any mistakes they had made and accepted broad responsibility for the actions of their foot soldiers . But none named those guilty of ordering or carrying out any of the gross violations of human rights which Tutu is investigating . Human rights lawyer Brian Currin said the hearings last week were not intended as a form of confessional and that those who personally committed crimes during apartheid would testify only before a separate arm of the commission , the amnesty committee . \" I do n't think one should have expected more than what one got , \" he said . \" That was not the amnesty committee where perpetrators are expected to open their hearts and souls and to tell it all . \" The commission , which has the power to grant amnesty to those who confess to abuses , has begun hearing the testimony from people already in jail for their deeds . But others , such as self-confessed secret police hit-squad leader Dirk Coetzee , have yet to testify . Tutu 's deputy chairman , Alex Boraine , told reporters the commission would begin issuing subpoenas to suspects who refused to appear voluntarily some time this week . He added that former hardline apartheid president P.W. Botha could be among those called . But Currin , who is advising several people regarded as perpetrators , said this was not the best way to achieve the commission 's aims . \" A person can be forced to appear , but the only way one is going to get to the truth in its totality is if people feel it is a good idea to go to the amnesty committee . At the moment this is not the case . \" He cited Coetzee , who was charged with murder after confessing in media interviews to dirty tricks . His trial is due to start in December but the truth commission intends to decide on his amnesty application before that . Currin said the law had to be changed so all judicial prosecutions were automatically suspended for those who approached the truth commission . Last week 's submissions to the commission by the ANC , de Klerk 's National Party and the right-wing Freedom Front of General Constand Viljoen left many South Africans unsatisfied . Boraine said the picture was incomplete because officers of the apartheid-era security forces had yet to make their scheduled , separate submission , but one black caller to a radio talk show declared : \" This whole thing is utterly useless , it does n't help us at all . What the people expect is to have houses , to have jobs . \" Political scientist Jannie Gagiano said he doubted that the National Party , which implemented apartheid in 1948 and began dismantling it in 1990 , felt it carried a burden of guilt and needed to be exculpated through the commission . \" Therefore I have some doubts about achieving some form of reconciliation . One has to feel a bit guilty to feel the need for reconciling yourself to a historical adversary , \" he said . Professor Tom Lodge of the University of the Witwatersrand demurred , saying : \" In the irritation , in the jokes , in the anger that white South Africans express about the commission , I think there 's a moral uneasiness , and I think that 's healthy . Responsibility is percolating downwards . \"", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 3841], "labels": [[[0, 12], "Q258"], [[52, 66], "Unknown"], [[67, 76], "Q5465"], [[88, 100], "Q258"], [[408, 420], "Q43033"], [[424, 459], "Unknown"], [[575, 588], "Q151813"], [[593, 618], "Q83162"], [[636, 647], "Q101547"], [[880, 884], "Q43033"], [[924, 936], "Q3755412"], [[1592, 1604], "Q1227804"], [[1629, 1633], "Q43033"], [[1655, 1667], "Unknown"], [[1848, 1858], "Q212286"], [[1893, 1899], "Q3755412"], [[2247, 2254], "Q1227804"], [[2462, 2468], "Q3755412"], [[2656, 2659], "Q83162"], [[2662, 2670], "Unknown"], [[2674, 2688], "Q740718"], [[2708, 2721], "Q510163"], [[2733, 2749], "Q2568741"], [[2760, 2774], "Unknown"], [[2789, 2796], "Unknown"], [[3141, 3155], "Unknown"], [[3181, 3195], "Q740718"], [[3554, 3563], "Unknown"], [[3571, 3602], "Q534643"], [[3684, 3698], "Unknown"]]}
{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "Moslem refugees seek to vote in Serb-held town . Samir Arnaut MATUZICI , Bosnia 1996-08-25 Thousands of Moslem refugees denounced Bosnia 's elections as a farce on Sunday because Serb incomers would be able to vote in their old home town , cementing partition of the country . They said they were ready to force their way back across post-war ethnic lines to Serb-held Doboj , one of several towns where NATO troops fear violence involving refugees determined to vote where they once lived . The refugees , rallying in Matuzici on government territory two km from Doboj in northeast Bosnia , waved banners calling the polls a farce staged by the United Nations and the European Union . \" We demand to vote in Doboj , \" other banners said . Bosnia 's Moslem-led central government and many displaced Moslems are angered by a key provision of the Western-organised September 14 elections allowing people to vote in post-war \" new places of residence . \" As a result , separatist Serb authorities have packed former Moslem majority towns with refugees of their own or registered other Serbs to vote there . Critics say that what was billed as an electoral process to reintegrate Bosnia as a single , multi-ethnic state is shaping up as a referendum on partition , de facto or de jure . \" Only our physical presence in Doboj will mean that the Dayton peace treaty has truly been implemented , \" Edhem Efendija Camdzic , Doboj 's Islamic imam-in-exile , told the refugees . \" The main point of this rally is to highlight to the world powers what misfortune they brought upon us , \" said Reuf Mehemdagic , head of Doboj municipality-in-exile . \" Eleven thousand Serbs who came from elsewhere to Doboj will vote there . How can we then expect the reintegration of Bosnia ? But no one will stop us from returning to our homes . \" Mirhunisa Komarica , a government refugee official , said : \" We want to vote where we were thrown out from . This is a protest of warning and the next step is entering our town using all means possible , so let them shoot . \" Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic , a Moslem , told the refugees : \" We have a message for the Serbs who are now in our homes not to plan the future of their children there because there will be no good fortune in that . \" To loud applause , he added : \" We will enter Doboj , untie the Doboj knot and ensure free movement for all . We have to enter Doboj to free the Serbs from their own ( separatist ) politics . \" The Dayton peace accords guaranteed refugees the right to return to their homes and ensured freedom of movement across ethnic lines . But local police , controlled by nationalist parties in Moslem , Serb and Croat sectors of Bosnia , and civilian mobs have turned ceasefire lines into virtually impassable borders . The majority of refugees from Bosnia 's 1992-95 war are Moslems from the Serb-controlled north and east . NATO-led peace troops beefed up their presence in the Doboj area on Sunday to deter any sudden emotional attempt by the refugees to cross the Inter-Entity Boundary Line into Doboj . But the crowd dispersed without incident . Moslems and Serbs have scuffled several times along the line in the past when Moslem refugees tried to surge into the town .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 3237], "labels": [[[0, 6], "Q432"], [[32, 41], "Unknown"], [[49, 61], "Unknown"], [[62, 70], "Unknown"], [[73, 79], "Q225"], [[104, 110], "Q432"], [[130, 136], "Q225"], [[179, 183], "Q403"], [[359, 368], "Unknown"], [[369, 374], "Q169247"], [[404, 408], "Q1091051"], [[519, 527], "Unknown"], [[564, 569], "Q169247"], [[583, 589], "Q225"], [[646, 660], "Q1065"], [[669, 683], "Q458"], [[709, 714], "Q169247"], [[740, 746], "Q225"], [[750, 760], "Unknown"], [[799, 806], "Q432"], [[845, 862], "Unknown"], [[977, 981], "Q403"], [[1013, 1019], "Q432"], [[1082, 1087], "Q127885"], [[1176, 1182], "Q225"], [[1315, 1320], "Q169247"], [[1340, 1346], "Q190315"], [[1391, 1413], "Unknown"], [[1416, 1421], "Q169247"], [[1425, 1432], "Q432"], [[1582, 1597], "Unknown"], [[1608, 1613], "Q169247"], [[1656, 1661], "Q127885"], [[1689, 1694], "Q169247"], [[1757, 1763], "Q225"], [[1822, 1840], "Unknown"], [[2049, 2056], "Q225"], [[2072, 2082], "Q1276440"], [[2087, 2093], "Q432"], [[2144, 2149], "Q127885"], [[2318, 2323], "Q169247"], [[2336, 2341], "Q169247"], [[2399, 2404], "Q169247"], [[2417, 2422], "Q127885"], [[2470, 2476], "Q190315"], [[2656, 2662], "Q432"], [[2665, 2669], "Q403"], [[2674, 2679], "Q153128"], [[2691, 2697], "Q225"], [[2812, 2818], "Q225"], [[2838, 2845], "Q432"], [[2855, 2870], "Unknown"], [[2888, 2896], "Unknown"], [[2942, 2947], "Q169247"], [[3030, 3056], "Unknown"], [[3062, 3067], "Q169247"], [[3113, 3120], "Q432"], [[3125, 3130], "Q127885"], [[3191, 3197], "Q432"]]}

Anne Murray NEW YORK 1996-08-23 Corporate America is planning major changes in employee compensation in the next few years , according to a recent study . What it comes down to is this : If you 're highly skilled , you 'll benefit nicely . But if you 're not and cannot contribute to your employer 's goals , you 'll be paid less . The survey , conducted in late 1995 and the early part of this year by management consulting firm Towers Perrin , showed that the focus will be on an employee 's overall value to the company 's bottom line -- rather than how well an employee performs a specific task . Presently , for example , if an accountant 's job involves doing five specific tasks , he or she can expect a certain salary , said Sandra O'Neal , a Towers Perrin principal . In the future , the accountant will be evaluated solely on \" knowledge , skill and abilities , \" she said . In addition to using accounting skills , the accountant will also have to be creative , work well in a team , be sensitive to customer needs and set productivity goals . \" The good news is , if you 're highly skilled and have many abilities , you 'll be paid more , \" said O'Neal . \" The bad news is , if you 're not skilled and ca n't contribute to a team , to customer service and the organisation 's goals , you 'll be paid less . \" Of the 750 mid-to-large size corporations surveyed , 81 percent had undergone a major restructuring in the last three years , and more than two-thirds reported that productivity and profits were up as result . Next on the agenda for these firms is developing a new compensation structure , and 78 percent report that they are considering a new , skills-based plan for both management and non-management employees . This coming shift , O'Neal said , \" is not just isolated or a fad . It 's an inexorable change . \" After World War II , corporations adopted a \" military model \" creating hierarchical organisations where \" the concept of defined tasks worked great , \" she said . But as the economy became global , customers were more demanding and problems became more complex . \" Multi-layers kept management at a distance from its customers , \" O'Neal said . Now organisations must change to stay competitive . O'Neal says firms will place a greater emphasis on teams and team performance in giving raises . If your team does well , you 'll do well . If it does n't do well , do n't expect a raise . Is this fair to an employee who can go the distance but is on a team that ca n't keep up ? \" That 's an important question we used to ask a lot , \" said O'Neal . \" It 's not a question we ask any more . The more important question is -- ' Do we have results ? ' \" To get those results , 27 percent of the companies surveyed plan to eliminate base pay increases in favour of cash bonuses and incentives , such as employee and team award programmes and education . Companies that can change their culture and view employees as business partners will do well , O'Neal said . For example , the survey rated some participants in the survey as \" high-performing \" companies , based on their return on equity above 16 percent . Those companies also said they already offer employees variable pay and business education , give their managers more control over pay decisions and celebrate employee and team success . \" They respect employees more , they trust employees more and they value their employees more , \" O'Neal said . \" The key to success at high-performance companies is engaging employees in a business partnership . It will improve a company 's bottom line . \"", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 3639], "labels": [[[10, 17], "Q30"], [[52, 63], "Unknown"], [[64, 72], "Q60"], [[94, 101], "Q30"], [[482, 495], "Q3535944"], [[785, 798], "Unknown"], [[803, 816], "Q3535944"], [[1210, 1216], "Unknown"], [[1808, 1814], "Unknown"], [[1893, 1905], "Q362"], [[2219, 2225], "Unknown"], [[2285, 2291], "Unknown"], [[2627, 2633], "Unknown"], [[3032, 3038], "Unknown"], [[3480, 3486], "Unknown"]]}

Police used batons and teargas to try to disperse students who were throwing stones and home-made bombs , witnesses said . The strike , called by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party ( BNP ) , to denounce the deaths of four students killed by police over the last few days , coincided with a visit to the area by Hasina .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "FEATURE - Fertile Ukraine faces drought of cash and rain . Irene Marushko BATKIVSHCHYNA COLLECTIVE FARM , Ukraine 1996-08-26 Four shiny new green-and-yellow John Deere combines parked at this 1,750-hectare ( 4,325-acre ) farm in the grain-growing regions south of Kiev do n't fill its chief agronomist with enthusiasm . \" They did a good job this year , but they need good diesel and good engine oil , \" said Ivan Odnosum . \" God help us if there is a breakdown , \" he said of the machinery , loaned to the farm after the Ukrainian government bought it earlier this year . The country 's grain harvest this year is forecast to fall by more than 23 percent to only 28 million tonnes and two harsh factors are to blame . A drought scoured the steppes in May and June , stunting the growing wheat . And the farming sector , making the painful transition from Soviet central planning to a market economy simply has no money . Ukraine 's black soil is so fertile that a diplomat described it as \" rich enough to grow rubber boots \" . But recently Ukraine has been losing its reputation as a breadbasket of Europe , earned in the years before brutal forced collectivisation under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin . \" The wheat will not be of a good quality this year , \" said Hryhory Borsuk , a scientist at the Mironivka Wheat Institute , run by the Ukrainian Academy of Agrarian Sciences . \" The temperature on the ground reached 62 decrees Celsius ( 143.60 Fahrenheit ) this summer . We 've never seen anything so bad , \" he said in an interview in his office , unlit since the government cut off electricity because of unpaid power bills . The harvest is gathered in the dry areas , but rainfall in Western Ukraine has delayed harvesting there . While Mironivka 's scientists , some unpaid for months , carry on developing new strains of wheat resistant to Ukraine 's extreme continental climate , Borsuk said the lack of cash in Ukraine 's agricultural sector is as bad as the drought . Collective farms and Ukraine 's nascent private farming sector have no money for fertiliser , no money for herbicides and pesticides , no money to repair old or buy new machinery , no money for fuel , and none to buy good seed . This year 's harvest is down from last year 's 36.5 million tonne harvest , which in turn compares with 50 million tonnes in 1990 , the year before independence . The decline is all the worse for people who recall wasteful Soviet times , when the Kremlin imported grain but priced bread so cheaply that people bought it to feed their pigs . \" Agriculture is very expensive , and there are no solutions to our problems on the horizon , \" said Odnosum . He said his farm , its 260 workers now readying the fields for winter wheat sowing , expected the land to yield 5.2 tonnes per hectare ( 2.5 acres ) but ended up with 3.9 tonnes -- still better than the national average of 2.11 tonnes per hectare this year . \" We did not have money for fertiliser , we 're in debt for fuel , and we 're borrowing diesel , \" Odnosum said . A few kilometres ( miles ) down the two-lane road which passes Odnosum 's farm , where the occasional horse-drawn buggy passes by , is the 1,700-hectare ( 4,200-acre ) Shevchenko collective farm , built next to a village still neat and tidy despite post-Soviet decay . Chief Accountant Natalya Sypron said the collective is strapped for cash , earlier this year bartering 220 tonnes of grain for diesel to fuel six rickety grain combines and tractors badly in need of repairs and basic maintenance . The average family earns 160-200 million karbovanets a year ( $ 800 - $ 1,000 ) -- but many have not been paid in months , Soprun said . \" People are working out of their own dedication . \" Borsuk said the farm sector has two options : \" We can sit down and cry , or we can do something . \" He said the government plans to increase the sowing of the winter wheat which will be harvested next year . Planted in late summer and early autumn , the grain is Ukraine 's largest export item and traditionally grows better than summer wheat in Ukraine 's soil . Further plans , he said , called for full provision of resources like fertiliser and herbicides for 25 percent of Ukraine 's arable land next year , for 50 percent in 1998 and 100 percent of the land in 1999 . \" If we follow this we 'll be able to sell 10 million tonnes of grain by the year 2000 , \" Borkus said . The government has been trying to phase out huge subsidies to the farm sector , and in a move back to pre-Soviet days has given up to 50 hectares ( 124 acres ) of land to some 36,000 private farmers willing to go it alone . Collective farms will last for the next few years , because most private farms now only produce enough to feed themselves with maybe a little extra to sell , said one private farmer : \" In the future , maybe , but it 's better not to hurry . \" Collectivisation brought us a lot of pain . And it went too fast . Privatising too quickly can also have a negative outcome . \"", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 5001], "labels": [[[18, 25], "Q212"], [[59, 73], "Unknown"], [[74, 103], "Unknown"], [[106, 113], "Q212"], [[157, 167], "Q496302"], [[264, 268], "Q1899"], [[409, 421], "Unknown"], [[426, 429], "Q190"], [[522, 531], "Q212"], [[856, 862], "Q15180"], [[922, 929], "Q212"], [[1042, 1049], "Q212"], [[1101, 1107], "Q46"], [[1174, 1180], "Q15180"], [[1190, 1202], "Q855"], [[1266, 1280], "Unknown"], [[1302, 1327], "Unknown"], [[1341, 1379], "Unknown"], [[1433, 1440], "Q25267"], [[1693, 1708], "Unknown"], [[1746, 1755], "Unknown"], [[1851, 1858], "Q212"], [[1892, 1898], "Unknown"], [[1924, 1931], "Q212"], [[2003, 2010], "Q212"], [[2434, 2440], "Q15180"], [[2458, 2465], "Q133274"], [[2653, 2660], "Unknown"], [[3021, 3028], "Unknown"], [[3099, 3106], "Unknown"], [[3204, 3214], "Unknown"], [[3285, 3296], "Q302045"], [[3322, 3336], "Unknown"], [[3659, 3665], "Unknown"], [[3726, 3732], "Unknown"], [[3990, 3997], "Q212"], [[4073, 4080], "Q212"], [[4205, 4212], "Q212"], [[4392, 4398], "Unknown"], [[4508, 4518], "Unknown"]]}

Melanie Cheary JOHANNESBURG 1996-08-26 Gencor Ltd on Monday said it had swelled its year attributable profit and streamlined operations to strengthen it for the current financial year despite a variety of divisional setbacks . Announcing the group 's results for the year ended June 30 , chairman Brian Gilbertson said : \" Happily the strong improvement in financial performance is not an illusion arising from the recent weakness of the rand relative to the dollar . \" Gencor raised attributable earnings to 1,803 million rand from 1,003 million rand previously - in dollar terms an increase to $ 469 million from $ 279 million - and won despite the group 's Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd posting dismal results . \" Not everything has gone well . We 've had substantial production difficulties at a number of our operations . The most obvious one with the greatest effect on the corporation was at Impala where we had the furnace failure , \" Gilbertson said . Implats posted year attributable profit of 176 million rand from 281 million previously . Not only did the company lock in 3.92 rand per dollar in February / March , but it suffered output losses due to a furnace shutdown last August . The rand was last bid at 4.5350 against the dollar . Nor was Implats the only operation to fail output targets . Ingwe Coal Corporation Ltd was hit hard by heavy rains . It forfeited nearly one million tonnes of production to flooding at its mines in Mpumulanga province . But Gilbertson said the greatest gloom in the year came from the European Commission 's blocking of Implats ' proposed merger with Lonrho Plc 's platinum interests . \" The big disappointment for the year was the failure of the platinum merger . From Gencor 's perspective we are taking the position that it is not on , \" Gilbertson said . Looking ahead to the current financial year , he said that Gencor would boost earnings further . \" Gencor is well placed to take up the challenges of the future . The group is soundly structured and prudently financed and is blessed with an excellent portfolio of world-class businesses . I think we can look forward to further growth \" . Citing the disposal of Gencor 's stake in industrial holdings group Malbak Ltd for one billion rand among other smaller disposals , Gilbertson said Gencor had pruned its portfolio to concentrate on core assets . \" We 've tried to clean up our overall portfolio by disposing of non-core assets . The biggest of those was Malbak . Overall a very substantial pruning ... leaving Gencor clearly structured along commodity lines , \" Gilbertson said . He added that the group still had about 85 million rand after tax invested in various shares , which were market for disposal when required . Referring to Gencor 's increased 41.5 percent stake in Ingwe , Gilbertson said the group would wait for coal shares to be cheaper before considering snapping up more . \" I think we would have liked to have more of Ingwe but it 's the question of adding value .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "SOCCER - SEYCHELLES FAIL IN BID FOR HISTORIC VICTORY . Mark Gleeson JOHANNESBURG 1996-08-26 The tiny islands of the Seychelles failed to make soccer history at the weekend when they bowed out of the preliminary rounds of the African Nations Cup . Trailing fellow Indian Ocean islanders Mauritius 1-0 from the first leg , they were held to a 1-1 draw at home on Saturday despite playing against 10 men for most of the match . The 2-1 aggregate took Mauritius into the group phase of the qualifiers for the 1998 finals , and kept up the Seychelles ' record of never having won an official match in their 10 years of FIFA membership . The Seychelles must have thought they were on course for a historic breakthrough when Mauritian midfielder Andre Caboche was sent off for a crude tackle in the 19th minute . But the visitors responded to the setback immediately -- veteran striker Ashley Mocude scoring a minute later to give them a two-goal aggregate lead . Although Danny Rose 's 50th-minute equaliser gave the Seychellois renewed hope they could not find the net again and were eliminated . Mauritius now play in group seven of the qualifiers against Malawi , Mozambique and favourites Zambia . Namibia , who drew 0-0 with Botswana in their first leg , won the second leg in Windhoek 6-0 to stretch their unbeaten run to eight matches and continue their remarkable progress on the African soccer stage . They now play in group five with Cameroon , Gabon and Kenya . German-based striker Bachirou Salou returned home to Togo to score the decisive only goal of their tie against Congo . Salou , who plays for MSV Duisburg in the Bundesliga , scored in the 53rd minute of Sunday 's match in Lome for a 1-0 aggregate win which takes his side into group six , where they will meet Liberia , Tanzania and Zaire . Ethiopia needed a penalty shoot-out in Addis Ababa to overcome Uganda after a 2-2 aggregate scoreline . Both legs ended 1-1 before Ethiopia won the spot kick decider 4-2 . Uganda 's elimination follows their humiliating 5-1 aggregate defeat by Angola in June 's World Cup qualifying preliminaries . The other preliminary round second leg match , between Mauritania and Benin in Nouakchott , was postponed until Friday .

Popov , who won gold in the 50 and 100 metres freestyle at the recent Atlanta Olympics , was stabbed in the abdomen late on Saturday after an argument with a group of roadside watermelon sellers in south-west Moscow . Maslova said the wound had affected a lung and a kidney . Doctors operated on Popov , 24 , for three hours . Popov told NTV television on Sunday he was in no danger and promised he would be back in the pool shortly . \" There 's no need to worry . We 're going to be walking soon -- and swimming , \" he insisted cheerfully from his bed in the intensive care unit . Interfax news agency said police had detained one of the attackers .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "SOCCER - PLAYERS LEAVE MATCH EARLY TO CATCH PLANE . Brian Homewood RIO DE JANEIRO 1996-08-26 Two key players left a Brazilian championship match early on Sunday because they had to catch a plane to Russia to play with the national team . Sao Paulo midfielder Andre and Santos defender Narciso were both substituted during their teams ' game , taken to Sao Paulo airport and flown to Rio de Janeiro in a private jet chartered by the Brazilian Football Confederation ( CBF ) . At Rio , they joined up with the national team squad for the journey to Moscow , where Brazil will face Russia in a friendly international on Wednesday . The problem arose because the Sao Paulo-Santos clash was selected as the day 's televised live match , forcing it to be put back three hours from the usual kickoff time . Santos suffered more from their loss as Narciso 's replacement Jean gave away a penalty from which Sao Paulo scored the decisive goal in a 2-1 win . Sao Paulo lead the first stage of the championship on goal difference from surprise package Juventude , who beat Internacional 2-1 . Corinthians , who played in a tournament in Spain last week , also faced a plane marathon as they attempted to keep up with a hectic fixture list . They were due to leave Spain Monday night , arrive in Sao Paulo on Tuesday morning , catch another plane to the southern city of Curitiba one hour later and then play away to Atletico Paranaense in the Brazilian championship the same evening . Botafogo striker Tulio , who was overlooked by Zagalo for the tour which also features a game away to the Netherlands on Sunday , scored his third goal in three games as the defending champions beat Bahia 2-1 away . Tulio , who has been top-scorer in the competition for the last two seasons , has been struggling against injury for most of this year .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 1826], "labels": [[[52, 66], "Unknown"], [[67, 81], "Q8678"], [[116, 125], "Q155"], [[198, 204], "Q159"], [[238, 247], "Q38568"], [[259, 264], "Unknown"], [[269, 275], "Q80955"], [[285, 292], "Q2314547"], [[352, 361], "Q174"], [[383, 397], "Q8678"], [[432, 464], "Q244754"], [[467, 470], "Q244754"], [[478, 481], "Q8678"], [[547, 553], "Q649"], [[562, 568], "Q83459"], [[579, 585], "Q726080"], [[659, 675], "Unknown"], [[800, 806], "Q80955"], [[840, 847], "Q2314547"], [[863, 867], "Q210114"], [[899, 908], "Q38568"], [[949, 958], "Q38568"], [[1041, 1050], "Q910453"], [[1062, 1075], "Q80845"], [[1082, 1093], "Q35933"], [[1126, 1131], "Q29"], [[1253, 1258], "Q29"], [[1284, 1293], "Q174"], [[1359, 1367], "Q4361"], [[1405, 1424], "Q506832"], [[1432, 1441], "Q155"], [[1474, 1482], "Q80958"], [[1491, 1496], "Q714354"], [[1521, 1527], "Unknown"], [[1580, 1591], "Q47050"], [[1673, 1678], "Q198032"], [[1690, 1695], "Q714354"]]}

Bill Berkrot NEW YORK 1996-08-26 A message on television monitors all around the National Tennis Centre reads : \" Due to hot weather please seek shade and drink plenty of fluids \" -- sound advice until you check out the price of fluids . Perhaps the advisory was cut off before concluding : \" ...and bring plenty of money . \" A small bottle of a garishly-coloured sports drink at the sun-drenched U.S. Open is going for $ 3.75 , while a litre of basic , life-sustaining water will set you back $ 4.00 -- for water ? \" At the Olympics water was only a dollar , and that was the Olympics , \" said one incredulous fan , noting that the Atlanta Games had been notorious for price gouging . U.S. Open officials managed to insult most of the male tennis players last week with their controversial handling of the seeding and draw . When the tournament began on Monday it was the fans ' turn to be offended . \" That baked lasagna better be good for $ 8.50 , \" said New Yorker Rebecca Weinstein , a U.S. Open regular who was eating a sandwich she had brought from home . A trio of hungry fans at the food court who had already forked over the lasagna money pronounced it good , but Carol Perry chimed in , \" The water is ridiculous , they want four dollars for the water , you might as well get a glass of wine . \" Indeed , a nice glass of chardonnay or white zinfandel was going for $ 4.75 , while an imported beer was just a bit more than the water at $ 4.50 . What 's the message here ? \" Maybe they want us to be alcoholics , \" Perry joked before lifting her glass of wine . Fans will be shelling out $ 12.50 for a hamburger and a large french fries . And that little snack is guaranteed to make you thirsty . Make that $ 16.50 . Even a sandwich as pedestrian as a ham and swiss cheese is going for a whopping $ 8.00 . Of course , it is served on a tuscan roll . It must be the cost of flying those rolls over from Tuscany every day that drives up the price of the sandwich .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 2037], "labels": [[[54, 63], "Q123577"], [[66, 78], "Unknown"], [[79, 87], "Q60"], [[147, 169], "Unknown"], [[463, 472], "Q123577"], [[591, 599], "Q8531"], [[643, 651], "Q159821"], [[699, 712], "Q8531"], [[752, 761], "Q123577"], [[1024, 1034], "Q60"], [[1035, 1052], "Unknown"], [[1057, 1066], "Q123577"], [[1240, 1251], "Unknown"], [[1590, 1595], "Unknown"], [[1977, 1984], "Q1273"]]}
{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "TENNIS - HUBER AND MALEEVA FALL , UP-AND-COMERS ADVANCE AT OPEN . Larry Fine NEW YORK 1996-08-26 Martina Hingis led a youthful charge and Australian Open finalist Anke Huber and Magdalena Maleeva were fallen seeds on Monday in a hot , sunny opening to the U.S. Open tennis championships . The 15-year-old Hingis , seeded 16th , was honoured to play the first match of the season 's last Grand Slam on Stadium Court but happy to hurry off with a straight-sets victory over the 112th-ranked Angeles Montolio of Spain . \" It was very hot and I did n't want to stay long on the court , \" said a cheery Hingis , who had no worries in racing to a 6-1 6-0 victory against the overmatched Spaniard . Hoping for a longer engagement on the cement at Flushing Meadows were the sixth-seeded Huber of Germany and 12th seed Maleeva of Bulgaria . Huber , who lost to Monica Seles in the Australian Open final , fell victim to an unfortunate draw in bowing to dangerous floater Amanda Coetzer of South Africa . Coetzer , ranked 17th , avenged her defeat to Huber in the Australian Open semifinals by winning 6-1 2-6 6-2 . \" I looked at it as not a first round match , just a great challenge for me , \" said Coetzer , 24 . \" I was really concentrating on keeping my own momentum and my own rhythm . \" She is tough to play in that way because she plays very up and down . She played one great game and than a few errors . The challenge was just for me to keep playing my own game . \" Huber , who reached the final a week ago at Manhattan Beach , could only mourn her luck of the draw . \" I was n't happy when I saw the draw . She was the first non- seeded player , \" said the 21-year-old German . \" It 's always tough to play somebody like that in the first round in a Grand Slam . \" I think I did n't play that bad today . It was maybe my best first round match in a Grand Slam I ever played . \" Monday brought the best out in U.S. Open rookie Aleksandra Olsza of Poland , ranked 110th . The 18-year-old Olsza , last year 's Wimbledon junior champion , celebrated her debut in the main draw of the Open by removing Maleeva 6-4 6-2 . The curtain-raising victories by Hingis and Olsza provided a ringing endorsement for the newest wave of women 's players coming up from the junior ranks . The Swiss teenager , a twice French Open junior champion and a Wimbledon juniors winner , had already proven her main stage mettle by reaching the quarters at this year 's Australian Open . \" I hope I can get into the last 16 , \" said Hingis , seeded to face third seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the fourth round . Hingis has been working hard on conditioning and has lost eight pounds ( 3.5 kilos ) in advance of the championships . \" There will be tough matches but I hope I can get there , \" she said . \" Then we 'll see if Arantxa will be there , too . \" The fast-moving Olsza , 18 , was cool in her opening match . \" I was n't scared when I heard that I was playing Maleeva , \" said Olsza . \" I know that if I want to play professional tennis I have to do my best to try to beat her and I ca n't be scared . \" Olsza is undaunted by the level of competition in the pros . \" In terms of tennis , I think the junior players are really good now . In a few years , it could change a lot among the top players . \" Two big-serving women 's players made quick work of Japanese opponents . Brenda Schultz-McCarthy of the Netherlands , the 13th seed , was a 6-1 6-4 winner over Japan 's Nana Miyaga , while Czech veteran Helena Sukova prevailed over Yone Kamio 6-2 6-3 . Austrian Barbara Paulus , seeded 14th , also reached the second round with a 6-2 6-1 victory over Yi Jing-Qian of China .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 3659], "labels": [[[9, 14], "Q57401"], [[19, 26], "Q238102"], [[59, 63], "Unknown"], [[66, 76], "Unknown"], [[77, 85], "Q60"], [[97, 111], "Q134720"], [[138, 153], "Q60874"], [[163, 173], "Q57401"], [[178, 195], "Q238102"], [[256, 265], "Q123577"], [[305, 311], "Q134720"], [[387, 397], "Q102113"], [[401, 414], "Unknown"], [[489, 505], "Q2626756"], [[509, 514], "Q29"], [[598, 604], "Q134720"], [[681, 689], "Q160894"], [[740, 756], "Q1852081"], [[779, 784], "Q57401"], [[788, 795], "Q183"], [[810, 817], "Q238102"], [[821, 829], "Q219"], [[832, 837], "Q57401"], [[852, 864], "Q173633"], [[872, 887], "Q60874"], [[962, 976], "Q233339"], [[980, 992], "Q258"], [[995, 1002], "Q233339"], [[1041, 1046], "Q57401"], [[1054, 1069], "Q60874"], [[1191, 1198], "Q233339"], [[1466, 1471], "Q57401"], [[1510, 1525], "Q568610"], [[1670, 1676], "Q42884"], [[1751, 1761], "Q102113"], [[1850, 1860], "Q102113"], [[1910, 1919], "Q123577"], [[1927, 1943], "Q2437892"], [[1947, 1953], "Q36"], [[1987, 1992], "Q2437892"], [[2008, 2017], "Q41520"], [[2081, 2085], "Unknown"], [[2098, 2105], "Q238102"], [[2149, 2155], "Q134720"], [[2160, 2165], "Q2437892"], [[2275, 2280], "Q39"], [[2300, 2311], "Q43605"], [[2334, 2343], "Q41520"], [[2443, 2458], "Q60874"], [[2506, 2512], "Q134720"], [[2541, 2564], "Q188080"], [[2587, 2593], "Q134720"], [[2799, 2806], "Q182182"], [[2847, 2852], "Q2437892"], [[2943, 2950], "Q238102"], [[2960, 2965], "Q2437892"], [[3087, 3092], "Q2437892"], [[3337, 3345], "Q17"], [[3358, 3381], "Q269855"], [[3389, 3400], "Q55"], [[3445, 3450], "Q17"], [[3454, 3465], "Unknown"], [[3474, 3479], "Q213"], [[3488, 3501], "Q229151"], [[3517, 3527], "Unknown"], [[3538, 3546], "Q40"], [[3547, 3561], "Q272168"], [[3636, 3648], "Unknown"], [[3652, 3657], "Q148"]]}
{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "TENNIS - STICH GLAD HE STAYED AFTER OPEN VICTORY . Richard Finn NEW YORK 1996-08-26 Michael Stich nearly pulled out of the U.S. Open in protest over the men 's seeding fiasco but the former Wimbledon champion was glad he stayed after sweating out a four-set win on Monday over qualifier Tommy Haas . \" I still feel it 's embarrassing what happened and I was about to pull out yesterday and say , ' That 's it , ' \" said Stich , one of a host of men who cried foul over seeding procedures that forced an unprecedented remaking of the men 's draw last week . \" But there are so many reasons to play , especially spectators and the kids who come out here and want to enjoy watching tennis , that I decided to stay . \" In a break from tradition , the Open did not seed in strict accordance with ATP rankings , instead taking into account other factors that raised objections of favourtism toward U.S. players . One prominent player that did not stay for the Open was French Open champion Yvegeny Kafelnikov , who after being dropped three spots from his ATP ranking to a seventh seeding , withdrew and returned home to Russia . Kafelnikov had pulled out of last week 's tournament with a rib injury . At a news conference attended by approximately 50 players on Sunday , U.S. Davis Cup player Todd Martin expressed the players ' outrage at the seedings . \" The way the U.S. Open has seeded here , tampering with the ranking system , has tarnished the image and reputation of this U.S. Open in the players ' mind , and we think that is damaging to our sport , \" Martin said . Stich said he felt the players ought to have organised an active protest . \" I feel that we made it a little easy for the USTA . They did n't really get hurt as much as I think they should have , \" said Stich . \" I feel that we should have maybe just cancelled out the Monday , not show up today and start the tournament tomorrow . \" But once the 27-year-old Stich got on the court , he focused his energies on trying to win the year 's last Grand Slam . He took a positive first step with his 6-3 1-6 6-1 7-5 win over compatriot Haas on a sun-baked Grandstand court . Others advancing early on Monday included 11th-seeded American Malivai Washington , the Wimbledon runner-up , Sweden 's Magnus Gustafsson , and two-time former French Open champion Sergi Bruguera of Spain , who will be Stich 's next opponent . The suspicion , however , lingers in Stich 's mind that U.S. Open officials did tamper with the seeding process in order to benefit homegrown players . \" I get the feeling that everything is done here for the American players and they forget about all the other players , \" said Stich , who lost the 1994 Open final to Andre Agassi . It was Agassi who was at the centre of the controversy that engulfed the tournament since the original draw was completed on Wednesday . The flamboyant American star was bumped up two spots from his ATP ranking of eight to a seeding of six . \" He ( Agassi ) should be seeded the way he is playing tennis right now , \" said Stich about the unfairness of moving up Agassi , who made early exits from the French Open and Wimbledon . Stich , not seeded here for the first time since 1990 , might have benefitted from some fiddling with the seedings himself after Kafelnikov withdrew . Ranked 18th in the world , Stich might have been slipped into that spot ahead of Spain 's Felix Mantilla , who is 16th but had never been played in the Open and had been left out of the seedings originally . But Stich did n't want to play that game . \" I think he deserves to be seeded as everybody else who is in the top 16 deserves to be seeded , \" Stich said .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 3662], "labels": [[[9, 14], "Q60109"], [[36, 40], "Unknown"], [[51, 63], "Unknown"], [[64, 72], "Q60"], [[84, 97], "Q60109"], [[123, 132], "Q123577"], [[190, 199], "Q41520"], [[287, 297], "Q53560"], [[420, 425], "Q60109"], [[747, 751], "Unknown"], [[791, 794], "Q744089"], [[892, 896], "Q30"], [[954, 958], "Unknown"], [[963, 974], "Q43605"], [[984, 1002], "Unknown"], [[1050, 1053], "Q744089"], [[1115, 1121], "Q159"], [[1124, 1134], "Q207705"], [[1267, 1271], "Q30"], [[1272, 1281], "Q132377"], [[1289, 1300], "Q54536"], [[1365, 1374], "Q123577"], [[1476, 1485], "Q123577"], [[1557, 1563], "Q54536"], [[1571, 1576], "Q60109"], [[1693, 1697], "Q1156323"], [[1774, 1779], "Q60109"], [[1930, 1935], "Q60109"], [[2013, 2023], "Q102113"], [[2101, 2105], "Q53560"], [[2121, 2131], "Unknown"], [[2194, 2202], "Q30"], [[2203, 2221], "Q54691"], [[2228, 2237], "Q41520"], [[2250, 2256], "Q34"], [[2260, 2277], "Q737996"], [[2300, 2311], "Q43605"], [[2321, 2335], "Q311177"], [[2339, 2344], "Q29"], [[2359, 2364], "Q60109"], [[2421, 2426], "Q60109"], [[2440, 2449], "Q123577"], [[2593, 2601], "Q30"], [[2663, 2668], "Q60109"], [[2689, 2693], "Unknown"], [[2703, 2715], "Q7407"], [[2725, 2731], "Q7407"], [[2870, 2878], "Q30"], [[2917, 2920], "Q744089"], [[2967, 2973], "Q7407"], [[3041, 3046], "Q60109"], [[3081, 3087], "Q7407"], [[3120, 3131], "Q43605"], [[3136, 3145], "Q41520"], [[3148, 3153], "Q60109"], [[3277, 3287], "Q207705"], [[3326, 3331], "Q60109"], [[3380, 3385], "Q29"], [[3389, 3403], "Q449730"], [[3451, 3455], "Unknown"], [[3511, 3516], "Q60109"], [[3650, 3655], "Q60109"]]}

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "BASEBALL - BONDS ' CONSECUTIVE GAME STREAK ENDS . SAN FRANCISCO 1996-08-25 San Francisco Giants All-Star left fielder Barry Bonds did not appear in Sunday 's 7-2 victory over the Montreal Expos , ending his consecutive games streak . After appearing as a pinch-hitter in the previous two games , Bonds , who has been battling a hamstring injury , did not see any action today , ending his streak at 357 consecutive games . It was the second-longest streak by an active player in the the majors behind Baltimore 's Cal Ripken , who appeared in his major-league record 2,282nd straight game today , a 13-0 loss to the California Angels . Bonds has been limited to a pinch-hitting role since an MRI Friday showed a mild strain of his left hamstring . Bonds came out of Wednesday 's game against New York in the ninth inning after suffering a mild hamstring strain . He was back in the starting lineup Thursday night and went 1-for-2 before exiting in the third inning .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "OSCE delays decision on refugee voting . Kurt Schork SARAJEVO 1996-08-26 Bosnia 's election organisers will decide on Tuesday whether or not to postpone municipal elections scheduled as part of nationwide balloting , an OSCE spokeswoman said on Monday . Officials from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) are considering the postponement following allegations of serious irregularities in the registration of Serb refugees . International observers say the alleged irregularities could affect the outcome of voting for municipal assemblies . \" Tomorrow ... the Provisional Election Commission will consider the possible postponement of municipal elections only ... the other elections will be held on September 14 , \" OSCE spokeswoman Agota Kuperman told reporters in Sarajevo . \" I think that it would be very difficult to select which municipal elections would have to be cancelled . I think probably if the decision ( to cancell ) were to be taken it would probably be all municipal elections .. . \" Kuperman added that options other than postponement were also on the table , but she refused to specify what they were . The Dayton peace agreement gave the OSCE a mandate to organise Bosnian elections . The Provisional Election Commission is OSCE 's top rule-making body for the poll . More than 600,000 refugees have registered to vote in 55 countries around the world , representing about 20 per cent of Bosnia 's total electorate . They are due to begin voting on Wednesday , August 28 , just one day after the PEC is supposed to make its decision . Balloting inside Bosnia is scheduled for September 14 , when citizens are slated to elect municipal and cantonal assemblies , separate Moslem-Croat and Serb parliaments , a national House of Representatives and a three-man Presidency . A Sarajevo daily newspaper , Dnevi Avaz , which is close to Bosnia 's Moslem nationalist SDA party , on Monday said the OSCE would postpone the municipal-level elections until the Spring of 1997 because of the refugee registration problems . SDA has a representative on the Provisional Election Commission . \" I do n't know what the source of the Dnevi Avaz report is , but it is consistent with what I have heard from western diplomats and from inside the OSCE , \" said an OSCE staff member in Sarajevo who asked not to be named . \" The word is that Frowick has decided to postpone municipal elections but that he will wait for one more session of the PEC on Tuesday to take everyone 's temperature on the issue . \" Ambassador Robert Frowick , an American , heads the OSCE mission in Bosnia . OSCE and independent monitors allege that Serb authorities have systematically discouraged refugees from registering to cast a ballot in the places they lived before the war . Instead , the refugees were said to have been directed by their authorities to vote from strategic towns which had Moslem majorities before the 43-month Bosnian war , but which are now underpopulated as a result of \" ethnic cleansing \" .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "After truce , Lebed faces tougher Chechen problem . Alastair Macdonald MOSCOW 1996-08-26 Alexander Lebed may finally get to discuss his Chechen peace proposals with Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday after a lost weekend in the region when he was forced to abandon plans to sign a new political treaty with the separatist rebels . It could be a sobering experience for the Kremlin security chief who , just two months after being appointed by the president and two heady weeks after taking charge of the Chechen crisis , had promised to wrap up the 20-month war by the weekend . Despite a mood of compromise in the region after some of the worst fighting of the war , Lebed may be just finding out that concluding a long-term settlement , somewhere between rebel demands for independence and Moscow 's insistence that Chechnya remain part of Russia , will be no easy matter . A chain-smoking former paratroop general with a sharp line in deadpan putdowns and a soldier 's knack for making life sound simple , Lebed managed to arrange an ambitious ceasefire in the region last week , days after the Russian army threatened to bomb its way back into the rebel-held Chechen capital Grozny . He returned at the weekend , pledging to conclude a political settlement that would make this truce work where all others have failed . But then he apparently thought better of it . Saying he needed to tidy up legal loose ends on the deal -- and also cover his back against unnamed pro-war schemers in Moscow -- he flew back to the capital empty-handed on Sunday . He met Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on Monday and , according to the press service of Lebed 's Security Council , could meet Yeltsin on Tuesday . It was not clear if the start of Yeltsin 's holiday , announced later , would affect plans to talk . Moscow 's as yet undisclosed proposals on Chechnya 's political future have , meanwhile , been sent back to do the rounds of various government departments . It is not known what caused the delay in the peace plan . Speculation mounted last week that Lebed was operating out on a limb in Chechnya as Yeltsin , hardly seen since his reelection last month , kept out of sight and then gave an interview criticising his envoy just as he clinched a truce . But Chernomyrdin took pains at the weekend to insist Lebed was playing for a united team and that the proposals he took to rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov had been agreed by Yeltsin . If that were the case , it was unclear why Lebed suddenly found it necessary to have the deal verified in Moscow . Lebed himself said he was concerned that powerful interests in Moscow , who have profited from the war and want it to go on , would seize on any inadequacy in the deal to remove him . Maskhadov warned that Lebed risked the same fate as a former Russian army commander in the region who sought a compromise and was blown up last year by -- so the Chechens say -- Russian forces . Maskhadov may also have made new demands on Lebed , forcing him to check back with the Kremlin on what he could offer . A rebel spokesman said the two military men had come close to agreement on a face-saving formula acceptable to both sides and involving a referendum on independence at some future date . Chernomyrdin said voters should decide Chechnya 's future but stressed there was no question of the government letting the region quit the Russian Federation -- something Moscow fears could encourage separatist tendencies in other ethnic regions , particularly in the strategic North Caucasus . Lebed may be be finding that closing that political gap between the two sides is more difficult than just ending a war .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 3662], "labels": [[[14, 19], "Q295898"], [[34, 41], "Q5187"], [[52, 70], "Unknown"], [[71, 77], "Q649"], [[89, 104], "Q295898"], [[136, 143], "Q5187"], [[165, 178], "Q34453"], [[363, 370], "Q133274"], [[494, 501], "Q5187"], [[658, 663], "Q295898"], [[782, 788], "Q649"], [[808, 816], "Q5187"], [[832, 838], "Q159"], [[999, 1004], "Q295898"], [[1088, 1095], "Q159"], [[1153, 1160], "Q5187"], [[1169, 1175], "Q5196"], [[1480, 1486], "Q649"], [[1550, 1557], "Q159"], [[1573, 1592], "Q190884"], [[1643, 1648], "Q295898"], [[1652, 1668], "Q672108"], [[1682, 1689], "Q34453"], [[1736, 1743], "Q34453"], [[1804, 1810], "Q1140115"], [[1846, 1854], "Q5187"], [[2055, 2060], "Q295898"], [[2092, 2100], "Q5187"], [[2104, 2111], "Q34453"], [[2261, 2273], "Q190884"], [[2310, 2315], "Q295898"], [[2401, 2416], "Q193354"], [[2436, 2443], "Q34453"], [[2489, 2494], "Q295898"], [[2552, 2558], "Q649"], [[2561, 2566], "Q295898"], [[2624, 2630], "Q649"], [[2745, 2754], "Q193354"], [[2767, 2772], "Q295898"], [[2806, 2813], "Q159"], [[2907, 2915], "Q5187"], [[2923, 2930], "Q159"], [[2940, 2949], "Q193354"], [[2984, 2989], "Q295898"], [[3027, 3034], "Q1140115"], [[3247, 3259], "Q190884"], [[3286, 3294], "Q5187"], [[3386, 3404], "Q159"], [[3418, 3424], "Q649"], [[3525, 3539], "Q37736"], [[3542, 3547], "Q295898"]]}

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "Gore presents new image of lead attack dog . Michael Posner CHICAGO 1996-08-26 No more mild-mannered and meek Al Gore , the vice president and likely heir apparent to President Bill Clinton , emerged on Monday as the new Democratic attack dog leading a front-line assault on Bob Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich . While Clinton takes a train trip to the Democratic Convention that will renominate him on Wednesday for a second term , Gore is the bright star in the convention city now . Crowds anxiously wait for his appearances , thrusting out hands for him to grip as they scream \" 12 more years \" -- a wishful hope to eight years of Gore after a Clinton re-election . Over a 15-hour span from Sunday evening to Monday morning , so many people jammed Gore events that the fire marshal stopped members of Congress , reporters and others from entering a pro-Israel rally and a meeting of the New York delegation . In his appearances , the often stiff and wooden Gore seemed transformed into a new energetic , gesturing \" pol \" as he ripped into Republican presidential nominee Dole and Gingrich , who has emerged as the favorite right-wing foil of Democrats . Gore told a roaring labor rally of about 1,000 union workers that Dole and Gingrich were the virtual personifaction of evil , without even mentioning that former Housing Secretary Jack Kemp is Dole 's running mate . \" With equal measures of ignorance and audacity this two-headed monster of Dole and Gingrich has been launching an all out assault on decades of progress of behalf of working men and women , \" Gore said to whoops of \" 12 more years . \" \" They want to drive you out of politics and they ca n't , \" he added . \" They want to silence your voices in elections . \" At a downtown hotel Monday , the 48-year-old Gore gave Wisconsin delegates a taste again of the new Gore . \" I want you to ask this question . What would Wisconsin face if the same extremist coalition , the Gingrich / Dole Congress , also controlled the executive branch ? \" Gore said . Noting the next presidential term will probably see two or three Supreme Court justice nominations , he warned , \" Their extremist agenda would come out of the Gingrich Congress , into and through the Dole White House , down through the Supreme Court . \" He painted a scene of horrors he saw if Republicans controlled the White House and the Congress they hold now . \" Our personal and religious liberties would be at risk . Medicare would be at risk of withering on the vine . Medicaid would be at risk of being taken away from poor children . Education would be at risk . The environment would be at risk from the polluters that control that coalition , \" he said .

We got burned once and we wo n't let that happen to our nation again . \" Gore ridiculed Dole 's defense of the tobacco industry , praised Clinton for \" courage \" in advancing regulations of it . To the delegates of Wisconsin , a leading dairy state , Gore had the right audience in poking fun at Dole 's comparison to addiction to tobacco to those who ca n't tolerate milk . \" Some people say milk is bad for you , \" Gore said as Wisconsin delegates held aloft a plastic inflated cow . He praised Clinton for vetoing the Republican Congress ' attempt to repeal parts of the Clean Air Act , and criticized Republicans for \" slashing money to combat drugs in schools . \" \" The choice has never been starker , the stakes today have never been higher , \" Gore said . \" We 're not going to let them get away with that . \"", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 3911], "labels": [[[0, 4], "Q19673"], [[45, 59], "Unknown"], [[60, 67], "Q1297"], [[110, 117], "Q19673"], [[177, 189], "Q1124"], [[221, 231], "Q29552"], [[275, 283], "Q319079"], [[288, 293], "Unknown"], [[302, 315], "Q182788"], [[324, 331], "Q1124"], [[358, 379], "Q1185865"], [[438, 442], "Q19673"], [[640, 644], "Q19673"], [[653, 660], "Q1124"], [[757, 761], "Q19673"], [[810, 818], "Q11268"], [[858, 868], "Unknown"], [[896, 904], "Q60"], [[966, 970], "Q19673"], [[1049, 1059], "Q29468"], [[1081, 1085], "Q319079"], [[1090, 1098], "Q182788"], [[1152, 1161], "Q29552"], [[1164, 1168], "Q19673"], [[1230, 1234], "Q319079"], [[1239, 1247], "Q182788"], [[1344, 1353], "Q357676"], [[1357, 1361], "Q319079"], [[1455, 1459], "Q319079"], [[1464, 1472], "Q182788"], [[1573, 1577], "Q19673"], [[1785, 1789], "Q19673"], [[1795, 1804], "Q1537"], [[1840, 1844], "Q19673"], [[1894, 1903], "Q1537"], [[1947, 1971], "Unknown"], [[2015, 2019], "Q19673"], [[2092, 2105], "Q11201"], [[2187, 2204], "Unknown"], [[2228, 2244], "Unknown"], [[2264, 2277], "Q11201"], [[2322, 2333], "Q29468"], [[2349, 2360], "Q35525"], [[2369, 2377], "Q11268"], [[2452, 2460], "Q559392"], [[2505, 2513], "Unknown"], [[2729, 2740], "Q29468"], [[2858, 2867], "Q1537"], [[2891, 2898], "Q30"], [[2941, 2953], "Q1124"], [[2958, 2962], "Q319079"], [[3168, 3172], "Q19673"], [[3183, 3187], "Q319079"], [[3233, 3240], "Q1124"], [[3310, 3319], "Q1537"], [[3346, 3350], "Q19673"], [[3391, 3395], "Q319079"], [[3512, 3516], "Q19673"], [[3525, 3534], "Q1537"], [[3592, 3599], "Q1124"], [[3616, 3626], "Q29468"], [[3627, 3635], "Q11268"], [[3669, 3682], "Unknown"], [[3700, 3711], "Q29468"], [[3846, 3850], "Q19673"]]}
{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "Actor Reeve highlights Democrats ' first night . CHICAGO 1996-08-26 The highlights of the first day of the Democratic convention on Monday were expected to feature a mix of party leaders and people who have overcome adversity . Among the latter were gun control advocate Sarah Brady and actor Christopher Reeve and the politicians included Rep . Richard Gephardt and Sen . Thomas Daschle . Here are thumbnail profiles of the convention 's key Monday speakers . Sarah Brady -- The nation 's toughest gun control law is named after Ronald Reagan 's press secretary James Brady but it was his wife who was the major force behind its passage . As head of Handgun Control Inc. , Sarah Brady , 54 , campaigned nonstop for tough gun control in the years following the shooting of her husband and then President Reagan in 1981 . Her reward was the passage in 1993 of the \" Brady Bill \" which requires a mandatory five-day waiting period for purchase of handguns and also mandates background checks for would-be gun purchasers . Reagan recovered fully from his wounds but Brady , who was close to death after being shot by John Hinckley Jr . , suffered serious brain damage . Sarah was Brady 's second wife and they have a son , James Scott Brady Jr . Before the assassination attempt , she had worked for Republican congressmen and for the Republican Party . Christopher Reeve -- Reeve was best known for playing the comic book hero Superman in four movies but his greatest heroics came in real life . Reeve , an accomplished rider who owned several horses , suffered multiple injuries including two shattered neck vertebrae when he was thrown from his horse at an equestrian event in Culpepper , Virginia , on May 27 , 1995 . Almost entirely paralyzed , Reeve underwent extensive surgery to fuse the vertebrae to the base of the skull and prevent any further damage to his spine . That allowed him to be moved to a semi-upright position . Over time he regained the power of speech , so much so that he was asked to address the opening night of the Democratic National Convention . Reeve , 43 , was classically trained as an actor but became the prototypical handsome leading man . He performed in summer stock and soap operas before being plucked as an almost unknown to play the lead in \" Superman \" and three sequels . Richard Gephardt -- Gephardt , House Democratic leader , is a politician with a \" Mr Clean \" reputation who sought the presidency eight years ago and is widely believed to still have ambitions for the job . Gephardt , 55 , the son of a milkman from a working class district of St. Louis , is a consummate congressional insider , sufficiently skilled in compromise and the ways of the legislature to manage the often-unruly House Democrats . A former lawyer , he was in the front line of President Bill Clinton 's battle with the Republican-led Congress over the budget but has opposed the president 's decision to sign the Republican-written welfare reform bill . He advocated tough action against foreign countries to cut U.S. trade deficits but sometimes been out of step with the party 's liberal wing . He was an opponent of abortion until 1986 and voted for President Ronald Reagan 's big tax cut bill . Gephardt , a red-haired square-jawed man , is a less than fiery orator . His 1988 bid for the Democratic nomination only took off after he recreated himself as a firebreathing reformer of the establishment , standing up for blue collar workers and farmers . Tom Daschle -- Daschle , 48 , was largely unknown outside Washington and his state of South Dakota when he surprisingly beat more prominent rivals to become Senate Democratic leader after the party lost its majority to the Republicans in 1994 . A mild-mannered and youthful man who rose rapidly after entering the Senate in 1987 , he presented himself as a Midwest moderate , as a Democratic winner in a Republican state able to unite Senate factions . Concern that he might be steamrollered by the vastly more experienced Republican leader Bob Dole was dispelled when he showed a tough edge , outmaneuvering Dole in a wrangle over scrapping a gas tax and raising the federal minimum wage . In his early Senate years he was seen as a \" prairie populist \" , working on legislation protecting farmers ' prices and also on compensating veterans sickened by Agent Orange defoliant spraying in the Vietnam War .

PARIS 1996-08-26 Former businessman and soccer boss Bernard Tapie said that he would give up his seat in the National Assembly by Wednesday , the day a film by Claude Lelouche in which he stars opens in France . \" I will no longer be deputy by the time the film opens , \" he said in a broadcast interview . \" Just about , \" he told Europe 1 radio when asked whether he had sent his letter of resignation to Assembly speaker Philippe Seguin . A Seguin spokeswoman confirmed that no letter or call had yet been received . Tapie , 53 , was resigning just ahead of expected government action to eject him from the Assembly following a finding by the Supreme Court that he was bankrupt and thus ineligible for public office for a five-year period . Tapie , the target of a blizzard of legal actions over his now-destroyed business empire and the Marseille soccer team he once ran , has a starring role in Lelouche 's \" Homme , femmes : mode d'emploi \" ( Men , women : instructions for use ) . He plays a power-hungry lawyer in the movie described as \" a tender and cruel comedy \" by Lelouche , who is making his 35th film . \" I have paid too dearly for mixing two careers , \" Tapie said . \" In France , you cannot be a film artist and a national politician at the same time . That is why I will no longer be deputy by the time the film opens . \" Justice Minister Jacques Toubon began last month the formal process of ejecting Tapie from the French parliament as well as stripping him of his seat in the European parliament . The French procedure was expected to be completed before October 2 , when the National Assembly is to reconvene after a summer break , but the European procedure was expected to take longer . Tapie 's lawyer has said he intends to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights in an effort to prevent or delay the loss of his European seat .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "FOCUS - Eurobourses end mixed but London recovers . Leonard Santorelli LONDON 1996-08-27 European bourses closed mixed on Tuesday with London clawing back most of the day 's losses despite an unsteady start on wall Street , hit by inflation worries . The dollar weakened during the day with many dealers sidelined because of uncertainty over Tokyo 's monetary direction ahead of the important Japanese Tankan economic survey out on Wednesday . But it recovered at the close of trade . Stocks in London started the week badly after a three-day weekend , slipping 0.3 percent , but bargain-hunters later moved in and the FTSE index recovered most of the lost ground to end only just in negative ground . Tuesday 's patchy showing in London followed a string of records last week , culminating in Friday 's trading high of 3,911 , fuelled by a wave of European interest rate cuts . The London bourse drew little help from the unsettled morning on Wall Street , which slipped in and out of positive ground after a stronger-than-expected August consumer confidence report refuelled inflation fears , pulling U.S. Treasuries back from their early peaks . Shortly after the report appeared showing the confidence index rising to 109.4 in August from a revised 107.0 in July , Wall Street relinquished virtually all its morning gains . \" Treasuries remain very sensitive to any indication of a strong economy and we 're still in that summer doldrum period of light trading , \" said Alan Ackerman , market strategist at Fahnestock & Co . \" Consequently , stocks and bonds are both subject to rapid swings . \" Frankfurt was the one bright spot in Europe . Floor trading ended up 0.25 percent and the computerised IBIS index climbed nearly 0.4 percent , given a push by the performance of chemical shares . \" The market is trading 100 percent on fundamentals at the moment as interest rate fantasy disappears -- it 's all company news , \" said one trader . French shares ended slightly down amid growing unease about a difficult autumn for the government which also weighed on the franc , dealers said . Bond prices were weaker and the franc was quoted at 3.4210 per mark for the first time since August 13 as worries about the government 's autumn budget and a weak U.S. currency lifted the mark and squeezed French investments . The dollar , which dropped sharply on Monday because of jitters over the Japanese Tankan survey , weakened further in quiet trading but regained losses to end the day close to Monday 's levels . \" Besides the Tankan , there 's nothing really until the U.S. jobs numbers next week , \" said a UK bank corporate dealer . \" There is still the summer malaise hanging over the market . \" Foreign exchange markets regard the Tankan report as an important indication of the country 's future monetary policy direction . If it points to weakness in the economy , the report will help the dollar regain some lost ground as speculation of a near-term rise in Japanese interest rates will evaporate . The Japanese discount rate is currently at a record low of 0.5 percent . The dollar was also pressured by the mark 's strength against European currencies amid renewed concerns over Europe 's economic and monetary union ( EMU ) timetable . CURRENCIES The dollar was at 1.4788 marks and 107.74 yen at the close of European trading compared with 1.4789 marks and 107.55 yen on Monday . STOCK MARKETS The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares ended 1.8 points lower at 3,905.7 . In Paris , the CAC-40 share index finished down 2.43 at 2,017.99 .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "FEATURE - \" Eco terrorists \" target UK builders . Edna Fernandes LONDON 1996-08-27 Ecological warfare has broken out across the British construction industry , striking some of the biggest corporates as activists give up peaceful protests and seek to hit builders where it hurts -- their profit margins . Described by one British company as \" eco-terrorism \" , it is seen as the new business risk of the 1990s . Famous names like Tarmac Plc , Costain Group Plc and ARC , a unit of conglomerate Hanson Plc , have all been targeted . Activist groups are no longer seen by British firms as a harmless , badly organised ragbag of students and hippies . \" You only have to see them in action at protests , \" said David Harding , spokesman at ARC , Hanson 's aggregates company . \" They walk around with mobile phones and camera equipment , they communicate and gather support for demos via the Internet -- we 're talking about a highly sophisticated organisation . \" One road protestor under the codename Steady Eddie told construction journal \" Building \" earlier this year , \" If it comes down to full-scale economic warfare , we will aim to drive them out of business . \" As well as financial threats , companies also emphasise the \" terror \" tactics used . Costain 's contract to build the controversial Newbury bypass , which runs through a conservation area , has led to violent protests delaying building , bomb threats , staff intimidation and picketing of chief executive Alan Lovell 's home . A Costain spokesman told Reuters : \" We 've had all sorts of protests at the head office and the chief executive 's house . But it 's when it gets to the ( employee ) families -- that it goes across the line . \" Tactics used by some underground groups including the cryptic Berkshire Wood Elves , which distribute leaflets with instructions on home-made explosives , are now the subject of a police investigation . Other larger activist groups include Earth First , The Land is Ours , Alarm UK and Road Alert . The groups have targeted specific projects like the Newbury bypass and the M3 motorway through Twyford Down in the southern county of Hampshire . But they are also campaigning on broader issue such as stopping the government road building programme and out-of-town superstores which they say create more traffic , pollution and damage local communities . The government has slashed its road-building spending . Although protests may have contributed to the decision it has been seen primarily as economic rather than ecological . Graham Watts , chief executive of the Construction Industry Council , said : \" I do n't think many firms involved in tendering for sensitive projects realise the impact environmental activity has on the cost of running a project . \" But they are more alert than they were 3-4 years ago . There 's no doubt it 's a big issue now . \" He says the damage comes in two forms : \" Tangible -- in the form of extra costs , additional security , threats to staff and the more intangible damage caused by negative publicity . \" Watts said the cost of protesting can be heavy once the company is locked into a contract . \" I do often hear on the industry circuit of tales where the company tenders at low margins and the demonstrations which follow means they are running the project at a loss . \" ARC says it 's not just contractors in the front line but also suppliers like itself . Its own quarries came under attack after it emerged that it may be a supplier for the Newbury bypass . \" It was called the \" First Battle of the Newbury bypass ' , \" said ARC 's Harding . \" We had 300 Earth First protestors invade and occupy our site . Hundreds of thousands of pounds ( dollars ) of damage was done in one day . Plus there was the knock-on cost of lost production and extra security in future . \" Simon Brown , analyst at investement bank UBS , said this new phenomenon has led to a change in the way the industry evaluates project risk . \" When talking to Tarmac about the M3 link ( through Twyford Down ) they made it fairly clear that their risk assessment methods have been changed and now involve a very clear environmental risk analysis . \" Harding says others have done the same . \" As a result of eco-terrorism we are looking at controversial jobs more closely to see if the profit margins are wide enough to cover things like extra security . \" For an industry already suffering from razor-thin margins , overcapacity and stagnant demand , eco-terrorism is the latest bizarre twist in the construction sector 's tale of woe .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 4564], "labels": [[[36, 38], "Unknown"], [[50, 64], "Unknown"], [[65, 71], "Q84"], [[128, 135], "Q145"], [[322, 329], "Q145"], [[430, 440], "Unknown"], [[443, 460], "Unknown"], [[465, 468], "Q4739364"], [[494, 504], "Q505012"], [[570, 577], "Q145"], [[708, 721], "Unknown"], [[737, 740], "Q4739364"], [[743, 749], "Q505012"], [[889, 897], "Q466"], [[1000, 1012], "Unknown"], [[1041, 1049], "Q4986440"], [[1256, 1263], "Q5174993"], [[1303, 1310], "Q655874"], [[1476, 1487], "Unknown"], [[1500, 1507], "Q5174993"], [[1523, 1530], "Q130879"], [[1772, 1792], "Unknown"], [[1950, 1961], "Unknown"], [[1964, 1980], "Q7745361"], [[1983, 1991], "Unknown"], [[1996, 2006], "Unknown"], [[2061, 2068], "Q655874"], [[2084, 2086], "Unknown"], [[2104, 2116], "Q7859527"], [[2143, 2152], "Q23204"], [[2539, 2551], "Unknown"], [[2577, 2606], "Q5164426"], [[3057, 3062], "Unknown"], [[3326, 3329], "Q4739364"], [[3499, 3506], "Q655874"], [[3538, 3572], "Unknown"], [[3584, 3587], "Q4739364"], [[3591, 3598], "Unknown"], [[3614, 3625], "Unknown"], [[3827, 3838], "Unknown"], [[3869, 3872], "Q193199"], [[3987, 3993], "Q16995829"], [[4004, 4006], "Unknown"], [[4022, 4034], "Q7859527"], [[4177, 4184], "Unknown"]]}

Trailing by a run entering the 11th , the Orioles rallied against Oakland reliever Mark Acre ( 0-2 ) with a walk and a triple by Brady Anderson to tie the game . Then Oakland manager Art Howe decided to intentionally walk Rafael Palmeiro and Bobby Bonilla to load the bases but Acre was nowhere near the plate to Ripken . The decisive pitch nearly hit Ripken and gave the Orioles a one-half game lead over the Chicago White Sox in the wild-card race . In Seattle , Jay Buhner 's eighth-inning single snapped a tie as the Seattle Mariners edged the New York Yankees 2-1 in the opener of a three-game series . New York starter Jimmy Key left the game in the first inning after Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez lined a shot off his left elbow .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "TENNIS - CHANG , WASHINGTON ADVANCE , TWO WOMEN 'S SEEDS FALL . Larry Fine NEW YORK 1996-08-26 Michael Chang is playing in his 10th U.S. Open and enjoying his highest seeding ever , but the 24-year-old American had to overcome a case of the jitters Monday before winning his first-round match on opening day . Chang , seeded second behind defending champion Pete Sampras , took two hours 40 minutes to defeat 186th-ranked Jaime Oncins of Brazil 3-6 6-1 6-0 7-6 , 8-6 in the tiebreaker . \" I was pretty tight the whole match , \" conceded Chang , one of the hottest players on tour this summer with a 16-2 record on hardcourts that included two titles and a runner-up finish . \" Everyone has moments when they get tight . Hopefully , this will have been my nerves for the whole tournament . \" Joining Chang into the second round was Wimbledon runner-up MaliVai Washington , the 11th seed , who also needed four sets to get past talented Moroccan Karim Alami 6-4 2-6 7-6 ( 7-5 ) 6-1 . Washington 's win was not comfortable , either . The 27-year-old American hurried off the Stadium Court for treatment of an upset stomach after his two and a half hour struggle against Alami . \" Towards the end of my match my stomach felt like week-old sushi , \" said Washington . \" Maybe it was a combination of the heat and something I ate . \" Chang and Washington were the only men 's seeds in action on a day that saw two seeded women 's players fall . Australian Open runner-up Anke Huber of Germany , the sixth seed , was undone by an unlucky draw that put her against 17th ranked South African Amanda Coetzer in her opening match . Coetzer claimed revenge for the semifinal defeat she suffered to Huber in Melbourne by taking a 6-1 2-6 6-2 victory . Last year 's Wimbledon junior champion , Aleksandra Olsza of Poland , removed another seed from the draw by eliminating number 12 Magdalena Maleeva of Bulgaria 6-4 6-2 . Other men 's winners included a pair of former Grand Slam tournament champions whose victories set up a showdown in the second round . Germany 's Michael Stich , the 1991 Wimbledon champion , and two-time French Open winner Sergi Bruguera of Spain will face each other next after beating German Tommy Haas 6-3 1-6 6-1 7-5 , and Belgian Kris Goossens 6-2 6-0 7-6 ( 7-1 ) , respectively . Alex O'Brien , who scored his first professional title eight days ago in New Haven , advanced to the second round with a 6-4 1-6 6-4 6-3 win over Ecuador 's Nicolas Lapentti . Wimbledon bad boy Jeff Tarango caught a break Monday when he advanced after the retirement of German Alex Radulescu due to heat exhaustion . Tarango was leading 6-7 ( 5-7 ) 6-4 6-1 3-1 . Chang blamed breezy conditions for some of the erratic play in his match with Oncins , who had beaten him in the round of 32 at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics . Chang committed an untidy 53 unforced errors , though he made seven fewer than the Brazilian , who also walloped a woeful 24 double faults . The most deflating double fault came when Oncins was serving to force a fifth set , leading 6-4 in the tiebreaker . The set point came after confusion at the net on the point previous , which was awarded to Oncins after the two exchanged shots at close quarters at the net . First Chang approached the umpire , then Oncins , then Chang again before play finally resumed . \" Those little seconds were like an hour to me , \" said Oncins , who promptly fired two serves barely contained by the baseline as he frittered away his best chance . Chang ran off the next three points to close out the match but for Oncins , the contest was a personal victory . The 26-year-old Brazilian had risen into the top 30 in 1992 . The next year a close friend was struck by a stray bullet while riding home in a car from a soccer game in Sao Paulo . He died slumped against Oncins , who subsequently lost interest in tennis . \" Two months ago I started talking about quitting , \" said Oncins , who decided to give it one last try and made it through the Open qualifying tournament last weekend . \" I believe in my game again , \" he said .

The French-registered packaging materials company , which floated its shares in Hungary in July , for most of the past two weeks hovered below the 6,425 forints / Global Depositary Receipts price of its initial offering , which was oversubscribed . The company , which asked for a two-week delay from the usual August 15 deadline for reporting first-half results , closed on Tuesday at 5,800 forints , down 300 . \" Cofinec 's first-half figures will be ... between one-third of two-fifths of its annual plan , \" said Tamas Erdei , a Budapest-based analyst for ABN-AMRO Hoare Govett . Analysts blame , at least partly , Hungary 's macroeconomic environment for the weaker figures for Cofinec which , operating in Hungary , Poland and the Czech Republic , now generates about 55 to 60 percent of its annual sales from Hungary . Hungary 's Gross Domestic Product fell one percentage point in the first quarter while real wages plunged 7.2 percentage points in the first half of 1996 . Both will have their impact on Cofinec 's figures , the analysts said . Despite the current difficulties , however , analysts were convinced that Cofinec 's outlook was strong . \" The eastern European market offers good chances , \" said Erdei . \" Just like many other companies on the bourse , Cofinec has big growth opportunities . \" \" At the same time , it 's an advantage for Cofinec that it has a foreign management which perhaps understands the market better , \" Erdei added . \" Cofinec is a very good story in the long-term as the per capita packaging consumption is still so low in east Europe that a very strong increase can be expected ( long-term ) , \" Sitanyi said , saying that several recent moves by Cofinec boosted its position . Among them , he noted that Cofinec had acquired the outstanding stake in its Czech folding company Krpaco a.s. , increasing its ownership to 100 percent , so in the second half the whole of Krpaco 's figures will be consolidated . The company also repaid some $ 21 million of debt , well above the originally planned $ 8 million to $ 9 million . In addition , its Polish operation began with some six weeks of delay due to cold winter weather and the test run was also longer than planned . -- Budapest newsroom ( 36 1 ) 266 2410", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 2767], "labels": [[[0, 7], "Unknown"], [[17, 25], "Q1781"], [[53, 65], "Unknown"], [[66, 74], "Q1781"], [[104, 116], "Unknown"], [[123, 132], "Q28"], [[454, 467], "Unknown"], [[497, 508], "Unknown"], [[515, 532], "Unknown"], [[591, 598], "Q28"], [[926, 933], "Unknown"], [[1028, 1039], "Unknown"], [[1044, 1058], "Q1781"], [[1071, 1092], "Unknown"], [[1130, 1137], "Q28"], [[1194, 1201], "Unknown"], [[1223, 1230], "Q28"], [[1233, 1239], "Q36"], [[1248, 1262], "Q213"], [[1327, 1334], "Q28"], [[1337, 1344], "Q28"], [[1524, 1531], "Unknown"], [[1639, 1646], "Unknown"], [[1685, 1693], "Q46"], [[1730, 1735], "Unknown"], [[1787, 1794], "Unknown"], [[1872, 1879], "Unknown"], [[1961, 1966], "Unknown"], [[1977, 1984], "Unknown"], [[2087, 2093], "Q46"], [[2156, 2163], "Unknown"], [[2207, 2214], "Unknown"], [[2265, 2272], "Unknown"], [[2315, 2320], "Q213"], [[2337, 2348], "Unknown"], [[2428, 2434], "Unknown"], [[2602, 2608], "Q36"], [[2732, 2740], "Q1781"]]}

Peter Smerdon NAIROBI 1996-08-27 The main rebel group in south Sudan said on Tuesday it was trying to arrange the release of six Roman Catholic missionaries , including three Australian nuns , held for nearly two weeks . George Garang , Nairobi spokesman for the Sudan People 's Liberation Army ( SPLA ) , said it was urgently trying to contact SPLA commander Nuour Marial at Mapourdit in the south to free the six . \" The movement is making arrangements for them to be set free . This is a decision of the leadership , \" Garang said . \" Commander Nuour Marial is a soldier so he must accept the leadership 's decision . But communications at this time of year are very difficult because of rains and a lack of power , \" he added . The Catholic Information Office in Nairobi said on Monday that four of the six had been charged by the SPLA with spying , spreading Islam and hindering recruitment into the rebel group . \" These charges are the interpretation of the church , \" Garang said on Tuesday . \" We have no idea why they are being held . We are still trying to establish contact with the local commander . \" Asked whether this meant the commander was out of control , Garang said the rebel movement was working on the problem . He said he believed all six were being held in the mission compound at Mapourdit and were reported to be in good health . The Catholic Information office in Nairobi said on Monday that Australian Sisters Moira Lynch , 73 , and Mary Batchelor , 68 , American Father Michael Barton , 48 , and Sudanese Father Raphael Riel , 48 , were held in a prison in south Sudan by the SPLA . It said Australian Sister Maureen Carey , 52 , and Italian Brother Raniero Iacomella , 28 , were held inside the compound . The church in Australia said on Monday Lynch , Batchelor , Barton and Riel were held in a prison until the weekend , when they were moved to join the other captives at the compound . The Catholic Information Office said the SPLA in the Kenyan capital had attributed the detentions of the six to a local commander and had promised they would be freed by August 23 . But the church learned in a recent meeting with the local commander that no instructions to release the prisoners were received and they would be held until investigations were completed . It said last Friday they were visited by Monsignor Caesar Mazzolari , apostolic administrator of the diocese of Rumbek in southern Sudan , and an SPLA administrator and appeared in good condition . \" On August 17 the mission was surrounded ( by the SPLA ) and sealed off . The evening of the same day the missionaries were put in prison or isolation . Later the mission was looted , \" it added . An Australian foreign ministry official said the charges against them were \" fairly bizarre \" and a matter for concern . He said Australian diplomats in Nairobi were working with the Roman Catholic church in southern Sudan and with U.S. and Italian diplomats in the region to help free the missionaries .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "OSCE postpones Bosnian municipal elections . SARAJEVO 1996-08-27 The U.S. diplomat in charge of elections in Bosnia announced on Tuesday that voting for municipal assemblies would be postponed because of irregularities by the Serbs in registering voters . Ambassador Robert Frowick , representing the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , told reporters that municipal polls due on September 14 with other Bosnian elections would be put off . \" I have made a chairman 's decision that it is not feasible to hold municipal elections on September 14 , \" said Frowick . He said no exact date had been set but it was possible the local elections would take place in the spring of 1997 . According to OSCE officials , Serb authorities have pressed their refugees to register to vote in towns now under Serb control , but which used to have Moslem majorities . Human rights workers say authorities in Serbia and Bosnian Serb territory have conducted a well-organised campaign to coerce refugees into registering only on Serb territory and failed to inform them of their rights under the Dayton peace agreement . Diplomats say the effect of the electoral engineering would be to establish political control over districts they conquered and ethnically cleansed in war . The response of the Bosnian Serbs to the OSCE 's announcement was not immediately clear . But Bosnian Serb leaders have hinted they would boycott the poll if the municipal elections were postponed , or go ahead with their own . The Bosnian Serb cabinet , in a letter to the OSCE , said on Monday that any delay of local elections would be \" a direct and flagrant violation fo the Dayton agreement \" . The Serbs , who administer half of Bosnia in a Serb republic , said they had met all conditions for holding the September elections . Diplomats fear that the crisis could cast doubt over the entire election process , which already appears set to confirm Bosnia 's ethnic partition rather than its reintegration as the Dayton peace agreement had planned .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 2043], "labels": [[[0, 4], "Unknown"], [[15, 22], "Q225"], [[45, 53], "Q11194"], [[69, 73], "Q30"], [[109, 115], "Q225"], [[226, 231], "Q403"], [[267, 281], "Unknown"], [[301, 352], "Unknown"], [[355, 359], "Unknown"], [[431, 438], "Q225"], [[582, 589], "Unknown"], [[721, 725], "Unknown"], [[738, 742], "Q403"], [[822, 826], "Q403"], [[860, 866], "Q432"], [[920, 926], "Q403"], [[931, 943], "Q11196"], [[1039, 1043], "Q403"], [[1106, 1112], "Q190315"], [[1308, 1321], "Unknown"], [[1329, 1333], "Unknown"], [[1382, 1394], "Q11196"], [[1520, 1532], "Q11196"], [[1562, 1566], "Unknown"], [[1668, 1674], "Q190315"], [[1693, 1698], "Q403"], [[1724, 1730], "Q225"], [[1736, 1740], "Q403"], [[1943, 1949], "Q225"], [[2007, 2013], "Q190315"]]}
{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "New talks in Chechnya as Lebed waits for Yeltsin . Dmitry Kuznets NOVYE ATAGI , Russia 1996-08-27 Russian and rebel military commanders finally met in Chechnya on Tuesday for delayed talks aimed at finalising a ceasefire arranged last week by President Boris Yeltsin 's envoy Alexander Lebed . The Russian army commander in the region , General Vyacheslav Tikhomirov , arrived at the rebel-held village of Novye Atagi , some 20 km ( 12 miles ) south of the Chechen capital Grozny for discussions with rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov . But Lebed himself , the Kremlin security chief , is still waiting back in Moscow to meet Yeltsin over his plans for a lasting political settlement in Chechnya . Itar-Tass news agency quoted the Kremlin press service as saying Yeltsin , who left for a state holiday home near Moscow on Monday , would hold no working meetings on Tuesday . Lebed interrupted talks with Chechnya 's separatists on a political deal on Sunday , saying he had to consult with Yeltsin . After a meeting failed to materialise on Monday , Lebed 's spokesman said he might meet the president on Tuesday . But Yeltsin 's spokesman rebuffed the suggestion , saying the president had left Moscow for a holiday near the capital . The Russians postponed the talks after a Chechen band disarmed a column of interior ministry troops on Sunday . The Chechens said a renegade group seized the weapons and said on Monday they had all been returned . The Russian command insisted that not all the weapons were the same as those taken . Tass said the weapons and the practical implementation of the ceasefire signed by Lebed and Maskhadov last Thursday would be on the agenda of today 's talks . Neither spoke to reporters before the meeting , which started around 10.45 a.m. ( 0645 GMT ) . Also in Novye Atagi on Tuesday morning , was Tim Guldimann , the Swiss diplomat who heads the Chechnya mission of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) . Guldimann , who helped broker an earlier truce in May , was not taking part in the Tikhomirov-Maskhadov talks . Lebed 's peace mission this month has stopped some of the worst fighting of the 20-month-old conflict . However , tension on the ground indicates that it could falter if the momentum for a settlement is not maintained . Three Russian servicemen were wounded in a total of six shooting incidents overnight , Itar-Tass news agency quoted the Russian military as saying on Tuesday morning . RIA news agency quoted an army source accusing rebel fighters of failing to turn up for joint Russian-Chechen police patrols in some districts of the capital Grozny on Tuesday . But the separatist command told Interfax news agency the patrols , part of the truce brokered by Lebed last week , would begin on Tuesday after delays for \" technical reasons \" . Yeltsin 's spokesman said he might meet officials during his break , but indicated Lebed was low on the list by saying Yeltsin would need time to study the proposals before talking to him . Russian news agencies also quoted the Kremlin spokesman as saying that Lebed 's representatives had not sought a meeting , hinting at an attempt by the president to put his popular and outspoken protege in his place with a lesson on protocol . Yeltsin , 65 , has kept a low profile since he was reelected in July , prompting new speculation that the two heart attacks he suffered last year and a rumoured drinking problem could be taking their toll , weakening his grip on affairs of state . Aides have dismissed such speculation , insisting that he simply needs a rest after his energetic election campaign . Some analysts say the Kremlin leader , whose order sending troops and tanks into Chechnya in 1994 started Russia 's ill-fated military campaign , could merely be reluctant to put his name to a peace process which might fall apart . But Lebed , who has no real power without his boss and has hinted at dark forces in Moscow working against him , appears to think a deal will not stick without strong backing from Yeltsin . His proposals have not been spelled out but are expected to involve a compromise between the separatists ' demand for independence and Moscow 's insistence that Chechnya remain part of the Russian Federation .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 4261], "labels": [[[13, 21], "Q5187"], [[25, 30], "Q295898"], [[41, 48], "Q34453"], [[51, 65], "Unknown"], [[66, 77], "Q3906456"], [[80, 86], "Q159"], [[98, 105], "Q159"], [[151, 159], "Q5187"], [[253, 266], "Q34453"], [[276, 291], "Q295898"], [[298, 305], "Q159"], [[345, 366], "Unknown"], [[406, 417], "Q3906456"], [[457, 464], "Q5187"], [[473, 479], "Q5196"], [[522, 537], "Q193354"], [[544, 549], "Q295898"], [[564, 571], "Q1140115"], [[614, 620], "Q649"], [[629, 636], "Q34453"], [[690, 698], "Q5187"], [[701, 710], "Q223799"], [[734, 741], "Q1140115"], [[766, 773], "Q34453"], [[815, 821], "Q649"], [[878, 883], "Q295898"], [[907, 915], "Q5187"], [[993, 1000], "Q34453"], [[1053, 1058], "Q295898"], [[1122, 1129], "Q34453"], [[1199, 1205], "Q649"], [[1243, 1251], "Q159"], [[1280, 1287], "Q5187"], [[1314, 1331], "Q6589202"], [[1355, 1363], "Q5187"], [[1457, 1464], "Q159"], [[1538, 1542], "Q127374"], [[1620, 1625], "Q295898"], [[1630, 1639], "Q193354"], [[1784, 1787], "Q30192"], [[1800, 1811], "Q3906456"], [[1837, 1850], "Unknown"], [[1857, 1862], "Q39"], [[1886, 1894], "Q5187"], [[1910, 1961], "Unknown"], [[1964, 1968], "Unknown"], [[1973, 1982], "Unknown"], [[2056, 2076], "Unknown"], [[2085, 2090], "Q295898"], [[2311, 2318], "Q159"], [[2392, 2401], "Q223799"], [[2425, 2432], "Q159"], [[2473, 2476], "Unknown"], [[2567, 2582], "Unknown"], [[2631, 2637], "Q5196"], [[2683, 2691], "Q379271"], [[2748, 2753], "Q295898"], [[2830, 2837], "Q34453"], [[2913, 2918], "Q295898"], [[2949, 2956], "Q34453"], [[3020, 3027], "Q159"], [[3058, 3065], "Q1140115"], [[3091, 3096], "Q295898"], [[3264, 3271], "Q34453"], [[3652, 3659], "Q133274"], [[3711, 3719], "Q5187"], [[3736, 3742], "Q159"], [[3866, 3871], "Q295898"], [[3946, 3952], "Q649"], [[4042, 4049], "Q34453"], [[4187, 4193], "Q649"], [[4213, 4221], "Q5187"], [[4241, 4259], "Q159"]]}

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "Nationalists want Iliescu ousted for Hungary pact . BUCHAREST 1996-08-27 Junior Nationalist members of Romania 's ruling coalition called on Tuesday for the impeachment of President Ion Iliescu for backing a friendship treaty with neighbouring Hungary . Iliescu 's Party of Social Democracy , the senior coalition partner , immediately dismissed the National Unity Party ( PUNR ) demand as crude electioneering . \" It is a desperate move by the PUNR , which is losing its only reason for existing ahead of the electoral campaign , \" said PDSR executive president Adrian Nastase . \" This treaty is both necessary and good , \" Nastase said , adding that the PUNR 's stance was threatening its position in the government . The treaty agreed unexpectedly two weeks ago will end years of disputes over the status of Romania 's large ethnic Hungarian minority . It will also boost both countries ' chances of admission to NATO and the European Union . \" If they ( the PUNR ) are so vexed , they could leave the government ... We might also help them to do it , if they go on like this , \" he said . The PUNR holds four key ministries -- justice , transport , agriculture and communications . PUNR leader Gheorghe Funar said in a statement Iliescu , in power since the fall of communism in 1989 , should be impeached for treason for compromising on the issue of ethnic Hungarian minority rights in the treaty due to be signed next month . Funar 's call came on the eve of the official launch of Iliescu 's campaign for a new term at November 3 polls . His appeal to the opposition to back his attempt to oust Iliescu was unlikely to succeed , analysts said . Iliescu has invited political leaders to a meeting on Thursday to discuss the final form of the pact which both Romanian and Hungarian nationalists oppose for different reasons .

Belinda Goldsmith TALLINN 1996-08-27 Estonia 's parliament failed for a second time to elect a president on Tuesday , dealing a blow to incumbent Lennart Meri and pushing the country towards stalemate in its choice of a new head of state . Neither Meri , who oversaw Estonia 's first steps into statehood after the collapse of the Soviet Union , nor his arch-rival , former communist Arnold Ruutel , have secured the 68 votes necessary from the 101-member parliament . Meri garnered 49 votes and Meri 34 in Tuesday 's ballot for the five-year presidency of Estonia .

If there is no result the decision will be ceded to an electoral college . \" The votes are a strong message to Meri that he is not favoured by some politicians any more , \" Reform Party head Heiki Kranich told Reuters . Under a constitution agreed in 1992 , a year after independence , the president has no executive powers . His only political role is to smoothe the functioning of government in periods of crisis . But Meri , 67 , has been accused in parliament of taking too much power and not always consulting parliamentarians before making decisions . His relations with a leftist-led government have sometimes been tense . His support in the first round of voting on Monday was much lower than expected , scoring only 45 votes , which political analysts put down as a vote of no confidence in his performance . This support only inched up to 49 in the second vote . Support for Ruutel , 68 , remained constant at 34 votes . If the third vote fails to give either Meri or Ruutel 68 votes , the parliamentary speaker will convene an electoral college of 101 MPs and 273 local goverment representatives to hold a new poll that could include new nominations . This would be the first time that the former Soviet republic has had to call together an electoral college .

SAO PAULO 1996-08-27 Brazil is likely to turn Sao Paulo state bank Banespa into a federal bank in a prior step to privatization , according to unnamed government sources , O Globo daily said . The newspaper said the Central Bank special administration of Banespa ends in December 30 and after that the bank has to be liquidated or turned into a federal bank since there are no conditions to return Banespa to Sao Paulo state government . A Central Bank spokesman said he could not confirm or deny the report . Banespa has been under central bank special temporary administration since December 1994 . The central bank management could be lifted if Sao Paulo state decided to take part in the recent federal government 's plan to restructure state banks . Under the plan , the federal government would provide 100 percent of the financing needed to restructure debt of state banks being privatized , liquidated or turned into development banks . It also offers to refinance up to 50 percent of the debt held by state banks whose governments decide to keep control of their banks . Although the plan was designed under terms proposed by Sao Paulo state governor Mario Covas , he has showed no interest in taking part in the plan because Sao Paulo 's debt with Banespa has increased sharply , O Globo said . Sao Paulo state 's debt is now estimated at 19 billion reais . O Globo also said another delicate case to be solved involves private bank Bamerindus . The newspaper said Bamerindus has sent to the Central Bank a proposal for restructuring combined with a request for a 90-day credit line , paying four percent a year plus the Basic Interest Rate of the Central Bank ( TBC ) .

That resulted in general elections in March 1973 when the Peronists led by Hector Campora and Vicente Solano Lima returned to power . Lanusse was a candidate in the election but failed to defeat his old adversories and never returned to public office . He was imprisoned for four years in 1951 for taking part in a coup attempt to overthrow Peron led by General Benjamin Menendez . Lanusse 's rule saw the gradual rise of left-wing activism which culminated in another period of brutal Argentine dictatorship from 1976 to 1983 , during which the military launched its \" dirty war \" that resulted in 10,000 missing people . In his autobiography published in 1990 , Lanusse described himself as a military man with \" democratic ideas . \" He was born in Buenos Aires in 1918 and married Ileana Bell with whom he had nine children .

Leon Barkho BAGHDAD 1996-08-27 A new U.N. relief coordinator has arrived in Baghdad to take up the task of organising humanitarian goods distribution and to face Iraq 's continuing opposition over the number of international monitors to be involved . U.N. and diplomatic sources said on Tuesday that Secretary- General Boutros Boutros-Ghali had appointed Italian Gualtiero Fulcheri and sent him to Iraq last week to replace Moroccan Mohamed Zejjari . One diplomat said Iraq and U.N. were still in disagreement on how many international observers would be required to ascertain the equitable distribution of humanitarian supplies that will be procured under Baghdad 's oil deal with U.N . \" The United Nations would like to employ hundreds of foreign monitors . Baghdad says it can only accept a few dozens , \" said the diplomat . Baghdad holds that the Iraq-U.N. memorandum of understanding on partial oil sales signed last June does not specify how many foreign observers should be stationed in Iraq . \" Observation of food supplies and their distribution are still a major issue and seems the two sides have not yet filled the gap separating them , \" said another diplomat . Iraq 's partial oil sales pact with U.N. , allowing crude exports worth $ 2 billion every six months , gives U.N. the right to supervise the purchase and distribution of food supplies in the country . The deal is a humanitarian exception to the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990 which include a ban on its oil exports . Fulcheri declined comment on the differences between the U.N. and Iraq , saying only : \" There are several different things which still need to be done . \" Fulcheri started his U.N. career in 1960 and has long experience in U.N. emergency relief in Congo , Angola , Sudan and Somalia .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 1853], "labels": [[[4, 8], "Q1065"], [[39, 43], "Q796"], [[46, 57], "Unknown"], [[58, 65], "Q1530"], [[83, 87], "Q1065"], [[122, 129], "Q1530"], [[208, 212], "Q796"], [[297, 301], "Q1065"], [[365, 386], "Q1257"], [[401, 408], "Q38"], [[409, 427], "Unknown"], [[444, 448], "Q796"], [[470, 478], "Q1028"], [[479, 494], "Unknown"], [[515, 519], "Q796"], [[524, 528], "Q1065"], [[703, 710], "Q1530"], [[740, 754], "Q1065"], [[807, 814], "Q1530"], [[876, 883], "Q1530"], [[899, 908], "Unknown"], [[1042, 1046], "Q796"], [[1223, 1227], "Q796"], [[1259, 1263], "Q1065"], [[1332, 1336], "Q1065"], [[1468, 1472], "Q1065"], [[1494, 1498], "Q796"], [[1512, 1518], "Q817"], [[1568, 1576], "Unknown"], [[1625, 1629], "Q1065"], [[1634, 1638], "Q796"], [[1724, 1732], "Unknown"], [[1745, 1749], "Q1065"], [[1792, 1796], "Q1065"], [[1817, 1822], "Q971"], [[1825, 1831], "Q916"], [[1834, 1839], "Q1049"], [[1844, 1851], "Q1045"]]}

He told Reuters the reason was his own front-page editorial , entitled \" A Chronic Mental Illness \" in which he attacks compliant Arab leaders for serving U.S. and Israeli interests . \" The Arabs demand that our Arab leaders undergo a compulsory examination by a team of psychiatrists to see how sound their mental capacities are , \" the editorial said . \" Because our leaders have started to behave with extreme hostility towards the interests of their peoples to court the goodwill of the Americans and the Zionists , \" he added . The censorship office denied they had confiscated the newspapers but declined to say when they could go on sale .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 1080], "labels": [[[0, 5], "Q79"], [[53, 58], "Q85"], [[70, 75], "Q79"], [[124, 136], "Unknown"], [[137, 143], "Q35323"], [[162, 172], "Unknown"], [[232, 236], "Q35323"], [[285, 303], "Unknown"], [[311, 331], "Unknown"], [[406, 412], "Q229"], [[442, 449], "Q130879"], [[564, 568], "Q35323"], [[589, 593], "Q30"], [[598, 605], "Q801"], [[624, 629], "Q35323"], [[646, 650], "Q35323"], [[925, 934], "Q30"], [[943, 951], "Q42388"]]}

India blocked the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva , saying the pact did not contain a clause committing the five declared nuclear powers to a timetable for nuclear disarmament . New Delhi 's stance , which was seen as effectively thwarting 2-1/2 years of negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament , drew widespread but generally muted foreign criticism . India has also pledged to oppose any forwarding of the draft treaty to the United Nations General Assembly . China said many countries had compromised to complete the treaty and that the issue of a disarmament schedule could be discussed in future negotiations . \" The completion of the test ban treaty would be an important and practical step in the gradual process of achieving total nuclear disarmament , \" it said . China has pledged support for the pact since reaching a deal with the United States that made international inspections of nuclear sites more difficult than in earlier drafts of the accord . The newspaper said China advocated the complete ban and destruction of nuclear weapons but that there was little hope other nuclear powers would soon adopt the same stance . \" Some nuclear powers stubbornly uphold policies of nuclear deterrence based on first use of nuclear weapons , \" it said . China held on July 29 what it said would be its last nuclear test before a self-imposed moratorium that took effect the following day .

TOKYO 1996-08-27 The government said on Tuesday that the threat from a mysterious killer germ , while still requiring vigilance , appears to be receding in the western Japan city of Sakai , where the epidemic hit the hardest . The food poisoning epidemic caused by the O-157 colon bacillus in Sakai appears to be \" settling down \" , Health Minister Naoto Kan was quoted by a government spokesman as telling the cabinet . The O-157 colon bacillus has been found responsible for a widespread food poisoning epidemic that has killed 11 people and made over 9,500 ill this year . Sakai , near the regional commercial centre of Osaka , has been hit hardest by the deadly bacteria , with nearly 6,500 , mostly schoolchildren , affected by the disease . Two children in Sakai have died from complications associated with the bacteria . Kan told a cabinet meeting on Tuesday that no new victims have been reported since August 8 , indicating that the peak has passed , at least for Sakai . Sakai officials agreed with the assessment , but said it was too early to feel relieved . \" There are still patients hospitalised and problems which must be dealt with , \" a city spokesman said , citing the issue of whether to allow children infected with the bacteria but not showing symptoms to attend school from September . Health authorities believe school lunches were the source of the food poisoning in Sakai , but researchers have been unable to pinpoint the exact source of the infection . The outbreak has prompted authorities to tighten sanitary standards at slaughterhouses and meatpacking plants and sparked calls for an overhaul of the nation 's school lunch programme . The ministers agreed at Tuesday 's cabinet meeting to step up inspection measures for school lunches in September and October , when schools around the country resume . Japan 's Agriculture Ministry also announced that it will compile hygiene guidelines based on U.S. government methods of checking the safety of farm produce to prevent another outbreak of the epidemic .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "SEC adopts rules to improve investor access to best stock prices . WASHINGTON 1996-08-28 The Securities and Exchange Commission Wednesday approved rules designed to give stock market investors a better chance at getting the best price available for their orders . The so-called order handling rules , which were proposed last September , were approved in a 4-0 vote . The new rules will require specialists at stock exchanges and market makers on Nasdaq to allow customers to view price quotes from other electronic trading systems that may not be readily available to them . The rules will also require that customer limit orders be displayed with prices better than those available in quotes publicly available at the time . Specialists and market makers are companies or individuals recognised as qualified to maintain an orderly market in a stock . In a limit order , investors specify the price at which they are willing to buy or sell , as opposed to a market order executed at prevailing prices . \" These rules are intended to empower all investors , by allowing their orders to compete on a level playing field , and by providing the disclosure they need to make informed decisions , \" said SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt . The SEC 's goal , he added , was to create \" one system where one price could be available to everybody . \" The director of the SEC 's division of market regulation , Richard Lindsey , said Wall Street firms will probably need to spend about $ 7 million to carry out the improvements called for by the new rules . In proposing the rules last year , the SEC noted that while technology has improved , commonplace practices still existed that worked against investors ' best interests . It noted that customers whose orders were not displayed lost the chance of getting the best possible price available in the market . It also cited the potential problem of a two-tiered market in which market makers quote one price to public investors while quoting better prices in private systems , thus robbing investors without access to \" hidden \" quotes the benefit of the best available prices . Earlier this month , the SEC settled charges of alleged malpractices on Nasdaq when the parent of the Nasdaq market , the National Association of Securities Dealers , agreed to spend $ 100 million over five years to upgrade its oversight of brokers ' trading practices . The SEC dropped a third proposal that would have allowed investors with market orders to trade at a better price if there were shifts in prices before their orders were executed . The agency said it would monitor effects of the two new rules before considering the \" price improvement \" proposal again . The agency also proposed rule changes that would require continuous \" bid \" and \" ask \" quotations from exchange specialists and market makers who trade more than 1 percent of a stock during any quarter on Nasdaq . The SEC 's limit order display rule will mean a major change for Nasdaq , where such orders have never been displayed . The president of the Nasdaq , Alfred Berkeley , was to hold a news conference Wednesday afternoon to elaborate on the new rules ' effects on the market , the second largest in the world .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 3212], "labels": [[[0, 3], "Unknown"], [[67, 77], "Q61"], [[93, 127], "Unknown"], [[447, 453], "Q82059"], [[1199, 1202], "Unknown"], [[1212, 1225], "Q4799509"], [[1232, 1235], "Unknown"], [[1356, 1359], "Unknown"], [[1395, 1410], "Unknown"], [[1418, 1429], "Q11690"], [[1581, 1584], "Unknown"], [[2140, 2143], "Unknown"], [[2187, 2193], "Q82059"], [[2217, 2223], "Q82059"], [[2237, 2279], "Unknown"], [[2390, 2393], "Unknown"], [[2896, 2902], "Q82059"], [[2909, 2912], "Unknown"], [[2970, 2976], "Q82059"], [[3046, 3052], "Q82059"], [[3055, 3070], "Q4722318"]]}

When controversy forced the draw to be done over -- against odds of 151-to-1 -- Medvedev and Fleurian drew each other a second time . \" When I saw the new draw I did n't have to change my preparation , \" Medvedev said . \" I think it 's destined that it turned out for me . \"", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 2840], "labels": [[[17, 25], "Q355338"], [[48, 60], "Unknown"], [[61, 69], "Q60"], [[91, 106], "Q355338"], [[338, 346], "Q355338"], [[366, 375], "Q142"], [[376, 398], "Q964112"], [[439, 448], "Q123577"], [[458, 466], "Q355338"], [[557, 567], "Q203273"], [[715, 723], "Q355338"], [[903, 911], "Q355338"], [[1183, 1191], "Q355338"], [[1230, 1234], "Unknown"], [[1591, 1599], "Q355338"], [[1672, 1683], "Q43605"], [[1730, 1738], "Q355338"], [[1823, 1832], "Q212"], [[1939, 1947], "Q355338"], [[2083, 2091], "Q355338"], [[2098, 2108], "Q408"], [[2115, 2124], "Q2907592"], [[2258, 2266], "Q355338"], [[2282, 2293], "Q203273"], [[2354, 2362], "Q355338"], [[2386, 2394], "Q964112"], [[2510, 2518], "Q355338"], [[2523, 2531], "Q964112"], [[2646, 2654], "Q355338"], [[2659, 2667], "Q964112"], [[2770, 2778], "Q355338"]]}

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "TENNIS - GRAF WORKS HARD FOR FIRST-ROUND WIN . Bill Berkrot NEW YORK 1996-08-27 It was n't supposed to be this hard for defending champion Steffi Graf to win her opening match at the U.S. Open on Tuesday night . But the script that called for the usual first-round demolition by the top-ranked top seed was rewritten by 29th-ranked Indonesian Yayuk Basuki playing with nothing to lose abandon . Graf , of course , prevailed 6-3 7-6 , but not before some tense moments that even had the German superstar thinking the match was going three sets . \" I won the second set , which I did n't think I would do , being down 5-2 and the chances she had at 6-5 , \" Graf recalled . Several of the other women 's seeds eased into the second round with more typical Graf-like efficiency Tuesday . As afternoon turned to evening , fourth-seeded Spaniard Conchita Martinez took apart Romanian Ruxandra Dragomir in 58 minutes with the loss of just two games , one more than second seed Monica Seles , who opened the second-day programme by crushing American Anne Miller 6-0 6-1 . Third seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario , the 1994 champion , and eighth-seeded Olympic gold medalist Lindsay Davenport dropped three game each en route to the second round . But the day was not without its seeded casualties on the women 's side . Fifth-seed Iva Majoli of Croatia was picked off by Austrian Judith Wiesner and Wimbledon semifinalist Kimiko Date of Japan , the 10th seed , fell 6-2 7-5 to 53rd-ranked American Kimberly Po . Date 's defeat left no other seeded players in Seles 's quarter of the draw , which lost Anke Huber ( 6 ) and Maggie Maleeva ( 12 ) on Monday . But Graf , winner of 20 Grand Slam titles , was not about to join that list . \" At some points I felt a little nervous , \" she admitted . \" When it came down to the important points , I felt more confident . \" Basuki , a first-round loser here for the fifth consecutive year , was clearly going for winners , hitting the lines and running Graf around the court as she broke the top seed twice in the second set to grab that shocking 5-2 lead .

PARIS 1996-08-28 Euro 96 star Vladimir Smicer of the Czech Republic scored at the last second for Lens , allowing them to retain the lead in the French soccer league on Wednesday . Smicer pushed the ball home in injury time to lead his team to a 3-2 victory over Montpellier , who were leading 2-1 until Cameroon 's Marc-Vivien Foe equalised on a header in the 85th minute . The win was the fourth in as many matches this season for Lens , who lead the table on 12 points . In-form Paris St Germain , who dismissed Nantes 1-0 , are second with 10 points . Along with Smicer , Robert Pires was the star of the night in France , scoring the first hat-trick of the league season in Metz 's 3-1 home victory over neighbouring Strasbourg . Pires , one of the most promising strikers in the country , was called up for the first time this week by French manager Aime Jacquet for a friendly against Mexico on Saturday at the Parc des Princes . Pires scored first with a powerful shot in the 35th minute before striking again from close range just before the break . A solitary raid allowed him to score his third in the 74th . Smicer 's goal was as hard-won as his team 's victory . Spurred by Foe 's leveller five minutes before , Lens pressed hard and Foe hit the crossbar in the dying seconds on another header . The ball bounced back to Smicer 's feet and he scored . Montpellier seized an unexpected lead thanks to Kader Ferhaoui in the fourth minute after a blunder from Lens goalkeeper Jean-Claude Nadon . The side from northern France , forced to fight an uphill battle from then on , pulled level thanks to Tony Vairelles in the eighth minute but young striker Fabien Lefevre made it two for Montpellier five minutes later . League favourites PSG scored a convincing 1-0 win over Nantes and confirmed they would again be the team to beat this season . Ironically , PSG 's victory owed a lot to two former Nantes players , striker Patrice Loko , who scored on a brilliant shot in the 33rd minute , and defender Benoit Cauet , who started the one-two which allowed Loko to score . The Parisians , who have yet to concede a goal , were without Brazil 's Leonardo and Panama 's Julio Cesar Dely Valdes , both called up by their national sides . For Nantes , who shocked PSG to win the league crown two years ago , the fall is very painful . The Canaries , who lost most of their key players within two years , have yet to win a match this season . Reigning champions Auxerre had to settle for a goalless draw against Marseille on Tuesday .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 2596], "labels": [[[9, 15], "Q311342"], [[40, 44], "Q191843"], [[59, 64], "Q90"], [[76, 83], "Q180563"], [[89, 104], "Q311342"], [[112, 126], "Q213"], [[157, 161], "Q191843"], [[204, 210], "Q142"], [[240, 246], "Q311342"], [[322, 333], "Q19513"], [[363, 371], "Q1009"], [[375, 390], "Q223843"], [[492, 496], "Q191843"], [[541, 557], "Q483020"], [[574, 580], "Q192071"], [[626, 632], "Q311342"], [[635, 647], "Q113156"], [[677, 683], "Q142"], [[738, 742], "Q221525"], [[781, 791], "Q126334"], [[794, 799], "Q113156"], [[900, 906], "Q47774"], [[915, 927], "Q311027"], [[951, 957], "Q164089"], [[977, 993], "Q193431"], [[996, 1001], "Q113156"], [[1179, 1185], "Q311342"], [[1246, 1249], "Unknown"], [[1284, 1288], "Q191843"], [[1306, 1309], "Unknown"], [[1393, 1399], "Q311342"], [[1424, 1435], "Q19513"], [[1472, 1486], "Q307940"], [[1529, 1533], "Q191843"], [[1545, 1562], "Unknown"], [[1588, 1594], "Q142"], [[1668, 1682], "Q1367655"], [[1722, 1736], "Unknown"], [[1753, 1764], "Q19513"], [[1804, 1807], "Q483020"], [[1841, 1847], "Q192071"], [[1926, 1929], "Q483020"], [[1966, 1972], "Q192071"], [[1991, 2003], "Q469243"], [[2071, 2083], "Q818107"], [[2124, 2128], "Q469243"], [[2144, 2153], "Unknown"], [[2202, 2208], "Q155"], [[2212, 2220], "Unknown"], [[2225, 2231], "Q804"], [[2235, 2258], "Q553353"], [[2306, 2312], "Q192071"], [[2327, 2330], "Q483020"], [[2398, 2410], "Unknown"], [[2524, 2531], "Q182876"], [[2574, 2583], "Q132885"]]}

Adrian Warner BONN 1996-08-28 Organisers hope to persuade Britain 's former Olympic 100 metres champion Linford Christie to join a \" Dream Team \" sprint relay in a special tribute to Jesse Owens at Friday 's Berlin grand prix . Christie , who is retiring from international competition at the end of the season , was not due to compete in the German capital but Berlin promoter Rudi Thiel said : \" We are still hopeful of getting him to come . \" Thiel has managed to get most of the Olympic 100 metres champions since 1948 to attend the meeting , which is being held in the stadium where Owens won four gold medals 60 years ago at the Berlin Olympics . Canada 's Donovan Bailey , the Olympic 100 metres champion and world record holder , and Namibian Frankie Fredericks , the silver medallist at the recent Atlanta Games , have already agreed to run in the 4X100 metres team . Thiel said on Wednesday that he had also asked Olympic 200 and 400 champion Michael Johnson to run as well as Christie . \" Most of the Olympic champions of the past are coming including Britain 's ( 1980 champion ) Allan Wells . Christie belongs to them . It would be great to have him here . \" There is a good offer .... My minimum would be that he just ran the relay , \" he said . The 36-year-old Briton is still considering the offer and is expected to announce his decision later on Wednesday .

Jayasuriya , whose first 50 included three sixes and three fours , went on to an unbeaten 120 and the man-of-the-match award . Kaluwitharana , slow in comparison , was bowled by Tendulkar for 53 , but Aravinda de Silva with 49 not out helped see Sri Lanka home . Earlier , Tendulkar completed his ninth century in one-day cricket , taking 138 balls to do it before being run out . The rest of the Indian batting was generally tied down by brilliant fielding and some fairly tight bowling , although ex-captain Mohamed Azharuddin chipped in with 58 , adding 129 with Tendulkar off 28 overs , before being stumped .

Some Moslem refugees among the 385 registered voters Hungary 's largest camp Nagyatad have written to the OSCE complaining that they were unable to vote in contests for the president or assembly of the Bosnian-Croat Federation , where most Moslems live . This was because their pre-war homes are now in the Serb-controlled territory , so they were voting for the national assembly of the Republika Srbska , most of the candidates for which are Serbs . For the foreign powers which back last year 's Dayton peace agreement , the main point of the election rules is that by voting as though they were still in their pre-war homes , Bosnians should override the effects of ethnic cleansing and reassert the concept of a single multi-ethnic state .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "Dole blasts Clinton for ignoring teen drug use . Judith Crosson VENTURA , Calif. 1996-08-28 Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole Wednesday accused the Clinton administration of ignoring drug use among teenagers and said if elected he would use the National Guard to stop drugs from entering the United States . \" He 'll probably mention his war on drugs , which he 's going to start like everything else -- next year . It 's too late , Mr. President , \" Dole told an outdoor crowd of several hundred at a private religious school . He also commented briefly on published reports that the administration was planning to announce a plan to lower capital gains taxes for home sales . \" Welcome to the club . We 've had it out there for weeks and weeks and weeks , \" Dole said . Dole said former first lady Nancy Reagan was laughed at with her \" just say no \" anti-drug message . \" But it worked , \" Dole said . Meanwhile , in Los Angeles , Dole 's running mate , Jack Kemp , campaigned aggressively for the black vote in an area that was the flashpoint of the 1992 Los Angeles riots . Kemp told a crowd of about 300 African Americans in south central Los Angeles , \" Keep your eyes open , keep your ears open , keep your heart open . I want to tell you with all my heart that we want to win your vote . \" In Dole 's address to a group that was largely white , the presidential nominee likened the stream of illegal drugs into the United States to missiles aimed at American children and promised to appoint federal judges who would be tough on illegal drug use . \" They 're aiming millions and millions of missiles right at these young people , whether it 's a needle , whether it 's a cigarette , whatever the delivery system is -- it 's poison and it 's got to stop in America . \" he said . Dole said 70 percent of the cocaine that entered the United States and 40 percent of the marijuana came from Mexico . \" We 've got an international problem and I 'm prepared to use our military might . We want to stop drugs at the border , \" he said . Dole 's remarks prompted questions about whether he was seeking a ban on cigarettes . \" I did n't say anything about cigarettes . I was talking about drugs . I said you should n't smoke either . That 's all I said , \" he replied as he was shaking hands with well-wishers . When asked specifically if he was suggesting a ban on cigarettes , Dole replied : \" Oh no . Come on , you know better than that . \" Dole campaign aides said the candidate was telling young people not to smoke . Dole also said he opposed California Proposition 215 which , if approved by voters , would allow the cultivation of marijuana plants for medicinal uses . Dole said the initiative would allow marijuana to be used for anything from a headache to an ingrown toenail . In an effort to paint the drug issue in non-political terms , Dole said three times during his 20-minute address that illegal drug use was neither a Democratic nor a Republican issue but one that involves all people . The anti-drug message is a theme Dole feels has strong voter appeal . On Sunday near Chicago he accused President Bill Clinton of \" raising the white flag \" in the war on drugs . A recent survey showed that illegal drug use among 12-17 year-olds had doubled in the past four years . Dole was flanked by several California Republican politicians including Gov . Pete Wilson , who said local and state governments cannot fight illegal drugs alone . \" We need all the help we can get . We need to get the kind of help we used to get when Ronald Reagan and George Bush were in the White House , \" Wilson said .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 3621], "labels": [[[0, 4], "Q319079"], [[12, 19], "Q1124"], [[49, 63], "Unknown"], [[64, 71], "Q490434"], [[74, 80], "Q99"], [[92, 102], "Q29468"], [[126, 134], "Q319079"], [[157, 164], "Q1124"], [[254, 268], "Q928670"], [[301, 314], "Q30"], [[460, 464], "Q319079"], [[769, 773], "Q319079"], [[781, 785], "Q319079"], [[809, 821], "Q193426"], [[902, 906], "Q319079"], [[929, 940], "Q65"], [[943, 947], "Q319079"], [[966, 975], "Q357676"], [[1068, 1079], "Q65"], [[1088, 1092], "Q357676"], [[1119, 1136], "Q49085"], [[1154, 1165], "Q65"], [[1311, 1315], "Q319079"], [[1433, 1446], "Q30"], [[1468, 1476], "Q30"], [[1774, 1781], "Q30"], [[1796, 1800], "Q319079"], [[1849, 1862], "Q30"], [[1905, 1911], "Q96"], [[2048, 2052], "Q319079"], [[2388, 2392], "Q319079"], [[2453, 2457], "Q319079"], [[2532, 2536], "Q319079"], [[2558, 2584], "Unknown"], [[2686, 2690], "Q319079"], [[2859, 2863], "Q319079"], [[2946, 2956], "Q29552"], [[2963, 2973], "Q29468"], [[3048, 3052], "Q319079"], [[3100, 3107], "Q1297"], [[3129, 3141], "Q1124"], [[3298, 3302], "Q319079"], [[3326, 3336], "Q99"], [[3337, 3347], "Q29468"], [[3376, 3387], "Q714909"], [[3550, 3563], "Q9960"], [[3568, 3579], "Q23505"], [[3592, 3603], "Q35525"], [[3608, 3614], "Q714909"]]}

Greg Frost KANSAS CITY , Mo . 1996-08-28 Above-normal summer rainfall in the U.S. High Plains has produced near-ideal conditions for planting the 1997 hard red winter wheat crop , analysts said Wednesday . From central Texas north to Kansas , rains throughout July and August have relieved most of the drought conditions that plagued the region earlier this year . \" Our moisture situation is excellent , especially for fall planting of winter wheat , \" said Kim Anderson , extension wheat marketing economist at Oklahoma State University . The irony of the above-average summer rainfall was not lost on High Plains wheat producers , who only three months ago were caught in a drought so severe that old-timers likened conditions to the \" Dust Bowl \" days of the 1930s . \" It 's definitely a turnabout from this past year , but you know last year we had pretty good moisture about this time of year , and then about October 1 it quit , \" said Mark Hodges , executive director of the Oklahoma Wheat Commission . \" Hopefully that 's not going to happen this year . \" According to figures released by the Oklahoma Climatological Survey , an average of 20.19 inches fell across the state between March 1 and August 26 , 1996 . That 's about 1/2 inch above the average for the same time period , according to Howard Johnson , associate state climatologist at the University of Oklahoma . He noted that the majority of that 20.19 inches had fallen since July . As an example of just how dry it was , data showed that between October 1 , 1995 and March 1 , 1996 , the state received an average of only 4.6 inches of rainfall . In northern Texas , the current rainfall situation was similar to most of Oklahoma , said Rodney Mosier , executive assistant for the Texas Wheat Producers . \" Up here in the Texas Panhandle , we 've had some extremely beneficial rains that came through within the last several days and are really setting us up for ideal conditions for planting wheat , \" Mosier said . But he warned that the situation was not as ideal in central and southern Texas , where mositure levels were still short despite the rains brought by Hurricane Dolly last week . In Kansas , typically the number one U.S. hard red winter wheat producer , topsoil moisture levels were rated mostly adequate during the week ended Sunday , according to the state 's agricultural statistics service .

Evelyn Leopold UNITED NATIONS 1996-08-28 Burundi 's ambassador on Wednesday lashed out at economic sanctions imposed by African states and said any thought of an arms embargo would be a windfall for guerrillas fighting his army-run government . In a lengthy debate on Burundi before the U.N. Security Council , Ambassador Nsanze Terence said the new military government took over to stabilise the country and wanted negotiations under former Tanzanian President Julius Nyrere . Nearly every African member who spoke , as well as most Security Council members , however , were unsympathetic towards the government of President Pierre Buyoya , an army major put in power in a July coup by the Tutsi-run military , which is locked in a guerrilla war with the majority Hutus . \" These ( African ) brothers should have been the first to bind the wounds of Burundi , \" Terence said of the economic embargo . \" Quite the contrary , Burundi has seen economic war declared against it by fellow African people ... a gratuitous immolation of the people of Burundi . \" He said his government had just asked U.N. human rights monitors to increase their numbers in Burundi in an effort \" to put an end to this vicious circle of violence . \" More than 150,000 people have been killed in violence between the minority Tutsis and the majority Hutus since 1993 . Botswana 's envoy , Mothusi Nkgowe , said coups should be relegated \" to the dump heap of history \" as there could be no justification for the overthrow of a legitimate government . Chile has proposed a resolution , still under discussion , that would impose an immediate arms embargo on Burundi and call for negotiations . The draft suggests further sanctions against those who impede a political solution . Among the council 's five permanent members , Russia and the United States appeared to support most elements of the Chilean proposal , while Britain , France and China were cautious . Terence , a Tutsi , said any arms embargo would leave the army unable to defend itself against Hutu guerrillas and leave the population exposed to \" armed terroritsts . \" But Chilean Ambassador Juan Somavia said : \" Every weapon that reached Burundi is a weapon aimed mainly at killing an unarmed civilian . We must not send a signal different from the African leaders themselves . Inaction is becoming the worst possible course of action . \" Burundi 's parliament has been suspended and political parties are banned but Terence told reporters Buyoya would reconvene a new type of national assembly in October . The United States said the coup leaders had taken no steps to restore democracy and indiscriminate killings continued . Ambassador Karl Inderfurth said the new government should have \" unconditional \" negotiations with all parties inside and outside of the country . He said Washington strongly supported the economic sanctions imposed already and if these did not work the council would consider \" an arms embargo or targeted sanctions against faction leaders . \" But he said the international community had to be prepared for the worst and avoid a replay of the horrors in neighbouring Rwanda , where widespread genocide broke out against the Tutsis two years ago .

LTTE spokesmen could not immediately be reached for comment , but Sri Lankan fishermen denied that Indians were being coerced into carrying refugees across the Palk Strait . \" Indian fishermen come right up to Pesalai to fish , and when refugees request them to ferry them across , they readily oblige . Only some take money , \" Sri Lankan boatman Chinnathambi said . Arulanandam denied the fishermen charged the refugees for passage to India and said it was unfair to penalise them for the refugees ' arrival . \" We have not gone to sea since August 19 , but refugees are arriving daily nevertheless . How could we alone be held responsible for the influx ? \" he said . An Indian Fisheries Department official said the government planned to urge fishermen not to cross the international boundary between India and Sri Lanka , but admitted this would be hard to enforce because of Sri Lanka 's pomfret-rich waters .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 2798], "labels": [[[0, 5], "Q668"], [[36, 41], "Unknown"], [[53, 72], "Unknown"], [[73, 83], "Q1435144"], [[86, 91], "Q668"], [[103, 109], "Q668"], [[215, 224], "Q854"], [[228, 233], "Q668"], [[360, 364], "Q80312"], [[367, 399], "Q80312"], [[503, 517], "Unknown"], [[581, 591], "Q1435144"], [[608, 614], "Q668"], [[624, 634], "Q1445"], [[656, 670], "Unknown"], [[701, 711], "Q1435144"], [[751, 760], "Q854"], [[784, 798], "Q470875"], [[876, 881], "Unknown"], [[921, 928], "Q35381"], [[1055, 1065], "Q1445"], [[1111, 1117], "Q173491"], [[1155, 1164], "Q854"], [[1179, 1184], "Q668"], [[1191, 1197], "Q668"], [[1465, 1470], "Unknown"], [[1482, 1510], "Unknown"], [[1521, 1530], "Unknown"], [[1724, 1734], "Q854"], [[1871, 1875], "Unknown"], [[1883, 1887], "Q80312"], [[1949, 1959], "Q854"], [[1982, 1989], "Q668"], [[2043, 2054], "Q186299"], [[2059, 2065], "Q668"], [[2093, 2100], "Q7171323"], [[2212, 2222], "Q854"], [[2231, 2243], "Unknown"], [[2251, 2262], "Unknown"], [[2320, 2325], "Q668"], [[2557, 2584], "Unknown"], [[2688, 2693], "Q668"], [[2698, 2707], "Q854"], [[2764, 2773], "Q854"]]}

Peter Griffiths LONDON 1996-08-28 A firm start on Wall Street helped push leading London shares to a new record high on Wednesday and German stocks closed floor trading up but the Paris bourse slipped sharply , hit by a weakening franc and fears of industrial unrest . On the foreign exchange markets , a survey indicating weaker than expected Japanese business sentiment boosted the dollar in early trading but it failed to build on its gains against the yen and slipped lower against the mark in quiet afternoon trade . London shares , boosted by Wall Street , added to early gains with the blue chip FTSE 100 index hitting a new peak of 3921.8 before dropping back slightly . One focus was British Airways , which rebounded after fears faded that the cancellation of \" open skies \" talks between the U.S. Transportation Department and the British government may jeopardise its tie-up with American Airlines . The conclusion of an open skies agreement had been made a prerequisite of the proposed link-up by the U.S . Better-than-expected British trade figures had little impact on equities . The non-EU July trade deficit totalled 506 million sterling ( $ 788 million ) while June 's world deficit was 1.12 billion pounds . Forecasts were for deficits of 900 million sterling and 1.4 billion sterling . German shares shed some gains on profit-taking but nonetheless ended the floor session higher buoyed by demand for chemical stocks and a stable dollar . The 30-share DAX index closed at 2,563.16 points , up 4.32 . However , French stocks extended opening losses to more than one percent in morning trading , falling through the 2000 point resistance level on the main CAC-40 index . Dealers blamed a weakening franc and worries about the 1997 budget and possible autumn strikes Louis Viannet , leader of France 's Communist-led CGT union , criticised government plans for spending cuts in the 1997 budget on Wednesday and warned of labour unrest as France gets back to work after the holidays . Later in the day , helped by the firmer Wall Street opening , Paris climbed back to the 2000 level but still remained well into negative territory . In foreign exchange the dollar was trading at around 108.40 yen in the European afternoon , up from its European close on Tuesday of 107.55 but off the day 's highs . It had been boosted overnight by the Bank of Japan 's quarterly corporate survey , or \" tankan \" , of major manufacturers -- an important gauge of business sentiment . The unexpectedly weak figures convinced markets that Japanese interest rates would stay at rock-bottom levels -- weakening the yen . The Japanese discount rate is currently at a record low of 0.5 percent . The BOJ sought to put the best face on the data which defied economists ' predictions of improving sentiment and was the first decline in business sentiment in a year . A BOJ spokesman said \" the doors to the recovery have not been shut ... the recovery is still continuing . \" These remarks gave the yen some backbone and the dollar failed to progress further . \" The dollar 's gains were less than spectacular , suggesting that while it 's likely to benefit from revised Japanese rate expectations , a breakout from the established trading range does n't appear likely , \" said currency economist Klaus Baader . Dealers said shares were also affected by a slippage in bond prices due to lower than expected June industrial production , showing the economy was still faltering . CURRENCIES AT 1500 GMT The dollar was at 108.40 yen and 1.4765 marks compared with Tuesday 's European close of 107.78 yen and 1.4779 marks STOCK MARKETS AT 1500 GMT The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares had risen 15 points to 3,920.7 .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "Arafat says Israel declares war on Palestinians . Wafa Amr RAMALLAH , West Bank 1996-08-28 Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said on Wednesday that Israel had declared war on the Palestinians and called for the first general strike in the West Bank and Gaza in two years . \" What happened concerning continuous violations and crimes from this new Israeli leadership means they are declaring a state of war against the Palestinian people , \" Arafat told the Palestinian legislature . Accusing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of stupidity , Arafat launched his strongest attack on the right-wing government since its election in May . The tirade was sparked by Israel 's announcement on Tuesday of plans to expand the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Sefer and its demolishing of a community centre in Arab East Jerusalem . \" Israel has started the war on Jerusalem . They are idiots to have started the Jerusalem battle , \" Arafat said in Arabic . \" There will be no Palestinian state without Jerusalem . Netanyahu should know he is stupid to have started this battle . \" Arafat called for a general strike \" for Jerusalem \" on Thursday in all of the West Bank and Gaza Strip . There has not been a joint shutdown there since May 1994 when Israeli troops began withdrawing under an interim self-rule agreement signed in 1993 . The strike will have little effect on the Israeli economy while hurting Palestinian merchants in East Jerusalem and Bethlehem who cater to the tourist trade . Some 25,000 Palestinian labourers are likely to stay away from their jobs , mainly in construction , in Israel . But Palestinians , once the backbone of the building industry , have been largely replaced by labourers from Romania and China . \" On Friday , all Moslems , including Palestinians in Israel ... will go to ( Jerusalem 's ) Al-Aqsa mosque and pray . Jews and Christians who do not pray should accompany them and stand behind them , \" Arafat said . Officials in Netanyahu 's office were not immediately available for comment on Arafat 's remarks . Israeli travel restrictions , imposed after bombings by Moslem militants in February and March , ban most of the two million Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza from entering Jerusalem . Netanyahu , who opposes trading occupied land for peace , made Jerusalem a central issue in his election campaign , accusing Labour Prime Minister Shimon Peres of planning to hand control of the Arab eastern part of the city to the Palestinians . Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and claims both halves of the city as its capital . The PLO wants East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state . In his speech to the crowded legislature , Arafat signalled he was not abandoning diplomacy although \" alarm bells are ringing \" . He unexpectedly broke off his address to take a telephone call from U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross , who held talks in Paris on Tuesday with Israeli and Egyptian officials . When Arafat returned to the podium , he said senior PLO negotiator Mahmoud Abbas , better known as Abu Mazen , and Netanyahu aide Dore Gold could meet on Thursday . He quoted Ross as telling him : \" The important thing is the Israelis are prepared to move . \" Arafat said he replied : \" is this like their previous promises ? \" \" No , they have good intentions , \" Arafat quoted Ross as saying . Palestinians have been pressing Israel to carry out a long-delayed partial troop pullout from the flashpoint West Bank city of Hebron agreed by the previous Labour government . The Israeli government is studying redeployment plans submitted by Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai which are likely to demand a wider than agreed army presence in Hebron .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 3723], "labels": [[[0, 6], "Q34211"], [[12, 18], "Q801"], [[35, 47], "Unknown"], [[50, 58], "Unknown"], [[59, 67], "Q158119"], [[70, 79], "Unknown"], [[91, 102], "Q23792"], [[113, 126], "Q34211"], [[150, 156], "Q801"], [[181, 193], "Q23792"], [[241, 250], "Unknown"], [[255, 259], "Q47492"], [[349, 356], "Q801"], [[420, 431], "Q23792"], [[443, 449], "Q34211"], [[459, 470], "Q23792"], [[494, 501], "Q801"], [[517, 535], "Q43723"], [[551, 557], "Q34211"], [[671, 677], "Q801"], [[728, 734], "Q7325"], [[749, 761], "Unknown"], [[807, 826], "Unknown"], [[831, 837], "Q801"], [[861, 870], "Q1218"], [[909, 918], "Q1218"], [[930, 936], "Q34211"], [[945, 951], "Q13955"], [[973, 984], "Q23792"], [[999, 1008], "Q1218"], [[1011, 1020], "Q43723"], [[1078, 1084], "Q34211"], [[1119, 1128], "Q1218"], [[1157, 1166], "Unknown"], [[1171, 1181], "Q39760"], [[1246, 1253], "Q801"], [[1375, 1382], "Q801"], [[1405, 1416], "Q23792"], [[1430, 1444], "Q212938"], [[1449, 1458], "Q5776"], [[1504, 1515], "Q23792"], [[1596, 1602], "Q801"], [[1609, 1621], "Q23792"], [[1714, 1721], "Q218"], [[1726, 1731], "Q865"], [[1752, 1759], "Q432"], [[1772, 1784], "Q23792"], [[1788, 1794], "Q801"], [[1812, 1821], "Q1218"], [[1827, 1834], "Q425281"], [[1853, 1857], "Q7325"], [[1862, 1872], "Unknown"], [[1937, 1943], "Q34211"], [[1964, 1973], "Q43723"], [[2030, 2036], "Q34211"], [[2050, 2057], "Q801"], [[2106, 2112], "Q432"], [[2175, 2180], "Q35323"], [[2188, 2197], "Unknown"], [[2202, 2206], "Q47492"], [[2221, 2230], "Q1218"], [[2233, 2242], "Q43723"], [[2296, 2305], "Q1218"], [[2358, 2364], "Q210703"], [[2380, 2392], "Q57410"], [[2428, 2432], "Unknown"], [[2465, 2477], "Q23792"], [[2480, 2486], "Q801"], [[2496, 2510], "Q212938"], [[2523, 2534], "Q7204"], [[2595, 2598], "Unknown"], [[2605, 2619], "Q212938"], [[2647, 2658], "Q23792"], [[2710, 2716], "Q34211"], [[2866, 2882], "Unknown"], [[2889, 2900], "Q1189483"], [[2921, 2926], "Q90"], [[2943, 2950], "Q801"], [[2955, 2963], "Q79"], [[2981, 2987], "Q34211"], [[3028, 3031], "Unknown"], [[3043, 3056], "Q127998"], [[3075, 3084], "Q127998"], [[3091, 3100], "Q43723"], [[3106, 3115], "Q5297642"], [[3151, 3155], "Q1189483"], [[3202, 3210], "Q801"], [[3236, 3242], "Q34211"], [[3341, 3347], "Q34211"], [[3355, 3359], "Q1189483"], [[3372, 3384], "Q23792"], [[3404, 3410], "Q801"], [[3481, 3490], "Unknown"], [[3499, 3505], "Q168225"], [[3529, 3535], "Q210703"], [[3553, 3560], "Q801"], [[3633, 3650], "Q29427"], [[3715, 3721], "Q168225"]]}

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "US investors mull appeal of Lloyd 's decision . Patricia Vowinkel NEW YORK 1996-08-27 U.S. investors in troubled Lloyd 's of London were considering late on Tuesday whether to appeal a U.S. court decision in favour of Lloyd 's and pledged to continue pursuing other legal actions . A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday gave Lloyd 's a reprieve , throwing out an injunction that the insurance giant said could have led to its collapse . A lower court issued the injunction on Friday and ordered Lloyd 's to give investors , known as Names , more information before requiring them to decide whether to accept a settlement offer as part of a reorganisation plan . \" My prediction is that the Names will appeal , \" said Kenneth Chiate , a U.S. Name and a chief negotiator for the American Names Association . \" At this point , it is a sufficiently important decision that I 'm confident that they will appeal , \" he said . \" But to say that they definitely will would be premature until we determine what the exact basis for the court 's ruling is . \" Under the reorganisation plan , Lloyd 's plans to reinsure its massive liabilities into a new company called Equitas . The arrangement calls for investors to make additional payments to fund Equitas but also provides them with 3.2 billion stg in compensation to help reduce their prior outstanding liabilities . The Names had been scheduled to decide whether to accept or reject the offer by 1100 GMT Wednesday , but Lloyd 's chairman David Rowland said on Tuesday the offer would be extended . At least eight U.S. states have still some form of litigation pending , said John Head , spokesman for the Association of Lloyd 's State Chairmen , a group representing U.S. Names . \" It goes without saying that we 're rather disappointed , \" Head said of the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit , sitting in Baltimore . But , he said , \" we still have hope that somebody is going to see our point of view in this . \" The Colorado attorney general told Lloyd 's last week it was considering a new legal action against the British insurance market , based on allegations of consumer fraud . \" We have notified them of our concerns and asked them to give us a response , \" said Colorado attorney general Gale Norton . Norton said she was concerned that the Lloyd 's agreement immunizes it from future litigation regarding Equitas and requires that all legal actions be heard outside of Colorado . In addition , she said she was concerned the plan may not offer investors enough protection from additional , future liabilities . Meanwhile , an appeal of a lawsuit filed by some 600 Names in California is still pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit , Chiate of the American Names Association said . That lawsuit , which seeks rescision and restitution , was dismissed in a U.S. district court . That case \" is what I call the most significant alternate remedy for us , \" Chiate said . The individual Names , however , now must decide whether to accept Lloyd 's settlement offer or reject the offer and pursue litigation . Chiate said he has advised Names that \" they must make , individually , a risk benefit analysis . \" Rejection involved forfeiting the compensation offer and risking the possibility of owing Lloyd 's two to three times more than Lloyd 's is now willing to accept , he said . But , in rejecting the offer , the Names would retain their rights to pursue litigation , he said .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 3480], "labels": [[[0, 2], "Unknown"], [[28, 36], "Unknown"], [[48, 65], "Unknown"], [[66, 74], "Q60"], [[86, 90], "Q30"], [[113, 131], "Unknown"], [[185, 189], "Q30"], [[218, 226], "Unknown"], [[284, 288], "Q30"], [[319, 327], "Unknown"], [[489, 497], "Unknown"], [[527, 532], "Unknown"], [[684, 689], "Unknown"], [[711, 725], "Unknown"], [[730, 734], "Q30"], [[735, 739], "Unknown"], [[771, 797], "Unknown"], [[1075, 1083], "Unknown"], [[1152, 1159], "Q5384639"], [[1234, 1241], "Q5384639"], [[1359, 1364], "Unknown"], [[1440, 1443], "Q30192"], [[1460, 1468], "Unknown"], [[1478, 1491], "Unknown"], [[1553, 1557], "Q30"], [[1615, 1624], "Unknown"], [[1645, 1668], "Unknown"], [[1707, 1711], "Q30"], [[1712, 1717], "Unknown"], [[1781, 1785], "Unknown"], [[1814, 1835], "Q1641851"], [[1844, 1858], "Q250463"], [[1872, 1881], "Q5092"], [[1985, 1993], "Q1261"], [[2016, 2024], "Unknown"], [[2085, 2092], "Q145"], [[2239, 2247], "Q1261"], [[2265, 2276], "Q271717"], [[2279, 2285], "Q271717"], [[2318, 2326], "Unknown"], [[2383, 2390], "Q5384639"], [[2447, 2455], "Q1261"], [[2642, 2647], "Unknown"], [[2651, 2661], "Q99"], [[2690, 2711], "Q1641851"], [[2720, 2733], "Unknown"], [[2736, 2742], "Unknown"], [[2750, 2776], "Unknown"], [[2858, 2862], "Q30"], [[2956, 2962], "Unknown"], [[2985, 2990], "Unknown"], [[3037, 3045], "Unknown"], [[3107, 3113], "Unknown"], [[3134, 3139], "Unknown"], [[3297, 3305], "Unknown"], [[3335, 3343], "Unknown"], [[3416, 3421], "Unknown"]]}

TOKYO 1996-08-28 The leader of a junior partner in Japan 's three-party ruling coalition plans to resign to quell a political rebellion , party officials said on Wednesday . The officials said New Party Sakigake President Masayoshi Takemura , finance minister until the beginning of this year , promised his resignation in a meeting with the politician who set off the rebellion in the smallest coalition member . They said the date of Takemura 's resignation would be determined by party officials . The Sakigake row has caused jitters in its coalition partners , Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto 's Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) , the biggest grouping , and the Social Democratic Party . But analysts said the row was not expected to immediately destabilise the government as even if Sakigake splits apart it has so few seats a loss of support would not lead to a general election . The dispute pits Takemura , who founded Sakigake in 1993 as a reform-oriented LDP splinter group , against party official Yukio Hatoyama , who says he will leave Sakigake to form a reformist political group next month . Hatoyama , the 49-year-old grandson of a 1950s prime minister , on Tuesday quit as Sakigake secretary general and has publicly snubbed the 62-year-old Takemura , pointedly ruling his mentor out as a possible member of the new political force . Marathon talks between the two former allies on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning failed to resolve the dispute over the role of Takemura , seen by Hatoyama backers as tainted by his senior role in the LDP-dominated coalition . The presence of Takemura , whose role as finance minister in passing an unpopular plan to use taxpayer funds to wind up failed housing loan firms ruined his reputation as a reformer , has stalled Hatoyama 's efforts to attract to his new group defectors from the opposition camp , analysts said . Media reports say that at most 10 of 23 Sakigake members , joined by a handful of Social Democrats , will follow Hatoyama when he bolts -- far short of the 50 lawmakers needed to topple Hashimoto 's eight-month-old government . Hashimoto -- who returns from a 10-day Latin American tour on Saturday -- must call polls by mid-1997 , and has repeatedly said he would not call an early general election .

Evelyn Leopold UNITED NATIONS 1996-08-28 Iraq has balked at the number of U.N. staff needed to implement the oil-for-food deal , blaming the United States for insisting on stringent monitoring . In comments to reporters and a statement on Tuesday , Iraqi diplomats said the cost of the monitors and other staff , which Baghdad has to finance , surpasses funds allocated for electricity , water , sewers , education and agriculture . At issue was a May 20 agreement allowing Iraq to sell $ 2 billion worth of oil to purchase badly needed food , medicine and other supplies to ease the impact of sanctions in force since its troops invaded Kuwait in August 1990 . The Iraqi statement said the United States was \" interfering and pressing to augment the number of international staff and this is not legal and not justified . \" Iraq 's deputy ambassador , Saeed Hasan , noted that the May 20 accord said that the number of personnel would be determined by the United Nations and that the government of Iraq would be consulted . Saeed in his comments did not threaten to call off the deal and the U.N. officials said they expected it to go into force next month after Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali reports that arrangements are in place . The U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs ( DHA ) , which has to coordinate the distribution of food , medicine and other goods , increased the number of monitors earlier this month at the insistence of the United States . According to U.N. officials and diplomats , Iraq would have about $ 1.13 billion to spend for food , medicine and other goods after monies for a reparations fund for Gulf War victims and costs for U.N. weapons inspections were deducted . The cost of the U.N. staff overseeing the distribution of food and other supplies was estimated to cost $ 31 million . In addition another $ 12 million was anticipated to cover other expenses , such as oil experts and administrative costs . For the distribution and supervision of humanitarian supplies the United Nations estimated it needed 1,190 people , including 267 international staff and 923 Iraqi support staff . Of this number 64 foreign and 598 local staff would be in the northern Kurdish provinces , no longer the direct control of the Baghdad government . Another 203 international staff and 325 Iraqis would run the programme in the central and southern parts of the country .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "EU Commission cool on changing beef cull plan . BRUSSELS 1996-08-29 The European Commission said on Thursday it would study scientific reports saying Britain 's mad cow epidemic would die out by 2001 but offered little prospect the findings would change an agreed slaughter campaign . \" Obviously we are interested in this research . We will ask the ( EU ) scientific and veterinary committee to examine it , \" Commission spokesman Gerard Kiely told Reuters . But he added that new research into the dynamics of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE ) , a fatal brain-wasting disease suffered by cattle , was unlikely to alter a slaughter plan agreed by Britain and its 14 EU partners . \" We agreed that following detailed scientific analysis using a methodology which would take out the maximum number of BSE cases possible . I think it would be very difficult to sell to the European Commission a programme which would involve the elimination of fewer BSE cases , \" Kiely said . \" We will look at our approach ( to the plan ) but we wo n't get involved with the number of animals to be slaughtered , \" he said . \" We have always avoided the question of numbers of animals to be slaughtered , that 's not the issue . The issue is the protection of consumers ' health and the rapid eradication of BSE , \" he added . The reaction is likely to disappoint British farmers , who seized on research by Oxford scientists in the scientific journal Nature saying it would be hard to get rid of the disease any faster than 2001 without killing vast numbers of cattle . The researchers predicted there would be 340 new infections and 14,000 new cases of BSE before 2001 . British farmers ' leader called on Wednesday for an urgent meeting with ministers to discuss the report . \" I hope the government will now make it clear they believe there is a better way of dealing with this issue , \" National Farmers Union president Sir David Naish told BBC radio . Naish said there was no need for Britain to carry out a planned cull of some 147,000 cattle to which it had reluctantly agreed to placate its European partners . \" The new evidence to me means some of that proposal should be re-examined because we could get away with considerably less animals being culled if in fact scientists throughout Europe accepted this evidence , \" Naish said . The report could well reopen a damaging row between Britain and the EU , which slapped a worldwide ban on British beef after the government said there could be a link between BSE and the human form of the disease . The issue flared in in March when government scientists admitted that people could become infected with Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease ( CJD ) from eating BSE-infected beef .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 2723], "labels": [[[0, 13], "Q8880"], [[48, 56], "Q240"], [[72, 91], "Q8880"], [[150, 157], "Q145"], [[352, 354], "Unknown"], [[411, 421], "Q8880"], [[432, 444], "Unknown"], [[450, 457], "Q130879"], [[551, 554], "Q154666"], [[659, 666], "Q145"], [[678, 680], "Unknown"], [[811, 814], "Q154666"], [[882, 901], "Q8880"], [[959, 962], "Q154666"], [[973, 978], "Unknown"], [[1302, 1305], "Q154666"], [[1358, 1365], "Q145"], [[1402, 1408], "Q34433"], [[1446, 1452], "Q180445"], [[1649, 1652], "Q154666"], [[1667, 1674], "Q145"], [[1886, 1908], "Unknown"], [[1923, 1934], "Unknown"], [[1940, 1949], "Unknown"], [[1952, 1957], "Unknown"], [[1985, 1992], "Q145"], [[2094, 2102], "Q458"], [[2292, 2298], "Q46"], [[2326, 2331], "Unknown"], [[2391, 2398], "Q145"], [[2407, 2409], "Unknown"], [[2445, 2452], "Q145"], [[2514, 2517], "Q154666"], [[2658, 2683], "Q49989"], [[2686, 2689], "Q49989"], [[2704, 2716], "Unknown"]]}

MANCHESTER , England 1996-08-29 Tight bowling from Glamorgan off-spinner Robert Croft helped England to restrict Pakistan to 225 for five in their 50 overs in the first one-day international at Old Trafford on Thursday . Croft , who was one of the few Englishmen to make a good impression in his test debut at The Oval last week , showed great control as he first dried up the early flow of Pakistan runs and then collected the wickets of Aamir Sohail and Wasim Akram in a spell of 10-1-36-2 . There was also a wicket each for Ronnie Irani , Allan Mullally and Darren Gough although there was no joy for Dean Headley who , along with Lancashire batsman Graham Lloyd , was making his international debut . After Wasim had won the toss and chosen to bat first , Pakistani made an excellent start as Sohail and Saeed Anwar continued their good form with an opening partnership of 82 . Anwar , who struck a superb 176 at The Oval , was the more aggressive as he made 57 from 75 balls before skying a catch off Irani to Mullally at long-on . Sohail and Ijaz Ahmed then added 59 for the second wicket before England struck back with three wickets for 19 in the space of five overs . First , Sohail , after making 48 , was bowled by Croft as he stepped back to try and hit through the off-side .

SEATTLE 1996-08-29 Jay Buhner hit a three-run homer and former Yankee Terry Mulholland allowed one run over seven innings as the Seattle Mariners completed a sweep of New York with a 10-2 victory in a game marred by a bench-clearing brawl . Including the last three games of last October 's Divisional Playoff Series , the Mariners have beaten the Yankees 12 of the past 15 meetings overall and 14 of the last 16 in the Kingdome . Five players were ejected after Yankees ' outfielder Paul O'Neill and Seattle catcher John Marzano got into a fight after O'Neill had been brushed back . In Baltimore , Don Wengert threw a nine-hitter for his first shutout and Jose Herrera had a two-run double in a three-run fifth inning as the Oakland Athletics blanked the Baltimore Orioles 3-0 . Wengert ( 7-9 ) , who failed to record a shutout in his previous 86 starts in either the minors or majors , did not walk a batter and struck out three for Oakland . In Chicago , James Baldwin scattered five hits over seven scoreless innings and Ray Durham and Ozzie Guillen had RBI hits in the second inning as the Chicago White Sox blanked the Milwaukee Brewers 2-0 . Baldwin ( 10-4 ) struck out four and did not walk a batter for Chicago , which won for only the fourth time in 15 games . Dave Nilsson had three hits for the Brewers . In Kansas City , Jose Offerman 's single with two out in the 12th inning scored Johnny Damon with the winning run and lifted the Kansas City Royals to a 4-3 victory over the Texas Rangers . Rick Huisman ( 1-1 ) allowed one hit and a walk in the 12th to post his first major-league win . In Toronto , Pat Hentgen tossed a five-hitter for his fifth consecutive complete game and three players drove in two runs apiece as the Toronto Blue Jays defeated the Minnesota Twins 6-1 for their ninth win in 11 games . Hentgen ( 17-7 ) surrendered just three doubles and a pair of singles in tossing his major-league leading ninth complete game . He walked three and struck out three in winning for the 10th time in his last 11 decisions .

Michael Conlon CHICAGO 1996-08-29 President Bill Clinton 's triumphal appearance at the Democratic convention , a vital moment in his bid for a second term , was marred on Thursday by the resignation of a top adviser in a reported sex scandal . Clinton was at work on the nomination acceptance speech that will launch his 10-week re-election campaign when political strategist Dick Morris abruptly announced his resignation on Thursday . The tabloid Star magazine reported the married Morris had a lengthy affair with a $ 200-an-hour prostitute who he allowed to eavesdrop on telephone conversations with Clinton , and with whom he shared White House speeches before they were made . \" Dick Morris is my friend , and he is a superb political strategist , \" Clinton said in a written statement . \" I am and always will be grateful for the great contributions he has made to my campaigns and for the invaluable work he has done for me over the last two years . \" Morris declined to address the allegations directly in his resignation statement but said he was quitting to avoid becoming a campaign issue . The surprise development captivated the thousands of reporters at the convention and clearly worried some Democrats , who had planned a triumphal celebration of Clinton 's lead over Dole in the opinion polls . Senator Dianne Feinstein , a California Democrat , called it a \" big bump \" in the way of the Clinton campaign . \" It comes at the worst possible time on one of the biggest days for the president , \" Feinstein said . Clinton was to deliver his acceptance speech at the final session of the Democratic Convention opening at 8 p.m. EDT ( midnight GMT ) . The 50-year-old president has been dogged for years by allegations of financial wrongdoing , sexual misconduct and questionable judgment in selecting his advisers . Republicans hope to seize on the \" character \" issue to bolster Clinton 's challenger Bob Dole in the final weeks of the campaign . Speaking in Santa Barbara , California , Dole did not directly refer to the sexual scandal but said the departure of Morris , who had advised Clinton to chart a more centrist political course , would make Clinton drift back to the left . \" Morris has been trying to make President Clinton a Republican , now maybe he 'll revert to the liberal Democrat that he really is , \" Dole told reporters . Clinton will hit the road on Friday for a bus tour across several states in his fight to become the first Democratic incumbent re-elected to a second term since the days of Franklin D. Roosevelt . Aides said Clinton planned to spend most of Thursday in his hotel room several miles ( km ) from the convention hall working on his speech . It was apparently neglected on his long \" whistle-stop \" train trip to the convention , during which he revelled in contact with friendly crowds across the country 's heartland . He was also hoarse and was giving his voice a rest . But first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton told ABC television , \" He 's really fired up . \" \" He wants to outline to the American people what he thinks has been accomplished in the last four years , and what he would like to see done in the next four years , \" she said . \" He 's very excited about this convention ... He 's excited about the campaign . But more than that , he 's very resolute about what he wants to do . \" \" I do n't take anything for granted . I always expect elections to get close . I expect to have a great deal of up and down days between now and then , \" she said of the November 5 election date . Clinton is leading Dole by as much as 15 points according to some polls . The campaign pits Dole , a man of quick and withering wit and long-time public service , but stilted speaking style , against the glib and confident Clinton , who has perfected a style that makes direct eye contact with his audience .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 3905], "labels": [[[13, 20], "Q1124"], [[48, 62], "Unknown"], [[63, 70], "Q1297"], [[92, 104], "Q1124"], [[136, 146], "Q29552"], [[293, 300], "Q1124"], [[425, 436], "Q463009"], [[498, 511], "Unknown"], [[533, 539], "Q463009"], [[653, 660], "Q1124"], [[687, 698], "Q35525"], [[734, 745], "Q463009"], [[805, 812], "Q1124"], [[1009, 1015], "Q463009"], [[1258, 1267], "Q29552"], [[1313, 1320], "Q1124"], [[1334, 1338], "Q319079"], [[1370, 1386], "Q230733"], [[1391, 1401], "Q99"], [[1402, 1410], "Q29552"], [[1456, 1463], "Q1124"], [[1562, 1571], "Q230733"], [[1579, 1586], "Q1124"], [[1652, 1673], "Q1185865"], [[1707, 1710], "Q30192"], [[1880, 1891], "Q29468"], [[1944, 1951], "Q1124"], [[1966, 1974], "Q319079"], [[2024, 2037], "Q159288"], [[2040, 2050], "Q99"], [[2053, 2057], "Q319079"], [[2129, 2135], "Q463009"], [[2154, 2161], "Q1124"], [[2217, 2224], "Q1124"], [[2252, 2258], "Q463009"], [[2293, 2300], "Q1124"], [[2303, 2313], "Q29468"], [[2355, 2363], "Q29552"], [[2386, 2390], "Q319079"], [[2408, 2415], "Q1124"], [[2514, 2524], "Q29552"], [[2581, 2602], "Q8007"], [[2616, 2623], "Q1124"], [[2993, 3015], "Q6294"], [[3021, 3024], "Q169889"], [[3095, 3103], "Q30"], [[3597, 3604], "Q1124"], [[3616, 3620], "Q319079"], [[3689, 3693], "Q319079"], [[3820, 3827], "Q1124"]]}

PHILADELPHIA 1996-08-29 University of Pennsylvania researchers on Thursday said a new gene-therapy technique for treating muscular dystrophy disease had shown progress in laboratory animals .

Several hurdles must be overcome before the method is used in human trials . Nevertheless , \" a treatment based on the new strategy .... may have the potential to benefit many patients , \" the University of Pennsylvania Medical Centre said in a release . Muscular dystrophy is a fatal illness in which the body 's muscle tissue degenerates and is replaced by fat . Death strikes in early adulthood . Individuals with the disease have a non-working version of a gene responsible for producing a crucial muscle protein called dystrophin . In the study at the University 's Institute for Human Gene Therapy , researchers altered a common-cold virus to carry a version of the working dystrophin gene . The virus , which also was altered to minimise its susceptibility to the immune system , was then injected into the muscle cells of mice bred to lack dystrophin genes . In the experiment , between 30 to 40 percent of the muscle fibers in one group of mice produced dystrophin for two weeks before diminishing . Similar results had been obtained previously in test-tube cell cultures , but not in live animals , the university said . The university said methods are still needed to make enough of the altered virus to treat humans , to further decrease the immune-system response to the virus , and to deliver the virus to human muscle tissue .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 1803], "labels": [[[52, 64], "Q1345"], [[76, 102], "Q49117"], [[320, 338], "Unknown"], [[373, 395], "Unknown"], [[655, 681], "Q49117"], [[1033, 1065], "Unknown"]]}

Leila Corcoran WASHINGTON 1996-08-29 A freed black man writes to his still-enslaved wife , a mother pleads with Abraham Lincoln on behalf of her son and a maimed soldier poses for an official photograph in newly reopened records that bring the U.S. Civil War back to life . Working in the basement of the National Archives , members of the Civil War Conservation Corps are organising the military records of volunteers who fought for the North so that they can be preserved on microfilm . The faded documents have been stowed away in the Archives since it opened in 1935 and have rarely seen the light of day . Each soldier 's file is a gold mine of information : enlistment papers , muster rolls , medical records , discharge certificates , letters and photographs . Since the project began almost two years ago , corps volunteers have focused on African American troops , preparing records in time for the unveiling in Washington this year of a special memorial to black soldiers who fought in the war . More than 185,000 black soldiers fought and 37,000 died . In one letter , a black soldier heading South wrote his wife , \" though great is the present national difficulties yet I look forward to a brighter day when I shall have the oportunity of seeing you in the full enjoyment of freedom . \" I would like to no ( sic ) if you are still in slavery if you are , it will not be long before we shall have crushed the system that now oppreses you for in the course of three months you shall have your liberty . Great is the outpouring of the coloured people that is now rallying with the heart of lions against the very curse that has separated you and me . \" In another letter dated January 1865 , a well-to-do Washington matron wrote to Lincoln to plead for her son , who faced a dishonourable discharge from the Army . \" James is a prisoner for a thoughtless act of folly , while those who have done nothing for the cause are free , \" she wrote . Lincoln 's notation on the letter read : \" If his colonel will say in writing on this sheet he is willing to receive this man back to the regiment , I will pardon and send him . \" The soldier was subsequently pardoned . While the letters speak to the anguish of separation , a photograph of a black amputee speaks to the terrible physical cost of the war . In a picture required for his military discharge , Pvt . Lewis Martin , with haunted eyes , posed bare-chested to reveal his missing arm and leg , blown off during a battle at Petersburg , Virginia , in July 1864 . The work on black troops has provided new insight into the rhythms of plantation talk and culture , said John Simon , professor of history at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale and editor of Gen . Ulysses Grant 's papers . \" These ( writings ) are not only poetic but a linguistic treasure trove . This is the first generation of African Americans that really can express itself without fear and punishment , \" Simon said . \" I think there 's probably a whole lot of material that would expand our understanding of the sociology of the war , \" said Edward Smith , director of American Studies at American University in Washington . The war between the North and South raged for nearly four years , claimed the lives of half a million Americans and forever seared the nation 's consciousness . Southern records have already been preserved . They were put on microfilm about 30 years ago through a grant from the United Daughters of the Confederacy . The Civil War Conservation Corps is mostly retirees joined by students during the school year . Director Budge Weidman , who has shepherded the project from the beginning , predicts it will take up to a decade to complete . The work was inspired by a National Park Service plan to put computer databases at Civil War battlefields across the country so that Americans might research their ancestors . The records also provide insight into medical thinking of the day .

Sylvie Florence AJACCIO , Corsica 1996-08-29 Separatist guerrillas planted two bombs overnight at government offices on the French Mediterranean island of Corsica despite fresh warnings of a crackdown by Paris , police said on Thursday . In the latest in a wave of attacks , a two kg ( four lb ) bomb seriously damaged two floors of Agriculture Ministry offices located just 50 metres ( yards ) from a police station in the centre of the island capital Ajaccio . No one was hurt . A second device , packed with five kg ( 10 lbs ) of explosive , was defused before it could go off , police said . The new attacks followed by a day a warning of a new \" get-tough \" policy by Paris toward the separatists , who seek greater autonomy . Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre , under fire for staging secret talks with one of the largest of several rival underground nationalist groups , told the daily La Corse in a statement he had given \" firm orders \" to police to round up those responsible for the bombings and bring them to justice . Judges on the island had accused Paris of taking a lax stance on guerrilla violence while conducting secret but widely-reported talks with separatists which have now failed . The latest bombing , close on the heels of the new orders , brought charges that police were powerless . \" No searches , no arrests , no police reinforcements visible on the island , despite the ministry 's promises , \" the daily France-Soir lamented . \" On the island , as at the Place Beauvau ( the Interior Ministry 's Paris address ) , people are well aware who is who and who is doing what .

Corsica has been racked by low-level separatist-inspired violence , principally directed against government targets , for two decades . The daily Le Monde reported on Wednesday some separatist movements were considering taking their attacks to the French mainland on the principle that \" 300 grammes of explosives on the continent have more impact than 300 kilos in Corsica \" . The newspaper said separatists may take advantage of social unrest widely expected on the mainland in coming weeks over government austerity plans to stoke a popular backlash against the government .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 2555], "labels": [[[20, 27], "Q14112"], [[52, 67], "Unknown"], [[68, 75], "Q40104"], [[78, 85], "Q14112"], [[176, 182], "Q142"], [[183, 196], "Q4918"], [[207, 214], "Q14112"], [[256, 261], "Q90"], [[385, 405], "Unknown"], [[505, 512], "Q40104"], [[725, 730], "Q90"], [[802, 818], "Q713235"], [[946, 954], "Unknown"], [[1117, 1122], "Q90"], [[1489, 1500], "Q1440784"], [[1540, 1553], "Q3389720"], [[1560, 1577], "Q1518496"], [[1581, 1586], "Q90"], [[1727, 1736], "Q216047"], [[1978, 1985], "Q14112"], [[2124, 2132], "Q12461"], [[2226, 2232], "Q142"], [[2344, 2351], "Q14112"]]}

LONDON 1996-08-29 The chairman of British-based components and engineering group T&N Plc said on Thursday the firm remained confident about the general prospects for its operating margins despite pressure from unsettled markets . In an interview following its first-half results , which included a less optimistic forecast for the second half of this year than it had made in the past , Sir Colin Hope said T&N had taken defensive action to protect it from patchy markets . Looking at market prospects , he said : \" I think our best judgment at this stage is that it will probably bumble along in the rather mixed way it 's been in the first half . \" \" It 's very difficult to predict the market ( trend ) this year . It could be better , or it could be worse , \" Hope added , echoing the demand uncertainty across automotive industries . \" You can see anxieties in Germany and France , in particular , beginning to grow and develop . America , however , is looking a little better , \" he said . Compared with the end of last year , when T&N predicted a sluggish first half and a rebound later in 1996 , Hope said : \" I think the difference ( now ) is the first half has not actually been as bad as some felt it was going to be , but equally we 're certainly not predicting a recovery in the second half . \" Against this background , Hope said the group was glad it had rationalised and destocked even though this had pressed margins , which had slipped to 9.5 percent from 11.3 percent a year ago . \" I think the figure of 9.5 percent on the first half , when you consider the fact that we 've been destocking , the fairly mixed customer demand , and the fact that we sold the ( southern African ) mines actually is not bad . \" It does show how easily we should be able to bounce back over 10 percent again , \" he added , saying : \" We continue to feel very relaxed about our general view that we would average 10 percent profit margins over the cycle . \" \" We 've always taken the view that we are the sort of company that 's quite capable of working in difficult circumstances -- we 're rather used to it .

Tsang , who made the remarks during a visit to New Zealand , also spoke strongly in favour of keeping the Hong Kong dollar pegged to its U.S. counterpart , and said negotiations with China on next year 's budget were going smoothly . Hong Kong 's economy grew by only 3.1 percent in the first quarter , down from 5.9 percent a year earlier , and some private sector economists have revised downwards their predictions for the 1996 year . Second quarter growth estimates will be released when the Hong Kong government issues its half-yearly economic report on Friday . \" Our trend growth rate of five percent in real terms is pretty solid , \" Tsang told a news conference after meeting New Zealand Finance Minister Bill Birch . \" There will be fluctuations in individual years , but it wo n't be a big margin , \" he said .

HONG KONG 1996-08-29 Senior Hong Kong civil servants were given the go-ahead on Thursday to challenge a government ban on them standing for the Beijing-backed panel to choose the territory 's first post-handover leader and lawmakers . The Supreme Court ruled that a judicial hearing contesting the ban would be heard on September 11 , three days before the nomination period for the Selection Committee closes . The government maintains the ban , announced earlier this month , is necessary to avoid a possible conflict of interest because civil servants are involved in determining government policy . Civil servants argue the ban stymies their political rights . The 400-strong Selection Committee will select Hong Kong 's future chief executive to replace the British governor and a provisional legislature to take over from the elected chamber which Beijing plans to dissolve . Hong Kong , a British colony for more than 150 years , will be handed back to China at midnight on June 30 next year . China intends to dismantle the territory 's first fully-elected legislature because it opposes Britain 's recent electoral reforms and install an interim appointed chamber , a decision that has generated considerable controversy . The judicial review sought by directorate-grade bureaucrats will apply to only about 1,000 of the approximately 33,000 civil servants affected . Police unions are not contesting the ban , which affects all 27,000 officers , and nor are the very top tier of Hong Kong 's mandarin class , the policy secretaries .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "Wall Street ponders Rubin 's role if Clinton wins . Donna Sells NEW YORK The outcome of the November elections emerged as a hot topic on Wall Street this week as financial pundits debated whether Robert Rubin might forgo a second term as Treasury secretary if President Clinton is re-elected . Concern centred on the currency markets since Rubin 's tour de force has been his unflagging support of the dollar . Speculation that Rubin might not stay in his post grew after he sidestepped questions about any future Cabinet post during television interviews at the Democratic convention in Chicago this week . Should Rubin leave , Wall Street would worry that he might take his strong-dollar policy with him . Rubin 's predecessor at the Treasury , Lloyd Bentsen , was viewed with suspicion by some in the financial markets who thought he had tried to push down the dollar to gain an edge in trade negotiations with Japan . \" Obviously , under the Clinton administration , we 've seen two distinctively different dollar policies , \" said Chris Widness , an international economist at Chase Securities Inc. \" Under Rubin , the U.S. has certainly looked for a strong dollar . \" That strategy , backed up by timely instances of joint central bank intervention , helped the dollar battle back from post-Second World War lows of 1.3438 German marks on March 8 , 1995 , and 79.75 Japanese yen on April 19 , 1995 . Currently , the dollar stands at about 1.48 marks and 109 yen . Rubin was widely hailed as the architect of the dollar 's comeback , using skills and expertise gained in 26 years on Wall Street , part of which were spent as co-chairman of Goldman , Sachs and Co . Inc . \" Rubin has done a fine job in that position , \" said Michael Faust , a portfolio manager at Bailard , Biehl and Kaiser , which manages just under $ 1 billion in global stocks and bonds . \" Anyone who would come in there to replace him would have awfully big shoes to fill . \" Fear that a new Treasury secretary might favour a return to Bentsen-era policy could spell trouble for financial markets . Some overseas investors might shy away from buying U.S. stocks and bonds or even sell them when the dollar is weakening . As for U.S. Treasury securities , Widness explained that Alan Greenspan 's reappointment as chairman of the Federal Reserve and the outlook for the federal budget were more important than whether Rubin continues at the Treasury . \" Although , if we did get someone that was seen as looking for a dollar depreciation , it would probably hurt capital flows to the United States , \" said Widness , adding that could hurt U.S. stocks and , to a lesser degree , bonds . Still , markets may have little to fear from any Rubin successor because the firm dollar policy has yielded positive results . If that is true , then any new Treasury chief would need to be as effective as Rubin in convincing markets that the White House does indeed want a strong currency . \" If he left , the first question people would ask the next guy is , ' What 's your view on the dollar ? ' \" said Michael Perelstein , portfolio manager of MainStay International Funds . \" And all I can say as a piece of advice is that they 'd better say exactly the same thing ( as Rubin ) , if not stronger , \" Perelstein said . \" Otherwise , you get selling out of Tokyo and Frankfurt again . \"", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 3352], "labels": [[[0, 11], "Q11690"], [[20, 25], "Q370316"], [[37, 44], "Q1124"], [[52, 63], "Unknown"], [[64, 72], "Q60"], [[137, 148], "Q11690"], [[196, 208], "Q370316"], [[238, 246], "Q648666"], [[270, 277], "Q1124"], [[340, 345], "Q370316"], [[428, 433], "Q370316"], [[514, 521], "Q640506"], [[563, 573], "Q29552"], [[588, 595], "Q1297"], [[615, 620], "Q370316"], [[629, 640], "Q11690"], [[708, 713], "Q370316"], [[736, 744], "Q648666"], [[747, 760], "Q455401"], [[914, 919], "Q17"], [[946, 953], "Q1124"], [[1036, 1049], "Unknown"], [[1082, 1103], "Unknown"], [[1112, 1117], "Q370316"], [[1124, 1128], "Q30"], [[1292, 1313], "Unknown"], [[1329, 1335], "Q183"], [[1372, 1380], "Q17"], [[1470, 1475], "Q370316"], [[1588, 1599], "Q11690"], [[1645, 1673], "Unknown"], [[1678, 1683], "Q370316"], [[1730, 1743], "Unknown"], [[1769, 1795], "Unknown"], [[1969, 1977], "Q648666"], [[2013, 2024], "Unknown"], [[2127, 2131], "Q30"], [[2205, 2218], "Q648666"], [[2232, 2239], "Unknown"], [[2255, 2269], "Q193635"], [[2306, 2321], "Q53536"], [[2394, 2399], "Q370316"], [[2417, 2425], "Q648666"], [[2560, 2573], "Q30"], [[2583, 2590], "Unknown"], [[2616, 2620], "Q30"], [[2712, 2717], "Q370316"], [[2821, 2829], "Q648666"], [[2869, 2874], "Q370316"], [[2906, 2917], "Q35525"], [[3069, 3087], "Unknown"], [[3111, 3139], "Unknown"], [[3238, 3243], "Q370316"], [[3268, 3278], "Unknown"], [[3323, 3328], "Q1490"], [[3333, 3342], "Q1794"]]}

Russia 's Svetlana Samokhalova fought off a spirited challenge from American Jane Quigley to take the title for a second year . Russia , the only nation to have two riders in the field , made full use of their numerical superiority . Goulnara Fatkoullina helped Samokhalova to build an unbeatable points lead before snatching the bronze medal . Quigley , a former medallist in the points event , led the race at half distance . \" I went so close this time , but having two riders certainly gave the Russians an advantage , \" she said . The first six riders lapped the field , which left former world champion Ingrid Haringa of the Netherlands down in seventh place despite having the second highest points score . Olympic champion Nathalie Lancien of France also missed the winning attack and finished a disappointing 10th .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 1587], "labels": [[[10, 19], "Q255482"], [[50, 62], "Unknown"], [[63, 73], "Q18125"], [[76, 83], "Q21"], [[95, 112], "Q255482"], [[116, 122], "Q142"], [[261, 270], "Q255482"], [[276, 283], "Q183"], [[287, 301], "Q446353"], [[371, 378], "Q8531"], [[408, 414], "Q142"], [[453, 465], "Unknown"], [[494, 509], "Q162148"], [[513, 519], "Q16"], [[526, 535], "Q255482"], [[763, 769], "Q159"], [[773, 793], "Unknown"], [[831, 839], "Q30"], [[840, 852], "Unknown"], [[891, 897], "Q159"], [[997, 1017], "Unknown"], [[1025, 1036], "Unknown"], [[1108, 1115], "Unknown"], [[1262, 1270], "Q159"], [[1372, 1386], "Unknown"], [[1394, 1405], "Q55"], [[1477, 1484], "Q8531"], [[1494, 1510], "Q441273"], [[1514, 1520], "Q142"]]}

LONDON 1996-08-30 West Indian all-rounder Phil Simmons took four for 38 on Friday as Leicestershire beat Somerset by an innings and 39 runs in two days to take over at the head of the county championship . Their stay on top , though , may be short-lived as title rivals Essex , Derbyshire and Surrey all closed in on victory while Kent made up for lost time in their rain-affected match against Nottinghamshire . After bowling Somerset out for 83 on the opening morning at Grace Road , Leicestershire extended their first innings by 94 runs before being bowled out for 296 with England discard Andy Caddick taking three for 83 . Trailing by 213 , Somerset got a solid start to their second innings before Simmons stepped in to bundle them out for 174 . Essex , however , look certain to regain their top spot after Nasser Hussain and Peter Such gave them a firm grip on their match against Yorkshire at Headingley . Hussain , considered surplus to England 's one-day requirements , struck 158 , his first championship century of the season , as Essex reached 372 and took a first innings lead of 82 . By the close Yorkshire had turned that into a 37-run advantage but off-spinner Such had scuttled their hopes , taking four for 24 in 48 balls and leaving them hanging on 119 for five and praying for rain . At the Oval , Surrey captain Chris Lewis , another man dumped by England , continued to silence his critics as he followed his four for 45 on Thursday with 80 not out on Friday in the match against Warwickshire . He was well backed by England hopeful Mark Butcher who made 70 as Surrey closed on 429 for seven , a lead of 234 . Derbyshire kept up the hunt for their first championship title since 1936 by reducing Worcestershire to 133 for five in their second innings , still 100 runs away from avoiding an innings defeat . Australian Tom Moody took six for 82 but Chris Adams , 123 , and Tim O'Gorman , 109 , took Derbyshire to 471 and a first innings lead of 233 . After the frustration of seeing the opening day of their match badly affected by the weather , Kent stepped up a gear to dismiss Nottinghamshire for 214 . They were held up by a gritty 84 from Paul Johnson but ex-England fast bowler Martin McCague took four for 55 .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "TENNIS - TARANGO , O'BRIEN SPRING TWIN UPSETS UNDER THE LIGHTS . Larry Fine NEW YORK 1996-08-30 Andre Agassi escaped disaster on Thursday but Wimbledon finalist MaliVai Washington and Marcelo Rios were not so fortunate on a night of upsets at the U.S. Open . The 11th-seeded Washington fell short of reprising his Wimbledon miracle comeback as he lost to red-hot wildcard Alex O'Brien 6-3 6-4 5-7 3-6 6-3 in a two hour 51 minute struggle on the Stadium court . Next door on the grandstand , 10th seed Rios lost to another player with a Wimbledon connection -- bad boy Jeff Tarango . The temperamental left-hander defeated the Chilean 6-4 4-6 7-6 6-2 . The day programme went smoothly although sixth-seeded former champion Agassi had to wriggle out of a dangerous 3-6 0-4 hole , winning 18 of the last 19 games against India 's Leander Paes . But the night belonged to the upstarts . Washington , who climbed back from a 1-5 deficit , two sets down in the third set against Todd Martin in the Wimbledon semifinals , looked poised for another sensational comeback . O'Brien , a winner two weeks ago in New Haven for his first pro title , served for the match at 5-4 in the third set before Washington came charging back . \" I just kept saying to myself , ' keep giving yourself the best chance to win , keep battling , maybe something will happen , ' \" said the 26-year-old O'Brien , ranked 65th . \" I kept my composure and I was proud of myself for that -- usually I would have folded up the tent and gone home . \" The hard-serving O'Brien , a former U.S. collegiate national champion , fired up 17 aces to ultimately subdue the never-say-die Washington . The fifth set stayed on serve until the sixth game , when Washington , after saving one break point with a forehand winner down the line , netted a backhand to give O'Brien a 4-2 lead . The Texan blasted in two aces to hold serve at 5-2 and then converted his eighth match point for victory when Washington found the net with another backhand from 40-0 . \" You just kind of keep fighting and you keep trying to make him play a little bit . I think he got a little tight at a couple of moments , \" said Washington . \" But I think he served pretty well when he had to . \" Tarango , whose Wimbledon tantrum two years ago brought him a $ 28,000 fine and suspension from this year 's tournament at the All-England Club , argued calls and taunted fans in his lively two hour , 24 minute tango with Rios on the grandstand . A boisterous cheering section backed the distracted Chilean and booed the lanky American , who ate up all the attention . \" I 'm an emotional player , \" said the 104th-ranked Tarango . \" I think I played very well tonight , very focused . \" The match turned on the third-set tiebreaker , which the American won 7-5 much to the dismay of the spectators . \" I love the crowd if they boo me every day . It fires me up , makes me play my best tennis , \" Tarango said . \" I played some of my best tennis in college when fraternities were throwing beer on me . If tennis was like that every day , I think everybody wold be having a lot more fun . \" Rios did not appreciate Tarango 's antics . \" He 's always complaining too much , \" said Rios . \" But I think it 's not that . I think I played really bad . It was tough to play at night . Balls were going really fast . I lost too many points that I never lose . I did n't play my tennis . \" \" I do n't see the ball like I see during the day . I play an American so that 's why I play at night . I did n't feel good on the court . \" At the end of the match , Tarango blew sarcastic kisses to the crowd , then jiggled his body to a Rios rooting section in a jeering salute . \" I support their enthusiasm , \" Tarango said about the fans . \" At the same time , they 're cheering blatantly against me . After I won I figured I could give them a little razzle-dazzle . \"", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 3880], "labels": [[[9, 16], "Q957450"], [[19, 26], "Unknown"], [[65, 75], "Unknown"], [[76, 84], "Q60"], [[96, 108], "Q7407"], [[142, 151], "Q912478"], [[161, 179], "Q54691"], [[184, 196], "Q272532"], [[247, 256], "Q123577"], [[275, 285], "Unknown"], [[314, 323], "Q41520"], [[372, 384], "Unknown"], [[501, 505], "Q272532"], [[536, 545], "Q41520"], [[568, 580], "Q957450"], [[626, 633], "Unknown"], [[722, 728], "Q7407"], [[818, 823], "Q668"], [[827, 839], "Q296282"], [[883, 893], "Q54691"], [[973, 984], "Q54536"], [[992, 1001], "Q41520"], [[1064, 1071], "Unknown"], [[1100, 1109], "Q49145"], [[1188, 1198], "Q54691"], [[1372, 1379], "Unknown"], [[1531, 1538], "Unknown"], [[1550, 1554], "Q30"], [[1642, 1652], "Q54691"], [[1713, 1723], "Q54691"], [[1820, 1827], "Unknown"], [[1845, 1850], "Unknown"], [[1951, 1961], "Q54691"], [[2157, 2167], "Q54691"], [[2225, 2232], "Q957450"], [[2241, 2250], "Q41520"], [[2352, 2368], "Unknown"], [[2447, 2451], "Q272532"], [[2524, 2531], "Unknown"], [[2552, 2560], "Unknown"], [[2647, 2654], "Q957450"], [[2770, 2778], "Unknown"], [[2922, 2929], "Q957450"], [[3115, 3119], "Q272532"], [[3139, 3146], "Q957450"], [[3204, 3208], "Q272532"], [[3469, 3477], "Unknown"], [[3574, 3581], "Q957450"], [[3646, 3650], "Q272532"], [[3722, 3729], "Q957450"]]}

CHICAGO 1996-08-30 U.S. debt futures finished a shortened pre-holiday session sharply lower , as the markets were shaken by a stronger than expected rise in the August National Association of Purchasing Management ( NAPM ) index for the Chicago area , traders and analysts said . The August Chicago NAPM rose 8.8 points to 60.0 , its highest level since 62.6 in February 1995 and the largest monthly rise since December 1993 . Primary dealers immediately sold Eurodollar and bond futures , after the market on average was expecting the index to rise marginally to 51.9 from July 's 51.2 . Traders also said Japanese investors were unwinding long Eurodollar futures / short swaps , and that heavy put buying helped pressure Eurodollars to lower levels before the close . One U.S. firm bought 35,000 September 97 mid-curve put options at a strike price of 93.25 to 93.30 in the last two sessions , while a French firm bought 4,000 September 93.30 to 93.32 put spreads . \" Even before the data came out , we were seeing put buying , \" one floor trader said . Meanwhile , funds were reportedly good sellers of five-year notes . Rumors circulated that the Federal Reserve was buying five-year notes , and that a renowned hedge fund manager was buying 10-year notes in the cash markets . However , December T-bonds ended below a major trendline level at 106-26/32 , as the yield in the cash bond market set its highest monthly close since April 1995 at 7.12 percent , one analyst said . December bonds blew through the July 30 low of 107-06/32 , even though conditions were slightly oversold , traders said . The December calendar spread continued to widen , also reflecting the market 's fear of rising inflation . While the market continues to price-in higher U.S. interest rates , there was little conviction to the theory that the Federal Reserve would tighten rates before the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on September 24 . Federal Reserve governor Lawrence Lindsey , speaking on U.S. cable television network CNBC , said the U.S. economy appears on balance to be a bit strong , adding the central bank would not curb growth provided inflation remains in check . Earlier in the day , Fed chairman Alan Greenspan said at the annual Jackson Hole symposium that the goal of price stability is within reach for major nations .

Magna was up 1/8 to 48-1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange . Douglas & Lomason has 4.45 million common shares outstanding , some of which are option shares to be purchased at exercise prices less than the $ 31 offered price .

Ford plans to cut its roster of 2,300 tier-one suppliers -- those it deals with directly -- in half over the next five years . \" The deal really levels the seating field somewhat , \" said John Casesa of Schroder Wertheim & Co . \" It should give Magna the critical mass to be a bigger player in that market . \" Magna 's traditional strength has been instrument panels , door panels and other interior components .

Professor David McLeod , who examined Bruno , told the Sun : \" There is a risk he could be blinded in the eye if he steps into the ring again . He is in danger of getting a retinal detachment and there is no point in exposing himself to that . \" Bruno lost three world title fights before finally landing the crown by beating American Oliver McCall in a unanimous points decision at Wembley in September 1995 .

The commander-in-chief of Tajikistan 's armed forces , Major-General Nikolai Sherbatov , took a group of journalists by helicopter to the remote , and now devastated , town to show that his forces held it . He said his troops took Tavildara without casualties on August 23 , but the crack of sniper and machinegun fire revealed the presence of opposition fighters in the surrounding mountains . Sherbatov said the rebels were located about three km ( two miles ) east of Tavildara around the village of Layron . Tavildara , 200 km ( 120 miles ) east of the capital Dushanbe , was in ruins . Shells had smashed roofs and windows and empty shell cases littered the streets . The town straddles a strategically important road linking government and rebel-held territory and has fallen succesively to both sides in a bloody tug-of-war which began last February . Tajikistan , which borders Afghanistan and China , has been split by a dragging four-year conflict after a civil war between communists and a frail coalition of Islamic and liberal groups . Tens of thousands of people have been killed and many more have been displaced in the fighting , which breached a shaky United Nations-sponsored ceasefire .

They say the politicians will need to promote legislation that helps the economy without scaring the socks off financial markets . \" The worst thing that could happen for financial markets is that if Clinton and Dole start to trade shots in the middle of the ring with one-upmanship , \" said Hugh Johnson , chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. \" That 's when Wall Street will need to worry . \" He said that the bond market would be the first to react if the \" bidding \" intensifies and stocks would quickly drop as interest rates rise . \" I do n't think it would imply the collapse of the stock market , unless the rise in rates touches off a dynamic within the market , which would include selling by portfolio managers , redemptions by individuals of mutual funds that would , in turn , pressure the portfolio managers to sell even more stock . \" This week , the market weighed Dole 's proposal to lower federal income taxes by 15 percent across the board , a package that carries a price tag of $ 548 billion . Clinton proposes an $ 8.4 billion re-election agenda that would spare most home-sellers from capital gains taxes and give employers tax incentives to hire people off the welfare rolls . Clinton claims Dole 's plan would increase the deficit , while the White House said some corporate taxes would be raised to offset the cost of the president 's plan . The experts said there are some unusual risks for the market from this year 's political season because the rush to promise tax cuts to win votes could upset Wall Street 's expectations that Washington will balance the budget . \" The stock market will have to edit the promises and then do a probability study on those edited promises , \" said John Geraghty at the consulting firm North American Equity Services . During the past four presidential elections , the candidate that has favoured tax cuts has won . Ronald Reagan 's tax cut won him a second four-year term in the White House in 1984 , while Democrat Walter Mondale , who promised higher taxes , lost . George Bush became president in 1988 on his no-new-tax campaign and Clinton won in 1992 with a promise to fatten workers ' paychecks . The trick , they said , will be for the candidates to continue to convince Wall Street that the Treasury 's 30-year bond -- the most closely-watched interest rate -- will fall to between 4 percent and 5 percent by the end of the decade . Johnson said that long-term interest rates have already been spooked by the election . The long-term bond jumped this week to 7.13 percent after starting the year at 5.95 percent . The surge of buying in stocks during the last two years has come amid an environment of low interest rates , which has boosted corporate profits . But the market stalled this summer after the Dow Jones industrial average set a record high of 5,778.00 points on May 22 . \" The market does n't seem to be able to make new highs and it has been back and forth in a fairly horizontal mode which looks like a holding pattern , \" said Geraghty . He said the market reflects the political uncertainty , now that Dole has sharply narrowed the gap with Clinton in the polls . Geraghty said that the one thing that could completely turn the election around are new findings in the Whitewater scandal that would damage the Clintons . \" Stocks are on a delicate edge because if something happens that looks like it could upset the presidency , it could throw the political and , to some extent the economic , process into chaos , \" Geraghty said . Right now , Wall Street is pondering the candidates . \" We have an election where there are so many unknown variables that most people will probably want to hold fire , and even take the chance that they will have to pay higher prices for stocks after the November election , than take the risk that a shock to the system will hurt the stock market , \" Geraghty said . On Friday , the Dow Jones index closed down 31.44 points at 5,616.21 . For the week , it was down 106.53 points . The Nasdaq composite index closed 3.53 points lower Friday at 1,141.50 .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "Brisk economic reports rattle markets anew . Glenn Somerville WASHINGTON 1996-08-30 Factory orders rose in July and manufacturing surged in the Midwest in August , reports said Friday , sparking worries about inflation that battered financial markets for a second straight day . The Commerce Department said orders for manufactured goods climbed 1.8 percent in July to a seasonally adjusted $ 317.6 billion -- nearly twice the increase that had been expected . Shipments of everything from new cars to food items rose , as did order backlogs , in a sign that the strength in the industrial sector would continue in coming months . A separate report from Chicago area purchasing managers underlined the strength in manufacturing as the group 's barometer of manufacturing in the region jumped to 60 in August from 51.2 in July . A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing . While production and orders rose at Midwest area businesses , the prices they paid for goods used in manufacturing remained well in check . Analysts said the reports implied the economy was not slowing down in the third quarter after a burst of growth in the spring , and that the lull in late June and July was more temporary than Federal Reserve policy-makers had wanted . \" It appears that August is showing an economy again reversing course and is not moving onto a significantly slower track at this point , \" said economist Lynn Reaser of Barnett Banks Inc. in Jacksonville , Fla . The reports fanned worries on Wall Street that the Fed , the nation 's central bank , would raise rates next month in a bid to ward off inflation , driving stock and bond prices sharply lower for a second day running . The 30-year Treasury fell almost a point , raising its yield , which moves in the opposite direction from the price , to 7.12 percent from 7.04 percent late Thursday . The Dow Jones industrial average fell 31.44 points to 5,616.21 after a 64.73-point decline Thursday . A third report from the Commerce Department , on July personal income and spending , pointed to a potential slowdown in consumer spending that some analysts said may help moderate growth in the second half . It showed spending rose only 0.2 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 5.15 trillion after dropping a revised 0.4 percent in June . Incomes from wages , salaries and all other sources gained 0.1 percent to a rate of $ 6.47 trillion after a 0.9 percent jump in June . July 's slight gain in incomes was the weakest in six months , since January when they were flat . Economist Joel Naroff of First Union bank in Philadelphia said consumer spending , which fuels two-thirds of the nation 's economy , may be much slower in the third quarter than in the first half , which should slow economic growth . \" The FOMC ( Federal Open Market Committee ) has been forecasting a slowing in economic activity and moderating household demand will have a large impact on overall economic growth , \" Naroff said in a written comment . The policy-making FOMC is to meet on Sept . 24 to plot interest-rate strategy . It already has adopted a bias toward raising rates to keep a lid on wage and price rises and help sustain the 5-1 / 2-year-old economic expansion . In an interview on the cable television network CNBC Friday , Federal Reserve Governor Lawrence Lindsey said there still were \" mixed signals \" about the economy 's direction . \" I think that , on balance , it is looking a little bit on the strong side , \" Lindsey said . He added that with expansion as solid as it is and with unemployment so low \" the greater risks are clearly that we might see some overheating . \" While July consumer spending rose only slightly , there were ample indications that consumers remained confident . The University of Michigan 's August index of consumer sentiment , made available on Friday to paying subscribers , rose to 95.3 from 94.7 in July . Reaser said strong consumer confidence coupled with relatively lean inventories were providing manufacturers with a reason to gear up production . \" The economy is not going to be expanding at the 4.8 percent ( annual ) rate that we had in the second quarter but it is likely to keep expanding in the 3 percent range , \" she said , above the 2 percent to 2-1/4 percent that the Fed considers to be non-inflationary . New orders to factories were strong for durable goods like new cars and for nondurables like paper and food products . Orders for durable goods , meant to last three years or more , rose a revised 1.7 percent in July after falling 0.2 percent in June . Orders for nondurables jumped 1.8 percent following a 1.2 percent decrease in June .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 4676], "labels": [[[45, 61], "Unknown"], [[62, 72], "Q61"], [[144, 151], "Q186545"], [[283, 302], "Q503577"], [[654, 661], "Q1297"], [[919, 926], "Q186545"], [[1215, 1230], "Q53536"], [[1413, 1424], "Unknown"], [[1428, 1446], "Unknown"], [[1450, 1462], "Q16568"], [[1465, 1468], "Unknown"], [[1501, 1512], "Q13677"], [[1522, 1525], "Q53536"], [[1702, 1710], "Q648666"], [[1862, 1871], "Q180816"], [[1984, 2003], "Q503577"], [[2567, 2578], "Unknown"], [[2582, 2593], "Unknown"], [[2602, 2614], "Q1345"], [[2797, 2801], "Q2289022"], [[2804, 2833], "Q2289022"], [[2976, 2982], "Unknown"], [[3029, 3033], "Q2289022"], [[3287, 3291], "Q1023912"], [[3301, 3316], "Q53536"], [[3326, 3342], "Q6503830"], [[3496, 3503], "Q6503830"], [[3777, 3799], "Q230492"], [[3922, 3928], "Unknown"], [[4300, 4303], "Q53536"]]}
{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "Mexican avocados not expected in U.S . Maggie McNeil WASHINGTON 1996-08-30 U.S. Agriculture Department officials said Friday that Mexican avocados -- which are restricted from entering the continental United States -- will not likely be entering U.S. markets any time soon , even if the controversial ban were lifted today . \" The opportunity to import ( Mexican avocados ) probably wo n't become possible for another year , \" said Paul Drazek , senior trade advisor to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman . \" We could lift the ban tomorrow , but that would not mean anything immediately , \" said Drazek . \" We probably would not see avacados come in until next season , next November . \" The Agriculture Department proposed more than a year ago to significantly ease an 82-year ban on Mexican avocados . Under the administration 's proposal , the borders to the Mexican produce would be opened into 19 Northern and Northeastern states from November through February . The plan has raised a storm of protest from U.S. avocado growers , who are largely concentrated in California . California growers have charged that removing the restrictions , even on a limited basis , would endanger the $ 1 billion U.S. industry if potentially harmful Mexican insects were brought into the country along with the avocados . Mexican officials contend that there is no scientific basis for the ban , and that it is illegal under international trading rules of the World Trade Organisation . Proponents of the plan discount the worries of the U.S. growers and say the plan has enough safeguards built into it to eliminate any significant threat to American producers . Under the proposal , only imports of export-quality avocados growing in approved orchards in Michoacan , Mexico , the country 's main avocado area , would be allowed . Mexican growers and distributors would have to abide by strict rules established by the Mexican and U.S. agriculture agencies . The California Avocado Commission -- which has spearheaded the opposition to lifting the ban -- said new data the group submitted to the Agriculture Department last spring shows the department underestimated the pest problem in Mexico and have urged that the agency reopen its study of the issue . The administration is still studying the new data , and officials have said that if experts think the information is significant , the agency could reopen its investigation . But U.S. avocado industry sources said that while they may have delayed the plan for a while , they ultimately do not expect the administration to change its position . \" From a common-sense view , the department should reconsider this plan , but due to politics they will probably go ahead with this , \" said Tom Bellamore of the California avocado group . Administration officials said they want to get the issue resolved as quickly as possible , but said there is no timetable they are working under . \" It 's a very complicated issue , \" said the Agriculture Department 's Drazek . \" We 'll get it resolved as quickly as we can , based on the best available science . \"", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 3095], "labels": [[[0, 7], "Q96"], [[33, 36], "Q30"], [[39, 52], "Unknown"], [[53, 63], "Q61"], [[75, 102], "Q501542"], [[130, 137], "Q96"], [[201, 214], "Q30"], [[246, 250], "Q30"], [[355, 362], "Q96"], [[432, 443], "Unknown"], [[492, 504], "Q370213"], [[596, 602], "Unknown"], [[692, 714], "Q501542"], [[785, 792], "Q96"], [[862, 869], "Q96"], [[1012, 1016], "Q30"], [[1067, 1077], "Q99"], [[1080, 1090], "Q99"], [[1202, 1206], "Q30"], [[1239, 1246], "Q96"], [[1311, 1318], "Q96"], [[1449, 1473], "Q7825"], [[1527, 1531], "Q30"], [[1632, 1640], "Q30"], [[1746, 1755], "Q79861"], [[1758, 1764], "Q96"], [[1821, 1828], "Q96"], [[1909, 1916], "Q96"], [[1921, 1925], "Q30"], [[1953, 1982], "Unknown"], [[2086, 2108], "Q501542"], [[2177, 2183], "Q96"], [[2426, 2430], "Q30"], [[2732, 2745], "Unknown"], [[2753, 2763], "Q99"], [[2973, 2995], "Q501542"], [[2999, 3005], "Unknown"]]}
{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "U.S. Cardinal Bernardin says has terminal cancer . CHICAGO 1996-08-30 Chicago Cardinal Joseph Bernardin , head of the second-largest U.S. Roman Catholic archdiocese , said on Friday his doctors had diagnosed him as having liver cancer and he had a year or less to live . Bernardin , 68 , underwent extensive surgery for pancreatic cancer in June 1995 followed by months of chemotherapy , which he said made him more aware of his own vulnerabilities and the need to minister to the sick . \" On Wednesday , examinations indicated that the cancer has returned , this time in the liver . I am told that it is terminal and that my life expectancy is one year or less , \" a composed Bernardin told a news conference . In 14 years as Chicago 's archbishop , he built a prayerful , saintly image and was deeply involved in world church issues and publicly committed to rooting out abuses by clergy . \" I have been assured that I still have some quality time left , \" he said , saying he would undergo a new form of chemotherapy but his doctors have told him there was only a slim chance of a cure and the liver cancer was inoperable . \" It 's not going to be easy to say goodbye to everybody . Death does have some sad dimensions to it but I am a man of faith , \" he said . \" Death is a natural phenomenom . \" He said he would \" serve until the end \" as cardinal . Pancreatic cancer is among the most deadly forms of the disease , although Bernardin 's case was caught early . Surgeons removed a cancerous kidney , parts of his pancreas and stomach , small intestine , bile duct and surrounding tissues . He made a rapid recovery and resumed most of his duties , but then developed a deteriorating condition in his spine that caused him great pain and shortened his height by several inches . He was scheduled to undergo back surgery next month , but that was cancelled when the cancer was discovered in his liver in order to avoid delaying the start of chemotherapy . The spare , soft-spoken son of an Italian stonecutter took over the Chicago archdiocese , the nation 's second-largest after Los Angeles , with 2.3 million parishioners , in 1982 . Ironically , Bernardin , who developed a progressive , much-praised programme to deal with pedophilia involving priests , became the highest-ranking church official ever accused of sexual improprieties when a former seminary student leveled charges in 1993 that he had been sexually abused by Bernardin during the 1970s . Bernardin steadfastly denied the charges and the former student later recanted his tale of abuse . Bernardin prayed with him before he died from AIDS last year . Bernardin , who became archbishop of Cincinnati in 1972 , played an increasingly prominent role in the U.S. church as a moderate voice of compromise among liberals and conservatives in the ranks of the bishops . This month , he announced that he would oversee a series of conferences to find \" common ground \" among American Catholics . Previously , he was instrumental in drafting church policy on war , peace and nuclear arms , and for seven years he headed the bishops ' anti-abortion policy committee , espousing a policy describing human life as a \" seamless garment . \"", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 3201], "labels": [[[0, 4], "Q30"], [[14, 23], "Q744108"], [[51, 58], "Q1297"], [[70, 77], "Q1297"], [[87, 103], "Q744108"], [[133, 137], "Q30"], [[138, 152], "Q9592"], [[271, 280], "Q744108"], [[677, 686], "Q744108"], [[727, 734], "Q1297"], [[1432, 1441], "Q744108"], [[1995, 2002], "Q38"], [[2029, 2036], "Q1297"], [[2086, 2097], "Q65"], [[2155, 2164], "Q744108"], [[2435, 2444], "Q744108"], [[2464, 2473], "Q744108"], [[2563, 2572], "Q744108"], [[2609, 2613], "Q12199"], [[2626, 2635], "Q744108"], [[2663, 2673], "Q43196"], [[2729, 2733], "Q30"], [[2942, 2960], "Unknown"]]}

Brad Dorfman CHICAGO 1996-08-30 The $ 9.5 billion proposed acquisition of Boatmen 's Bancshares Inc. by NationsBank Corp. could spark a flurry of other mergers involving Missouri banks , which until last year were protected from outside buyers by state regulations . \" NationsBank just strolled into the Midwest and bagged the biggest banking trophy in the landscape , \" said Michael Ancell , banking industry analyst at Edward D. Jones & Co . \" Whoever wants a big market position in the Midwest has to come in and grab Mercantile or Commerce . \" St. Louis-based Mercantile Bancorp Inc. , a bank holding company with $ 18.04 billion in assets , was seen by many analysts as the most attractive Missouri franchise in size after Boatmen 's . Kansas City , Mo.-based Commerce Bancshares Inc. , with $ 9.32 billion in assets , also could help a regional bank establish a strong presence in the lower Midwest , analysts added . \" It focuses more attention on Mercantile , Commerce and Roosevelt , \" said James Weber , analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons . Roosevelt Financial Group Inc is a $ 9.33 billion asset-St . Louis based thrift . \" Now ... the most coveted bank out there is Mercantile , \" Weber said .

Representatives of First Bank , Norwest , Banc One and First Chicago said the banks do not comment on rumors of possible mergers or acquisitions . KeyCorp , contacted by phone , would not comment .

Talk that the Missouri banks were seeking inflated prices from buyers was seen as a reason a deal has not occurred sooner . But NationsBank 's bid , representing a premium of 40 percent for Boatmen 's stock , was large enough to get the deal done . \" I think Boatmen 's was shopping itself , and everybody knew if you wanted to be the winning buyer here , you had to make the bid nobody would beat , \" Ancell said . But some analysts cautioned that other targets should not expect as large a premium . They also questioned whether NationsBank can recoup shareholder value with such a large bid for Boatmen 's . \" I think initially some stocks will trade up on sympathy , but the wild premium NationsBank put on this deal here , I do n't see a lot of other deals being done at this premium , \" said Michael Durante , analyst at McDonald & Co .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 2851], "labels": [[[0, 10], "Unknown"], [[43, 55], "Unknown"], [[56, 63], "Q1297"], [[117, 143], "Unknown"], [[147, 164], "Q3337010"], [[213, 221], "Q1581"], [[312, 323], "Q3337010"], [[347, 354], "Q186545"], [[419, 433], "Unknown"], [[464, 484], "Unknown"], [[532, 539], "Q186545"], [[564, 574], "Unknown"], [[578, 586], "Unknown"], [[591, 606], "Unknown"], [[607, 630], "Unknown"], [[738, 746], "Q1581"], [[771, 781], "Unknown"], [[784, 795], "Q41819"], [[798, 807], "Unknown"], [[808, 832], "Q5152411"], [[940, 947], "Q186545"], [[998, 1008], "Unknown"], [[1011, 1019], "Unknown"], [[1024, 1033], "Unknown"], [[1043, 1054], "Unknown"], [[1068, 1087], "Q4647781"], [[1090, 1119], "Unknown"], [[1140, 1156], "Unknown"], [[1217, 1227], "Unknown"], [[1232, 1237], "Unknown"], [[1245, 1255], "Unknown"], [[1260, 1268], "Unknown"], [[1366, 1374], "Q1581"], [[1379, 1396], "Unknown"], [[1397, 1419], "Unknown"], [[1424, 1437], "Unknown"], [[1440, 1450], "Unknown"], [[1451, 1458], "Unknown"], [[1463, 1477], "Unknown"], [[1484, 1507], "Unknown"], [[1511, 1519], "Q1204"], [[1541, 1551], "Unknown"], [[1554, 1561], "Q7061445"], [[1564, 1572], "Q2882621"], [[1577, 1590], "Q5452612"], [[1669, 1676], "Q1740314"], [[1780, 1790], "Unknown"], [[1808, 1816], "Q1581"], [[1916, 1926], "Unknown"], [[1943, 1951], "Q1581"], [[1984, 1991], "Q186545"], [[1996, 2001], "Unknown"], [[2023, 2031], "Q1581"], [[2137, 2148], "Q3337010"], [[2199, 2209], "Unknown"], [[2268, 2278], "Unknown"], [[2411, 2417], "Unknown"], [[2540, 2551], "Q3337010"], [[2607, 2617], "Unknown"], [[2701, 2712], "Q3337010"], [[2807, 2822], "Unknown"], [[2836, 2849], "Unknown"]]}

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "Consumer spending , incomes edge up in July . Glenn Somerville WASHINGTON 1996-08-30 Consumer spending barely edged up in July , the Commerce Department said Friday , as income growth slowed abruptly to the weakest pace in six months . Spending rose 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 5.15 trillion after dropping a revised 0.4 percent in June . Incomes from wages , salaries and all other sources gained 0.1 percent to a rate of $ 6.47 trillion after a 0.9 percent jump in June . Department officials said July 's slight gain in incomes was the weakest for any month since January , when they were flat . Wages and salaries came under pressure in July as a shorter average workweek and lower hourly earnings cut into paychecks . The department said wages and salaries decreased by $ 6.9 billion in July after climbing $ 45 billion in June . \" In July , average weekly hours and average hourly earnings declined , more than offsetting the effect of an increase in employment , \" Commerce said . But more money went into savings accounts , as savings held at 5.3 cents out of each dollar earned in both June and July . That was the highest savings rate since October last year , when 5.5 cents out of each dollar earned was being saved . The generally lackluster report on spending and incomes in July had been expected . At the same time , the department said in a separate report that new orders received by U.S. factories climbed strongly in July , with widespread gains across most major categories . Orders increased 1.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 317.6 billion , significantly stronger than the 1 percent rise forecast by Wall Street economists . That followed a revised 0.7 percent decline in June orders . Commerce said previously that spending at retail stores was up only 0.1 percent in July , partly because of softer sales of new cars and light trucks . In addition , the Labour Department 's July employment report had foreshadowed the muted income growth . It showed average hourly earnings fell in July by 0.2 percent to $ 11.00 and the average workweek shortened to 34.3 hours from 34.7 in June . Gains in personal income , which includes wages and salaries as well as income from sources such as dividends , interest and businesses , are essential for funding consumer purchases , which fuel two-thirds of national economic activity . Spending on all types of durable goods , which includes cars , fell to an annual rate of $ 626.3 billion in July from $ 633.6 billion in June . But spending on nondurable products increased moderately to a rate of $ 1.55 trillion from $ 1.54 trillion in June , while spending for services was up to $ 2.97 trillion in July from $ 2.96 trillion . Payrolls of manufacturing companies rose in July by $ 2.3 billion to an annual rate of $ 678 billion .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 2826], "labels": [[[46, 62], "Unknown"], [[63, 73], "Q61"], [[133, 152], "Q503577"], [[998, 1006], "Q503577"], [[1428, 1432], "Q30"], [[1654, 1665], "Q13677"], [[1910, 1927], "Unknown"]]}

In another report , sales of new homes jumped unexpectedly in July to the briskest rate in five months , driving prices up in a strong housing market . Sales shot up 7.9 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 783,000 units -- the strongest since February , when new homes were selling at a rate of 784,000 a year . Analysts said the stock market was also worried about the impact on President Clinton 's re-election bid of his top political strategist resigning . Dick Morris , who is credited with resurrecting Clinton 's political fortunes over the past 18 months by masterminding his turn to the political centre , quit after a supermarket tabloid reported he engaged in a yearlong affair with a prostitute , with whom he allegedly shared confidential campaign documents . Analysts said Wall Street had grown accustomed to a moderate Republican in the form of Democratic President Clinton . Morris ' departure raised fears that Clinton would veer more to the left in a second term . The dollar closed at 1.4772 marks , up from 1.4767 late Wednesday .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "Pirelli cables look to tap Chinese growth . David Jones MILAN 1996-08-30 Italian tyre and cables giant Pirelli on Friday announced its long-awaited move into China with a cables joint venture set to capitalise on the rapidly-growing Chinese telecommunications market . Pirelli is linking with Hong Kong-based group CITIC Pacific in a venture to be called the Wuxi Tong Ling Company Ltd , which will operate in partnership with a local industrial company at its existing factory in Wuxi , Jiangsu province , Shanghai . The partners will invest around $ 30 million in the existing copper cable plant at Wuxi to update technology and include optic fibre production , with annual turnover expected to reach $ 60 million within the next few years . The move marks a further move by Pirelli 's cables division to expand in the fast-growing Far Eastern developing markets with the group already present in Indonesia , India and Malaysia . \" This is really positive news for Pirelli , and I expect that it will produce one of the best half-year results in late September compared to other industrial Italian companies , \" said analyst Paula Buratti at Indosuez . She emphasised that the move was positive because Pirelli will have management control of the Chinese venture , and it also showed another example of Pirelli exporting its technical know-how to developing markets . Pirelli shares reacted favourable even though talks had been underway for some time and news about a venture had been widely expected . The shares rose 0.2 percent to 2,555 lire by 1350 GMT in an easier Milan stock market . This will be Pirelli 's first industrial involvement in a Chinese market where demand for telecommunication networks is expected to grow to 80-100 million new lines between 1996 and 2000 , doubling demand for optical cables . China 's second largest telecoms operator Unicom already has a mandate from the central government to establish 15 million new phone lines by the year 2000 , which will necessitate new trunk line systems and local distribution networks . \" The starting of this production base in China has for our group an undoubted strategic value , representing an important enhancement of our presence in Asia , \" said Pirelli SpA chairman and chief executive officer Marco Tonchetti Provera . Pirelli Cables has global sales of over $ 3.5 billion , and has become a large supplier of optic cables and systems to major telecoms carriers in the U.S. , Europe and the Far East . CITIC Pacific is a major Hong Kong-listed company focusing on infrastruture , trading , distribution and property , with 28 percent of its 1995 profits coming from telecoms .

Cotti said Chechnya must remain part of Russia , but the solution to the conflict would be to accord the region maximum autonomy within Russia 's borders . \" There is no doubt that Chechnya , according to OSCE principles , belongs to a state called Russia , \" he said , pointing out that Russia was an OSCE member and it was not the organisation 's policy to challenge members ' sovereignty . He added that the OSCE was the only international body which has been allowed into the Chechnya to monitor the human rights situation there , but that its means were restricted by the fact that the conflict was a \" internal issue \" . \" We have a small concept , the details of which have yet to be worked out . Chechnya must be accorded the maximum autonomy possible within the framework of Russian integrity , \" said Cotti .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 1933], "labels": [[[0, 4], "Unknown"], [[25, 33], "Q5187"], [[50, 54], "Q586"], [[202, 210], "Q5187"], [[277, 289], "Q118199"], [[312, 363], "Unknown"], [[366, 370], "Unknown"], [[380, 386], "Q183"], [[397, 409], "Unknown"], [[438, 446], "Q5187"], [[462, 469], "Q159"], [[486, 490], "Unknown"], [[549, 553], "Unknown"], [[617, 622], "Q39"], [[659, 667], "Q5187"], [[721, 731], "Unknown"], [[743, 751], "Q5187"], [[768, 781], "Unknown"], [[788, 793], "Q39"], [[817, 821], "Unknown"], [[822, 830], "Q5187"], [[869, 890], "Q313449"], [[948, 955], "Q159"], [[967, 982], "Q295898"], [[987, 994], "Q5187"], [[1022, 1037], "Q193354"], [[1115, 1120], "Q118199"], [[1126, 1134], "Q5187"], [[1155, 1161], "Q159"], [[1251, 1257], "Q159"], [[1296, 1304], "Q5187"], [[1320, 1324], "Unknown"], [[1364, 1370], "Q159"], [[1403, 1409], "Q159"], [[1417, 1421], "Unknown"], [[1526, 1530], "Unknown"], [[1595, 1603], "Q5187"], [[1819, 1827], "Q5187"], [[1899, 1906], "Q159"], [[1926, 1931], "Q118199"]]}

The source , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said Azerbaijani presidential adviser Vafa Gulizade and his Armenian counterpart Zhirayr Liparityan met to discuss the disputed enclave on Wednesday and had now flown home . An uneasy ceasefire has prevailed in Nagorno-Karabakh , which represents around 20 percent of Azeri territory , since May 1994 after ethnic Armenians drove Azeris out of the region .

Rolf Soderlind LONGYEAR , Norway 1996-08-30 The windblown , chilly streets of this tiny Arctic town are all but deserted and flags are flying at half-mast beneath a brooding , clouded sky . Longyear is a town in mourning , a close-knit community that has been shattered . Disaster struck on Thursday when a Russian airliner bringing coal miners to work crashed as it came in to land at the airport , killing all 141 people on board . \" It 's a sight I will never forget . I will remember it for the rest of my life , \" said Stig Onarheim . He was one of a handful of rescuers who raced to the scene of the crash in a helicopter on Thursday , hoping in vain to find survivors . The plane smashed into a snow-capped mountain on the Arctic island of Spitzbergen on Thursday , just east of Longyear . \" Imagine a big plane with a lot of luggage and people on board . Think of all that mixed together , with twisted , wrecked parts on the slope , \" Onarheim , 29 , told Reuters . Police and local officials have sealed off the crash site , protecting it from intrusive reporters and from the polar bears that roam freely across the icy expanses . The dead were all Russians and Ukrainians , coming to work in the mining towns of Barentsburg and Pyramiden . Longyear is a Norwegian settlement of just over 1,000 people , but it also feels the loss keenly . \" I have trouble finding the words to express my grief . It 's a tragedy for everyone . We know many of the people who live in Barentsburg , some of them could have been on the plane , \" said Johan Sletten , 52 . Sletten , a caretaker who has lived on the island for 30 years , said the Norwegian and Russian communities visit frequently , competing at soccer in the summer and with snow-scooter races in the winter . Teenage shop assistant Heidi Groenstein was blunter . \" I 'm glad it was not a Norwegian plane , \" she said . \" Just think of it -- a mining village where so many workers die . They must be having a tough time of it now . \" Barentsburg , just a few hours ride by snow-scooter or 15 minutes by helicopter from Longyear , has asked to be left alone with its grief and told reporters to stay away . Around 100 Russian and Ukrainian miners were waiting in Longyear to fly home on the plane that crashed . They were given shelter in the town 's church overnight and ate a sombre breakfast before getting on a bus for the airport . Another plane had been sent from Moscow to pick them up . At this time of year , the only colour in Longyear comes from the brightly-painted wooden houses . Everything else is muddy , the waters of the fjord leaden . Winter is in the air . Barentsburg is an even grimmer place , a run-down testament to the hardships of the new Russia . Spitzbergen lies some 500 miles ( 800 km ) off the northern tip of Norway and endures one of the most extreme climates on the planet . Inhabited by fewer than 3,000 people in total , it sees the sun for 24 hours a day during summer and is plunged into round-the-clock darkness in the winter months . The terrain is mountainous , the only roads are dirt tracks . Norway rules the island group under the terms of a 1920s international treaty which gave many other nations the right to establish setttlements and exploit the coal that is still mined there .

On Tuesday , Israeli crews hoisted a bulldozer over the walls of Jerusalem 's old city and demolished the centre , saying it was being restored without a building permit . Canada had recently donated $ 30 million to the centre , called the Burj al-Laqlaq Society .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 1748], "labels": [[[0, 12], "Unknown"], [[29, 36], "Q801"], [[50, 64], "Q1065"], [[76, 92], "Q37470"], [[136, 142], "Q801"], [[162, 173], "Q219060"], [[232, 243], "Q7204"], [[296, 307], "Q219060"], [[308, 312], "Q1065"], [[332, 348], "Q37470"], [[359, 369], "Unknown"], [[373, 380], "Q183"], [[434, 440], "Q801"], [[464, 475], "Q5238486"], [[656, 661], "Unknown"], [[734, 741], "Q801"], [[811, 822], "Q219060"], [[835, 848], "Unknown"], [[877, 886], "Q1218"], [[911, 917], "Q801"], [[987, 1009], "Unknown"], [[1044, 1050], "Q801"], [[1059, 1094], "Unknown"], [[1213, 1220], "Q801"], [[1254, 1262], "Q213274"], [[1393, 1397], "Q1065"], [[1429, 1436], "Q801"], [[1497, 1504], "Q801"], [[1549, 1558], "Q1218"], [[1656, 1662], "Q16"], [[1724, 1746], "Unknown"]]}

LA CORUNA , Spain 1996-08-31 A late goal by newly-signed defender Roberto Carlos saved the blushes of Real Madrid coach Fabio Capello and his multi-billion peseta line-up in the opening game of the Spanish championship on Saturday . The Brazilian 's 79th-minute effort was enough to earn Real a point from a scrappy 1-1 draw at fellow title contenders Deportivo Coruna . Deportivo started strongly , taking the lead midway through the first half when former Auxerre playmaker Corentine Martins headed home a corner after a flick-on by Brazilian-born Spanish international midfielder Donato . Real looked to be in deep trouble shortly after the break when Luis Milla was sent off for committing two bookable offences in as many minutes . But Deportivo were unable to capitalise on their numerical advantage , and were themselves reduced to ten men when Armando Alvarez was sent off 15 minutes from time . Shortly afterwards Roberto Carlos found space in the home defence and equalised for Real with a shot that was deflected past despairing Deportivo ' keeper Jacques Songo'o . In a frantic final five minutes there were chances at both ends , and Donato , who had earlier been booked , was sent off for protesting about the incursion of Real players at a free kick . Before the match Deportivo chairman Augusto Lendoiro said he would ignore a FIFA decision banning Brazilian midfielder Mauro Silva from playing in the match for failing to join his national side 's tour of Europe . In the event , coach John Toshack decided not to use Silva , who had claimed he did not join the Brazil squad because he had lost his passport .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 1683], "labels": [[[9, 13], "Q8682"], [[57, 66], "Q8757"], [[69, 74], "Q29"], [[123, 137], "Q429039"], [[159, 170], "Q8682"], [[177, 190], "Q183108"], [[255, 262], "Q29"], [[294, 303], "Q155"], [[345, 349], "Q8682"], [[409, 425], "Unknown"], [[428, 437], "Q8760"], [[515, 522], "Q182876"], [[533, 550], "Unknown"], [[592, 606], "Q155"], [[607, 614], "Q29"], [[640, 646], "Q2176725"], [[649, 653], "Q8682"], [[712, 722], "Q510631"], [[798, 807], "Q8760"], [[909, 924], "Unknown"], [[980, 994], "Q429039"], [[1045, 1049], "Q8682"], [[1097, 1106], "Q8760"], [[1116, 1131], "Unknown"], [[1204, 1210], "Q2176725"], [[1294, 1298], "Q8682"], [[1341, 1350], "Q8760"], [[1360, 1376], "Unknown"], [[1400, 1404], "Q253414"], [[1422, 1431], "Q155"], [[1443, 1454], "Q342457"], [[1530, 1536], "Q46"], [[1560, 1572], "Q342989"], [[1592, 1597], "Unknown"], [[1636, 1642], "Q83459"]]}

The Indians had their four-game winning streak stopped . \" It 's not something I 'm going to try to explain , \" said Texas manager Johnny Oates about his team winning seven of the 10 meetings from Cleveland this season . \" We 've got two more regular season games against them and we might get lucky enough or unlucky enough to play them in the post-season . \" Roger Pavlik ( 15-7 ) gave up three runs and seven hits in 6 1/3 innings and became the fourth 15-game winner in the American League .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "RUGBY UNION - SPRINGBOKS FINALLY BREAK ALL BLACK SPELL . Andy Colquhoun JOHANNESBURG 1996-08-31 South Africa managed to avoid a fifth successive defeat in 1996 at the hands of the All Blacks with an emphatic 32-22 victory in front of an ecstatic Ellis Park crowd on Saturday . They scored three tries in recording their highest total against New Zealand , salvaging some pride in a season in which the world champions have lost five out of eight tests . It also ended a run of nine successive victories this year for New Zealand but arrived too late to prevent a 2-1 series defeat and an historic first All Black series triumph on South African soil . Springbok scrum-half Joost van der Westhuizen was his side 's inspiration , scoring their opening try and making the third for flanker Andre Venter from a quickly taken penalty to give his side a 29-8 lead after 54 minutes . Fullback Andre Joubert scored the other , scorching in from 40 metres at the start of the second half to add to his three long-range penalties . The All Blacks salvaged some pride by scoring two tries from centre Walter Little and scrum-half Justin Marshall in the final five minutes to close a gap which at one point stood at 24 points . But they generally endured an off-day , highlighted by recalled fly-half Andrew Mehrtens who missed five out of eight kicks at goal . Recalled fly-half Henry Honiball kicked the Springboks into a 6-0 lead after 10 minutes only to see Andrew Mehrtens launch a penalty from eight metres inside his own half to narrow the gap . Mehrtens missed three further penalties and a conversion in the first 40 minutes which could have put his side ahead , but it was the Springboks who looked the more dangerous . Their promise was realised when Joubert made a 40-metre break in the 25th minute and , although winger Pieter Hendriks appeared to knock on Joubert 's reverse pass , Welsh referee Derek Bevan allowed Van der Westhuizen to pick up and score under the posts . Honiball converted and Joubert kicked a penalty before All Black hooker Sean Fitzpatrick scored a try from close range on the stroke of half-time to narrow the lead to 16-8 and hint at a comeback . Instead Joubert kicked another long penalty and then raced around the outside of the defence to score the Springboks ' second try . A quick penalty from Van der Westhuizen five metres from the All Black line set up the third try for Venter five minutes later and when Joubert kicked his third penalty the Springboks held an unassailable 32-8 lead going into the last quarter . When the All Blacks did break through , it was too late . Centre Walter Little followed up Mehrtens ' kick to score under the posts and scrum-half Justin Marshall forced himself over from a ruck close to the line in injury-time to give them some consolation .

The match boiled over when Hill made to walk off court after what he claimed was a game-winning point in the third . When the referee called Jansher 's return good and the decision was accepted by the player , Hill shrieked at the Pakistani : \" You cheat . \" \" He was standing right there and knew the shot was down so I called him a cheat , \" said Hill , whose squash career has been blighted by fines and suspensions for unacceptable behaviour . \" He knew it was down and accepted what I called him because of that . \" Hill won the game on the next point and said later that Jansher was generally honest on court but played by the referee 's decision .

Tiger Woods , who made the cut in his first tournament as a professional , shot a two-over-par 73 and was four under for the tournament .

Steve Stricker , who tied for second at last week 's World Series of Golf , and Stuart Appleby were both five shots off the lead at 14 under .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "BASEBALL - KEVIN BROWN LOWERS ERA AS MARLINS BEAT REDS . CINCINNATI 1996-08-31 Major league ERA leader Kevin Brown threw an eight-hitter and Devon White 's RBI double snapped a fifth-inning tie as the Florida Marlins beat the Cincinnati Reds 3-1 for their seventh straight win Friday . Brown ( 14-10 ) tied Todd Stottlemyre of the Cardinals for the National League lead with his fifth complete game and lowered his major league-leading earned run average from 1.96 to 1.92 . He struck out eight and did not walk a batter . Brown threw 119 pitches and won for the third time in as many starts against the Reds this season . \" Bolesy ( Florida manager John Boles ) told me yesterday , ' You have to go nine tomorrow , ' \" Brown said . \" In the early innings , I was struggling , I was just trying to make it from pitch to pitch . I gave up a lot of hits in the early innings and I was n't thinking about the seventh , eighth or ninth . I was n't satisfied with any of my pitches and I did a better job of moving the ball around in the later innings . \" \" He has a devastating sinker , \" observed Reds manager Ray Knight . \" The guys say it moved more than everyone in the league . I remember Nolan Ryan saying in ' 91 or ' 92 that he was the best young pitcher coming around in a long time and he saw ( Tom ) Seaver and ( Jerry ) Koosman when they were starting . \" In Philadelphia , Delino DeShields 's triple in the top of the 12th off Jeff Parrett ( 2-3 ) scored Chad Curtis and lifted the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 7-6 victory over the Phillies . Los Angeles won for the seventh time in eight games . Darren Dreifort ( 1-1 ) picked up the win after allowing a hit and a walk over 2 1/3 scoreless innings . Todd Worrell worked the 12th to earn his league-leading 37th save . The Phillies have dropped five of their last six overall , and nine of 11 at home . Billy Ashley belted a three-run homer for Los Angeles . In Chicago , the Braves and Cubs split a doubleheader . In the first game , Ryne Sandberg snapped an eighth-inning tie with an infield single and Kevin Foster ( 6-2 ) outdueled Atlanta 's Tom Glavine ( 13-8 ) for his third straight win , 3-2 . Foster , a .333 hitter , helped his own cause in the second with a two-run single . The Braves took the second game when Chipper Jones singled home the tying run in the top of the ninth and Andruw Jones took advantage of a poor throw to score the go-ahead run on a sacrifice fly for a 6-5 victory . Cubs shortstop Jose Hernandez committed three of Chicago 's four errors . Mike Mordecai singled , doubled and homered for Atlanta , which has won 14 of its last 19 games and has the best record in the majors , 84-50 . In Montreal , Scott Sanders allowed one hit over eight innings and Wally Joyner hit a two-run single in a four-run third as the San Diego Padres blanked the Expos 6-0 for their sixth straight win . Sanders ( 8-4 ) struck out 10 and walked three to win his fourth straight . He allowed a leadoff double to David Segui in the second , and won for the seventh time in eight decisions . The right-hander retired 14 batters in a row from the second inning through the seventh . Mike Oquist allowed one Montreal hit in the ninth . Montreal lost for the ninth time in 14 games . In New York , Marvin Benard 's two-run homer snapped a tie and Shawn Estes came one out away from his first complete game as the San Francisco Giants beat the Mets 6-4 . Benard , hitting .467 ( 14-for-30 ) against the Mets this season , hit his first pitch from Pete Harnisch ( 8-10 ) in the seventh over the right-field fence to put the Giants up 4-2 . Estes ( 3-4 ) was lifted for closer Rod Beck after yielding a single with two out in the ninth . Beck allowed a two-run double to Alvaro Espinoza , who collected a career-high four RBI , but struck out Brent Mayne for his 31st save . The loss was the Mets ' eighth straight , their longest slide since September 1993 , and dropped them to 0-4 under new manager Bobby Valentine . In St Louis , Tom Pagnozzi had three hits and three RBI and Alan Benes scattered six hits over six-plus innings as the Cardinals beat the Colorado Rockies 7-4 . Benes ( 12-8 ) allowed three runs , walked three and struck out three for the win . St Louis defeated Colorado for just the second time in 12 meetings dating back to last season . Ray Lankford went 4-for-5 with a pair of doubles for the Cardinals , who won for just the third time in 11 games . Eric Anthony hit a pair of solo homers for the Rockies . In Pittsburgh , Sean Berry tied a career high with six RBI and Donne Wall fired a seven-hitter for his first major-league shutout as the Houston Astros routed the Pirates 10-0 . It was the third time Berry had six RBI in one game . Wall ( 9-4 ) struck out four and walked none to post his second complete game of the season and third straight win .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 4842], "labels": [[[11, 22], "Q867833"], [[30, 33], "Unknown"], [[37, 44], "Q652879"], [[50, 54], "Q826751"], [[57, 67], "Q43196"], [[92, 95], "Unknown"], [[103, 114], "Q867833"], [[141, 152], "Q5267779"], [[156, 159], "Unknown"], [[201, 216], "Q652879"], [[226, 241], "Q826751"], [[286, 291], "Unknown"], [[307, 323], "Q7812659"], [[331, 340], "Q504309"], [[349, 364], "Q858082"], [[523, 528], "Unknown"], [[604, 608], "Q826751"], [[625, 631], "Unknown"], [[634, 641], "Q652879"], [[650, 660], "Q6222378"], [[720, 725], "Unknown"], [[1094, 1098], "Q826751"], [[1107, 1117], "Q3420530"], [[1190, 1200], "Q721948"], [[1299, 1313], "Unknown"], [[1318, 1335], "Unknown"], [[1367, 1379], "Q1345"], [[1382, 1398], "Q3021671"], [[1436, 1448], "Q3176572"], [[1464, 1475], "Q5066215"], [[1491, 1510], "Q334634"], [[1537, 1545], "Q650840"], [[1548, 1559], "Q334634"], [[1602, 1617], "Q5224891"], [[1707, 1719], "Q3530292"], [[1779, 1787], "Q650840"], [[1859, 1871], "Q4912127"], [[1901, 1912], "Q334634"], [[1918, 1925], "Q1297"], [[1932, 1938], "Q461595"], [[1943, 1947], "Q246782"], [[1991, 2004], "Q3453949"], [[2061, 2073], "Q6396302"], [[2092, 2099], "Q461595"], [[2103, 2114], "Q943668"], [[2159, 2165], "Unknown"], [[2247, 2253], "Q461595"], [[2280, 2293], "Q948508"], [[2349, 2361], "Q1376903"], [[2458, 2462], "Q246782"], [[2473, 2487], "Unknown"], [[2507, 2514], "Q246782"], [[2532, 2545], "Q10329950"], [[2580, 2587], "Q461595"], [[2679, 2687], "Q340"], [[2690, 2703], "Q11311626"], [[2743, 2755], "Q429733"], [[2804, 2820], "Q721134"], [[2833, 2838], "Q1148233"], [[2874, 2881], "Unknown"], [[2981, 2992], "Q3018769"], [[3149, 3160], "Q6848275"], [[3173, 3181], "Q1148233"], [[3201, 3209], "Q1148233"], [[3251, 3259], "Q60"], [[3262, 3275], "Q6778293"], [[3311, 3322], "Q7491338"], [[3377, 3397], "Q308966"], [[3407, 3411], "Q692417"], [[3418, 3424], "Q6778293"], [[3466, 3470], "Q692417"], [[3510, 3523], "Q7172005"], [[3586, 3592], "Q308966"], [[3602, 3607], "Q7491338"], [[3638, 3646], "Q3438072"], [[3699, 3703], "Q3438072"], [[3732, 3747], "Unknown"], [[3783, 3786], "Unknown"], [[3804, 3815], "Q4961469"], [[3853, 3857], "Q692417"], [[3963, 3978], "Q1101104"], [[3984, 3992], "Q38022"], [[3995, 4007], "Q7817149"], [[4033, 4036], "Unknown"], [[4041, 4051], "Q4706162"], [[4100, 4109], "Q504309"], [[4119, 4135], "Q388858"], [[4142, 4147], "Q4706162"], [[4226, 4234], "Unknown"], [[4244, 4252], "Q388858"], [[4322, 4334], "Q7297736"], [[4379, 4388], "Q504309"], [[4437, 4449], "Q5386033"], [[4484, 4491], "Q388858"], [[4497, 4507], "Q1342"], [[4510, 4520], "Q3476696"], [[4549, 4552], "Unknown"], [[4557, 4567], "Q5296563"], [[4631, 4645], "Q848117"], [[4657, 4664], "Q653772"], [[4694, 4699], "Q3476696"], [[4708, 4711], "Unknown"], [[4726, 4730], "Q5296563"]]}
{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "TENNIS - EDBERG REFUSES TO QO QUIETLY . Richard Finn NEW YORK 1996-08-30 Refusing to go quietly in the night , Stefan Edberg extended his stay at his 14th and last U.S. Open when Bernd Karbacher , trailing and hurting , quit in the fourth set of their second-round match Friday . The 30-year-old Edberg , a former two-time Open champion , had wrestled control of the match away from Karbacher when the German , hampered by a left hamstring injury , decided he could n't continue under the stadium lights at the National Tennis Centre . \" A win is a win . I 'll take it , \" Edberg , who has announced that this will be his last Grand Slam event , said of the 3-6 6-3 6-3 1-0 victory . Ironically , Karbacher two years ago ended Ivan Lendl 's Grand Slam career here when the former champion had to retire in the middle of their first-round match . After seeing the trainer come out early in the third set , Edberg was not surprised by Karbacher 's decision not to go on . \" I knew he had problems with something , \" Edberg said . \" I really was n't surprised . \" Edberg had his own problems early in the match as the Swede battled to acclimate himself to the nighttime conditions while Karbacher was ripping passing shots and blasting serves past him . \" I did n't really feel good to begin with , I had problems finding the timing on the ball , seeing the ball , \" said Edberg , who upset Wimbledon champion and fifth-seeded Richard Krajicek in the first round . \" This was one of these matches where I did n't play up to my standard . I had to fight hard . \" Edberg 's tenacity paid off in the second set . Edberg lost his own serve twice , but he rallied for three breaks of his own , the last to wrap up the set . \" That 's where the match sort of changed , \" said Edberg . \" I think once I got that second set , I felt a lot better about my game . \" Edberg is starting to feel pretty good about postponing his swan song a lot longer . \" It does n't look all that bad , \" Edberg said of his path through the draw starting next with a match against Krajicek 's Dutch countryman Paul Haarhuis . However , the 1991 and 1992 champion is not ready to start making plans to be in next week 's final . \" I 'm always being realistic , \" said Edberg . \" Like I said many times , I think it 's a very little chance , but nothing is impossible . If I play great tennis , that could take me a long way . \" A lot of things can happen , like tonight . \"", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 2441], "labels": [[[9, 15], "Q189542"], [[40, 52], "Unknown"], [[53, 61], "Q60"], [[111, 124], "Q189542"], [[164, 173], "Q123577"], [[179, 194], "Q73280"], [[296, 302], "Q189542"], [[323, 327], "Unknown"], [[383, 392], "Q73280"], [[402, 408], "Q183"], [[511, 533], "Unknown"], [[573, 579], "Q189542"], [[627, 637], "Q102113"], [[697, 706], "Q73280"], [[727, 737], "Q182736"], [[741, 751], "Q102113"], [[905, 911], "Q189542"], [[933, 942], "Q73280"], [[1014, 1020], "Q189542"], [[1061, 1067], "Q189542"], [[1115, 1120], "Unknown"], [[1184, 1193], "Q73280"], [[1369, 1375], "Q189542"], [[1388, 1397], "Q41520"], [[1424, 1440], "Q309859"], [[1559, 1565], "Q189542"], [[1607, 1613], "Q189542"], [[1767, 1773], "Q189542"], [[1853, 1859], "Q189542"], [[1974, 1980], "Q189542"], [[2050, 2058], "Q309859"], [[2062, 2067], "Q55"], [[2079, 2092], "Q29441"], [[2236, 2242], "Q189542"]]}

Steve Pagani VIENNA 1996-08-31 Austria dominated their World Cup group four qualifier against Scotland on Saturday with wave after wave of attacks but were unable to penetrate the visitors ' defence and had to settle for a goalless draw . Scotland , who thrashed Belarus 5-1 in their opening group four match , were unable to repeat their performance . Austria 's best chance came in the 63rd minute with Stephan Marasek of SC Freiburg taking advantage of a scramble in the Scottish penalty area but his shot narrowly passing the left-hand post .

PARIS 1996-08-31 Euro 96 absentee Nicolas Ouedec and Youri Djorkaeff scored the goals as 1998 World Cup hosts France beat Mexico 2-0 in a friendly international on Saturday . The victory extended to 29 matches France 's unbeaten run under coach Aime Jacquet , their Euro 96 semifinal elimination having come in a penalty shoot-out , but was marred by the sending-off of Chelsea central defender Franck Leboeuf . Leboeuf was dismissed two minutes from time for a second bookable offence , fouling Mexican substitute Ricardo Pelaez who minutes earlier had also been shown the yellow card for pushing the Chelsea defender in the back . Both goals came early in the second half after France had surprised the Mexicans with three half-time substitutions . After a sterile first half , France injected more sting in midfield with the introduction of Juventus 's Zinedine Zidane . This allowed Djorkaeff to play further up and his cross from the right fell for Ouedec , who has joined Espanyol of Barcelona from Nantes since missing the European championship finals through injury , to score after a mistake by midfielder Joaquin del Olmo . Within four minutes Ouedec was returning the compliment for Djorkaeff , playing a one-two with the Internazionale Milan forward down the middle to set him up for a cross shot past diving goalkeeper Osvaldo Sanchez .

Bert Lauwers BRUSSELS 1996-08-31 Belgium kicked off their 1998 World Cup campaign with a hard-fought 2-1 victory over 10-man Turkey in a tense match marred by Turkish crowd trouble shortly after the break . Turkish fans , upset at their team 's 2-0 first-half deficit , ripped apart dozens of plastic seats and threw them over the fence . Riot police took 10 minutes to restore order . The police were given an unexpected hand by second-half substitute Sergen Yalcin who rekindled Turkish hopes in the 61st with a splendid half-volley which stunned Belgian goalkeeper Filip De Wilde . But Yalcin , who had come on just four minutes earlier , turned from hero to villain barely two minutes after his strike when he was sent off after spitting at an opponent and arguing with English referee David Elleray . Marc Degryse had opened the scoring for Belgium after 13 minutes , whacking a low 10-metre drive into the net after an incisive pass by defender Dirk Medved from the edge of the penalty area . Brazilian-born Luis Oliveira then gleefully slipped the ball past goalkeeper Rustu Recber from the right of the area to make it 2-0 seven minutes before the interval , Turkey 's best first-half effort proving to be a vicious 30-metre shot by Ogun Temizkanoglu which De Wilde tipped over . The visitors , seeking to restore some pride after failing to score a single goal in Euro 96 in June , repeatedly ripped through the left side of the home defence but De Wilde was able to block several sharply-angled efforts . With only the group seven winners qualifying automatically for the 1998 finals in France , Belgium could not afford a slip-up at home and they frantically chased a decisive third goal . But they were almost upset 12 minutes from time when De Wilde fumbled a hard Arif Erdem shot and Orhan Cikirikci almost pounced on the loose ball . Belgium 's best second-half effort came three minutes later when Degryse put the ball over the bar from close range with Recber beaten .

More than a thousand women , children and men gathered in a field to the north of the town of Urus-Martan on Saturday to wait for a column of rebels to withdraw from the capital Grozny about 25 km ( 12 miles ) away . The men fired weapons into the air as groups of women danced . Adults in the crowd carried posters of former Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev -- who declared independence in 1991 -- and children , carrying photographs of him , called \" Troops out ! \" . Russian military officials have expressed fears that the rebels and their supporters will see the deal signed by Russian peace envoy Alexander Lebed in the early hours of Saturday as a military victory for the separatists . It involves the withdrawal of Russian troops sent to Chechnya in December 1994 to crush the separatists and a postponement of the issue at the heart of the conflict -- the status of the mainly-Moslem North Caucasus region . But the people in the crowd on Saturday , who had turned out in support of the rebels , did not seem sure that the war was over . \" We hope for the best , that it really has ended so we can live in peace . It 's our only dream , \" said a 30-year-old woman , Mubatik Dagayeva . Aiza Dudayeva , with her 10-year-old son beside her , shared the guarded optimism . \" We really want the war to end , we hope and believe that our sons and brothers will win , \" said Dudayeva , adding that she was from Urus-Martan . Urus-Martan is a traditionally anti-separatist pocket in Chechnya and Moscow-backed leader Doku Zavgayev , who has been sidelined in the peace deal , has warned that it and places like it could become centres of civil war if Russian troops leave . But on Saturday the people gathered just outside the town seemed to be united in favour of the separatists .

The consortium wanted 40 percent of Ruch 's shares , the state would get 20 percent of Ruch and 40 percent would be offered on the Warsaw stock exchange . \" This division would guarantee a dispersal of capital , preventing anyone from taking total control over Ruch and dictating market conditions , \" the paper quoted one of the initiators of the move as saying , without giving a name .

It aims to invest $ 200 million in Ruch over five years -- more than the sum Ruch says it needs to upgrade its outlets . Initially Poland offered up to 75 percent of Ruch but in March Kaczmarek cancelled the tender and offered a minority stake with an option to increase the equity . Two consortia -- UWP-Hachette and a consortium of a Polish SPC group and Swiss firms -- placed initial bids . But after the change of tender conditions Swiss investors pulled out and SPC decided to bid jointly with UWP-Hachette .

Xiao Qiang , executive director of the New York-based group Human Rights in China , said Wang 's arrest on Friday appeared to be part of the national \" Strike Hard \" campaign that has imprisoned thousands and sent hundreds to their death . Although supposedly aimed at criminals , dozens of human rights activists have been detained in the campaign , which is meant to strengthen the Communist Party 's grip on power as senior leader Deng Xiaoping nears death , Xiao said in an interview . \" China is going through this power transition period .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "Burma 's Suu Kyi says military rulers abuse law . Deborah Charles RANGOON 1996-08-31 Burma 's democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi hit out at the government on Saturday for recent arrests and jailing of activists , saying the military abused the law to try to crush the democracy movement . \" The main purpose of this press conference is to make it known to the world that the authorities are misusing the law all the time in order to try to crush the democracy movement , \" Suu Kyi told reporters at her Rangoon home . Suu Kyi said at least 61 democracy supporters had been arrested since May , and about 30 of them had been sentenced , most to long prison terms . In May the government launched a sweeping crackdown on the democracy movement , detaining over 260 members of Suu Kyi 's National League for Democracy ( NLD ) ahead of a party congress . Most were released but several dozen remain in custody . The Burmese government last week confirmed the recent sentencing of nine democracy activists who were arrested in the May crackdown , including Suu Kyi 's assistant Win Htein . The military government , which in May said it had detained the politicians to prevent anarchy , said the activists were charged with attempting to destroy the peace and stability of the state . But Suu Kyi disagreed with the methods , saying officials often arrested NLD supporters in the middle of the night , then did not give them the opportunity to defend themselves in trials . \" When our people are tried , they are tried in a very secretive way . Their families are not told , \" she said . Suu Kyi , who spearheads a campaign for sanctions on Burma 's government , was under house arrest for six years without being tried before being released in July 1995 . Several other leading members of the NLD have served prison terms . The NLD party won a landslide victory in a 1990 election but the State Law and Order Restoration Council ( SLORC ) , which assumed power in 1988 after crushing pro-democracy demonstrations , never recognised the poll . \" This lack of rule of law is an indication that the authorities are not interested in fair play , \" she said . \" They are using a travesty of the law to try and crush our movements and to sentence our people to long terms in prison without proper trial . \" Suu Kyi said once the activists were sentenced , they suffered inhuman conditions and lack of rights in prison . \" Almost all of the prisoners start suffering from various health problems after a couple of years in jail , \" she said . \" Some of our people have been in prison for five to six years . \" Most political prisoners are held in Rangoon 's Insein Prison . Some who have been released have recounted torture methods like sleep and food deprivation and physical abuse . \" If there are any more instances of death in custody it will be further proof that a prison sentence for political prisoners is sometimes almost the same as a death sentence , \" Suu Kyi said . Hla Than , an elected member of parliament for the NLD , died in early August after being at Insein for six years . His death came five weeks after James Leander ( Leo ) Nichols , a close friend of Suu Kyi and Danish honorary consul , died while serving a prison term at Insein . Suu Kyi said the government had increased its repression tactics on the democracy movement because it feared the growing popularity of the movement . But she said she and the NLD would not stop their efforts to bring democracy to Burma even if it meant more arrests of party members or even herself . \" We will carry on .

DETROIT 1996-08-31 Automakers , suppliers , insurers and the federal government 's auto safety agency Saturday launched a $ 10 million safety awareness campaign aimed at reducing the number of children killed accidentally by air bags in cars and trucks . Officials said they will work with law enforcement agencies , pediatricians and media to warn parents about the dangers that air bags pose to children and adults not wearing seatbelts . Since 1993 , 24 children have been killed by the explosive force of automotive air bags , which inflate at speeds up to 200 miles per hour .

A child 's chances of being killed in a car accident , whether the vehicle was equipped with an air bag or not , is reduced by 29 percent when they are in the rear seat , she said . The auto industry was about three to six years away from introducing \" smart \" air bags with the ability to detect the size and position of an occupant and adjust inflation pressures accordingly . Current air bags were designed to halt the forward momentum of an average-sized , unbelted adult male , not a small child . Automakers petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to allow them to introduce air bags that inflate less aggressively to help reduce unwanted injuries . \" Even if changes are made to airbags today , we 'd still have 20 million vehicles on the road with current technology , \" Dewey said . \" The public has n't been getting the message . \"", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 2066], "labels": [[[13, 17], "Q30"], [[51, 58], "Q12439"], [[800, 809], "Q848352"], [[830, 843], "Q94967"], [[851, 861], "Unknown"], [[864, 878], "Q94873"], [[883, 885], "Unknown"], [[893, 900], "Q186545"], [[905, 917], "Q54725"], [[921, 931], "Q99"], [[1007, 1018], "Unknown"], [[1063, 1111], "Unknown"], [[1732, 1778], "Unknown"], [[2004, 2009], "Unknown"]]}

An estimated 50,000 people have died in Algeria 's violence pitting Moslem rebels against government forces since early 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a commanding lead .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 1301], "labels": [[[0, 7], "Q262"], [[50, 55], "Q90"], [[108, 115], "Q3561"], [[151, 159], "Q262"], [[189, 197], "Q262"], [[356, 364], "Q2217496"], [[371, 379], "Q3224404"], [[463, 470], "Unknown"], [[718, 728], "Unknown"], [[755, 762], "Q262"], [[821, 829], "Q262"], [[852, 885], "Unknown"], [[888, 892], "Unknown"], [[1028, 1034], "Q432"], [[1110, 1117], "Q262"], [[1138, 1144], "Q432"], [[1262, 1271], "Q189746"]]}

BONN 1996-08-31 Iranian security forces burst into the home of a German cultural attache in Tehran a month ago and seized his guests for questioning , Bonn 's foreign ministry said on Saturday . A spokesman said he could substantially confirm a report in the news weekly Der Spiegel , which said Iranian secret police burst in while attache Jens Gust was entertaining six Iranian writers and their wives . Gust was threatened with violence , then locked into a room to be interrogated on suspicion of \" promoting activities hostile to the state \" while his guests were taken away , the magazine said . The ministry spokesman said the German embassy immediately made a sharp protest to the Tehran government . The Iranian ambassador was also summoned to the ministry in Bonn to hear a sharp protest and \" disapproval of this glaring breach of the principles of international law \" , he added . Iran subsequently said it regretted the incident , which it said had been the result of a misunderstanding . All those detained appeared to have been freed , the spokesman said . Relations between the two countries are currently under strain because of the testimony in a Berlin court of former Iranian president Abolhassan Banisadr . Banisadr , an avowed opponent of the Tehran government who now lives in exile , accused top Iranian leaders of personally ordering the assassination of three exiled Kurdish leaders in a Berlin restaurant in 1992 . Iran has asked Germany to extradite Banisadr , who is due is due back in Berlin next Thursday to continue his testimony . Banisadr , who received political asylum in France after fleeing there in 1981 , told Der Spiegel he did not plan to ask for a guarantee of safe conduct . If Germany were to extradite him , he said , it would \" lose face before the whole world \" . German prosecutors have already accused Iran 's intelligence minister Ali Fallahiyan of ordering the killing of the Kurdish leaders . Iran , which denies the allegations , urged German authorities to disregard Banisadr 's testimony and said it could hurt relations .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 2132], "labels": [[[0, 4], "Q794"], [[20, 26], "Q183"], [[47, 51], "Q586"], [[54, 58], "Q586"], [[70, 77], "Q794"], [[119, 125], "Q183"], [[146, 152], "Q3616"], [[205, 209], "Q586"], [[325, 336], "Q131478"], [[350, 357], "Q794"], [[395, 404], "Unknown"], [[426, 433], "Q794"], [[460, 464], "Unknown"], [[688, 694], "Q183"], [[743, 749], "Q3616"], [[767, 774], "Q794"], [[823, 827], "Q586"], [[947, 951], "Q794"], [[1219, 1225], "Q64"], [[1242, 1249], "Q794"], [[1260, 1279], "Q273866"], [[1282, 1290], "Q273866"], [[1319, 1325], "Q3616"], [[1374, 1381], "Q794"], [[1447, 1454], "Q41470"], [[1468, 1474], "Q64"], [[1496, 1500], "Q794"], [[1511, 1518], "Q183"], [[1532, 1540], "Q273866"], [[1569, 1575], "Q64"], [[1618, 1626], "Q273866"], [[1662, 1668], "Q142"], [[1704, 1715], "Q131478"], [[1776, 1783], "Q183"], [[1866, 1872], "Q183"], [[1906, 1910], "Q794"], [[1936, 1950], "Unknown"], [[1982, 1989], "Q41470"], [[2000, 2004], "Q794"], [[2044, 2050], "Q183"], [[2076, 2084], "Q273866"]]}

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "Controversial IRA film screened at Venice festival . Vera Haller VENICE , Italy 1996-08-31 Dublin-born director Neil Jordan says he never lost more sleep over a film than over \" Michael Collins \" , his controversial epic about the IRA which has its premiere on Saturday at the Venice Film Festival . The film , starring Liam Neeson and Julia Roberts , recounts the life of Michael Collins , the Irish Republican Army 's Director of Intelligence who fought for Irish independence from 1919 to 1921 . Although not due for release in Britain until early next year , some politicians have already said they feared it would fan sectarian tensions in British-ruled Northern Ireland . Jordan defends his decision to make the film , whose screenplay he wrote himself after years of research , saying it was \" more about history than any political statement \" . \" The film spares neither the Irish nor the British in its depiction of the savagery of the time , \" Jordan said in a statement released by Warner Bros . \" How often has independence been achieved without bloodshed ? Very rarely . \" Jordan , whose 1992 film \" The Crying Game \" also came under fire for what was perceived as a sympathetic portrayal of the IRA , said Collins was more than just a revolutionary . \" He developed techniques of guerilla warfare later copied by independence movements around the world , from Mao Tse-Tung in China to Yitzak Shamir in Israel , \" Jordan said . \" Collins would never be a proponent of contemporary terrorism as practised today . He was a soldier and a statesman and , over time , a man of peace . \" Leeson , the Northern Ireland-born actor who was nominated for an Oscar for best actor for his performance in \" Schindler 's List \" , plays the lead role in Jordan 's film . Aidan Quinn portrays Harry Boland , Collins ' best friend , and rival for the love of Kitty Kiernan , played by Roberts . Much of the film was shot on location in Dublin with Jordan using thousands of its citizens as unpaid extras . A set , however , was used for the fighting scenes . Noting that information about Collins was \" as mysterious as the existence he maintained \" , Jordan said he made some historical assumptions in the film . \" I have made choices about certain events based on my own extensive research into his letters and reported speeches , \" he said . \" I wanted to make this a story as accurate as possible without killing it dramatically and I think I have . It is a very true film . \" One of the assumptions is his interpretation of the murky circumstances surrounding the shooting death of Collins , who had broken with his comrades when he sought a negotiated settlement with Britain , in an ambush in 1922 . \" I have never lost more sleep over the making of a film than I have over ' Michael Collins ' , but I 'll never make a more important one , \" Jordan said . \" In the life of one person you can tell the events that formed the north and south of Ireland as they are today . \"", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 2975], "labels": [[[14, 17], "Q175284"], [[35, 41], "Q641"], [[53, 64], "Unknown"], [[74, 79], "Q38"], [[112, 123], "Q55428"], [[178, 193], "Q430535"], [[231, 234], "Q175284"], [[277, 297], "Q49024"], [[320, 331], "Q58444"], [[336, 349], "Q40523"], [[373, 388], "Q173196"], [[395, 416], "Q175284"], [[460, 465], "Q27"], [[531, 538], "Q145"], [[645, 658], "Unknown"], [[659, 675], "Q26"], [[678, 684], "Q55428"], [[883, 888], "Q27"], [[897, 904], "Q145"], [[954, 960], "Q55428"], [[993, 1004], "Q126399"], [[1086, 1092], "Q55428"], [[1113, 1128], "Q182727"], [[1209, 1212], "Q175284"], [[1220, 1227], "Q173196"], [[1374, 1386], "Q5816"], [[1390, 1395], "Q148"], [[1399, 1412], "Q184351"], [[1416, 1422], "Q801"], [[1427, 1433], "Q55428"], [[1443, 1450], "Q173196"], [[1595, 1601], "Unknown"], [[1608, 1629], "Unknown"], [[1661, 1666], "Q103916"], [[1707, 1724], "Unknown"], [[1752, 1758], "Q55428"], [[1769, 1780], "Q403902"], [[1790, 1802], "Q1785574"], [[1805, 1812], "Q173196"], [[1855, 1868], "Q4581421"], [[1881, 1888], "Q40523"], [[1932, 1938], "Q1761"], [[1944, 1950], "Q55428"], [[2085, 2092], "Q173196"], [[2148, 2154], "Q55428"], [[2583, 2590], "Q173196"], [[2670, 2677], "Q145"], [[2779, 2794], "Q430535"], [[2845, 2851], "Q55428"], [[2946, 2953], "Q22890"]]}

AL-AIN , United Arab Emirates 1996-12-06 Two goals in the last six minutes gave holders Japan an uninspiring 2-1 Asian Cup victory over Syria on Friday . Takuya Takagi headed the winner in the 88th minute of the group C game after goalkeeper Salem Bitar spoiled a mistake-free display by allowing the ball to slip under his body . It was the second Syrian defensive blunder in four minutes . Defender Hassan Abbas rose to intercept a long ball into the area in the 84th minute but only managed to divert it into the top corner of Bitar 's goal . Syria had taken the lead from their first serious attack in the seventh minute . Nader Jokhadar headed a cross from the right by Ammar Awad into the top right corner of Kenichi Shimokawa 's goal . Japan then laid siege to the Syrian penalty area and had a goal disallowed for offside in the 16th minute . A minute later , Bitar produced a good double save , first from Kazuyoshi Miura 's header and then blocked a Takagi follow-up shot . Bitar saved well again from Miura in the 37th minute , parrying away his header from a corner . Japan started the second half brightly but Bitar denied them an equaliser when he dived to his right to save Naoki Soma 's low drive in the 53rd minute .

Robert Kitson LONDON 1996-12-06 Centre Jason Little will miss Australia 's end-of-tour fixture against the Barbarians at Twickenham on Saturday . Little has opted not to risk aggravating the knee injury which ruled him out of a large chunk of the tour and is replaced by fellow Queenslander Daniel Herbert . Owen Finegan has recovered from the knocks he took in last weekend 's test against Wales and retains his place in the back-row ahead of Daniel Manu . The Wallabies have their sights set on a 13th successive victory to end their European tour with a 100 percent record but also want to turn on the style and provide David Campese with a fitting send-off in his final match in Australian colours . The Wallabies currently have no plans to make any special presentation to the 34-year-old winger but a full house of 75,000 spectators will still gather in the hope of witnessing one last moment of magic . Campese will be up against a familiar foe in the shape of Barbarians captain Rob Andrew , the man who kicked Australia to defeat with a last-ditch drop-goal in the World Cup quarter-final in Cape Town . \" Campo has a massive following in this country and has had the public with him ever since he first played here in 1984 , \" said Andrew , also likely to be making his final Twickenham appearance . On tour , Australia have won all four tests against Italy , Scotland , Ireland and Wales , and scored 414 points at an average of almost 35 points a game . League duties restricted the Barbarians ' selectorial options but they still boast 13 internationals including England full-back Tim Stimpson and recalled wing Tony Underwood , plus All Black forwards Ian Jones and Norm Hewitt .

Robert Galvin MELBOURNE 1996-12-06 Australia gave Brian Lara another reason to be miserable when they beat West Indies by five wickets in the opening World Series limited overs match on Friday . Lara , disciplined for misconduct on Wednesday , was dismissed for five to extend a disappointing run of form on tour . Australia , who hold a 2-0 lead in the five-match test series , overhauled West Indies ' total of 172 all out with eight balls to spare to end a run of six successive one-day defeats . All-rounder Greg Blewett steered his side to a comfortable victory with an unbeaten 57 in 90 balls to the delight of the 42,442 crowd . Man-of-the match Blewett came to the wicket with the total on 70 for two and hit three fours during an untroubled innings lasting 129 minutes . His crucial fifth-wicket partnership with fellow all-rounder Stuart Law , who scored 21 , added 71 off 85 balls . Lara looked out of touch during his brief stay at the crease before chipping a simple catch to Shane Warne at mid-wicket . West Indies tour manager Clive Lloyd has apologised for Lara 's behaviour on Tuesday . He ( Lara ) had told Australia coach Geoff Marsh that wicketkeeper Ian Healy was unwelcome in the visitors ' dressing room . The Melbourne crowd were clearly angered by the incident , loudly jeering the West Indies vice-captain as he walked to the middle . It was left to fellow left-hander Shivnarine Chanderpaul to hold the innings together with a gritty 54 despite the handicap of an injured groin . Chanderpaul was forced to rely on a runner for most of his innings after hurting himself as he scurried back to his crease to avoid being run out .

MELBOURNE 1996-12-06 West Indies batsman Brian Lara suffered another blow to his Australian tour , after already being disciplined for misconduct , when he was dismissed cheaply in the first limited overs match against Australia on Friday . Lara , who earned a stern rebuke from his own tour management after an angry outburst against Australia wicketkeeper Ian Healy , scored five to prolong a run of poor form with the bat . The West Indies vice-captain struggled for timing during his 36-minute stay at the crease before chipping a ball from medium pacer Tom Moody straight to Shane Warne at mid-wicket . West Indies were 53 for two in 15 overs when rain stopped play at the Melbourne Cricket Ground after captain Courtney Walsh won the toss and elected to bat . Lara 's outburst three days ago has clearly turned some of the Australian public against him . As he walked to the wicket he was greeted by loud jeers from sections of the crowd . On several occasions during his innings , the crowd joined together in a series of obscene chants against him . Tour manager Clive Lloyd on Wednesday apologised for Lara 's behaviour in confronting Australia coach Geoff Marsh in the opposition dressing room to protest against his dismissal in the second test on Tuesday . Lloyd did not say what form the discipline would take . Lara , who holds the record for the highest score in test and first-class cricket , was unhappy about Healy 's role in the incident and questioned whether the ball had carried to the Australia keeper . Australia went on to win the match at the Sydney Cricket Ground by 124 runs to take a two-nil lead in the five-test series after Lara failed in both innings . Lara has yet to score a century since West Indies arrived in Australia five weeks ago . Both West Indies and Australia team management have played down the incident , stressing that relations between the two sides have not been adversely affected . Pakistan , who arrive next week , are the third team in the triangular World Series tournament .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 2084], "labels": [[[10, 14], "Q202877"], [[53, 62], "Q3141"], [[74, 85], "Q912881"], [[94, 104], "Q202877"], [[134, 144], "Q408"], [[272, 281], "Q142555"], [[294, 298], "Q202877"], [[388, 397], "Q142555"], [[411, 420], "Q349135"], [[484, 495], "Q912881"], [[611, 620], "Q3537597"], [[633, 644], "Q555240"], [[661, 672], "Q912881"], [[731, 755], "Q330136"], [[770, 784], "Q983740"], [[819, 823], "Q202877"], [[882, 892], "Q408"], [[1124, 1135], "Q1101987"], [[1164, 1168], "Q202877"], [[1197, 1206], "Q142555"], [[1213, 1224], "Q2743480"], [[1322, 1327], "Q1101987"], [[1378, 1382], "Q202877"], [[1480, 1485], "Q349135"], [[1561, 1570], "Q142555"], [[1580, 1589], "Q142555"], [[1622, 1643], "Q856393"], [[1709, 1713], "Q202877"], [[1739, 1743], "Q202877"], [[1777, 1788], "Q912881"], [[1800, 1809], "Q408"], [[1832, 1843], "Q912881"], [[1848, 1857], "Q142555"], [[1988, 1996], "Q182538"], [[2059, 2071], "Q3349761"]]}

ROME 1996-12-06 Italian Serie A games to be played on Sunday ( league positions in parentheses , all kick- off times GMT ) : Bologna ( 4 ) v Piacenza ( 13 ) 1330 Along with leaders Vicenza , fourth-placed Bologna represent the biggest surprise of this Italian autumn . Led as usual by Swede Kennet Andersson and Russian Igor Kolyvanov in attack , Bologna can expect a tough home match against a Piacenza side still exultant after a 3-2 league win over AC Milan last Sunday . Cagliari ( 16 ) v Reggiana ( 18 ) 1530 Cagliari start favourite in this relegation scrap following draws with Napoli and Inter in last two outings but will be without suspended Swiss defender Ramon Vega . Bottom team Reggiana are also without a suspended defender , German Dietmar Beiersdorfer . Fiorentina ( 10 ) v Perugia ( 8 ) 1330 Fiorentina will be without three suspended players -- defenders Daniele Carnasciali and Lorenzo Amoruso and midfielder Emiliano Bigica -- for a difficult home match against unpredictable , attack-oriented Perugia led by in-form Croat striker Milan Rapajic and the experienced Fausto Pizzi . Lazio ( 12 ) v AS Roma ( 7 ) 1930 Poor man 's Roman derby in what has been a miserable season for both Rome teams , already eliminated from the Italian and UEFA Cups . Lazio have injury doubts about striker Pierluigi Casiraghi , Czech midfielder Pavel Nedved and defender Paolo Negro , while Roma present a full strength side led by Argentine Abel Balbo , Marco Delvecchio and Francesco Totti in attack . AC Milan ( 9 ) v Udinese ( 11 ) 1330 Can Milan sink any further ? Following their midweek Champions ' League elimination by Norwegian side Rosenborg , a morale-boosting win is badly needed . Liberian striker George Weah makes a welcome return for Milan alongside Roberto Baggio , with Montenegrin Dejan Savicevic in midfield . Good news for Milan is that Udinese 's German striker Oliver Bierhoff is out through injury . Napoli ( 5 ) v Verona ( 17 ) 1330 In-form Napoli should prove too strong for second from bottom Verona despite the absence of their suspended Argentine defender Roberto Ayala . Verona 's slim chances have been further reduced by a knee injury to their experienced midfielder Eugenio Corini . Parma ( 14 ) v Atlalanta ( 15 ) 1330 Parma may field new signing , Croat midfielder Mario Stanic , in an attempt to lift a miserable season which has seen them go without a win since a 1-0 triumph over Cagliari eight weeks ago . Parma 's French midfielder Daniel Bravo and defender Fabio Cannavaro are suspended while Argentine Nestor Sensini is out through injury . Atalanta look to Filippo Inzaghi , scorer of eight goals . Sampdoria ( 6 ) v Juventus ( 3 ) 1330 All-conquering Juventus field their most recent signing , Portuguese defender Dimas , while Alessandro Del Piero and Croat Alen Boksic lead the attack . The new world club champions may prove too strong for a Sampdoria side led by captain Roberto Mancini but missing injured French midfielder Pierre Laigle . Vicenza ( 1 ) v Internazionale ( 2 ) 1330 Not exactly a clash of the titans but an intriuguing match nonetheless . Full strength Vicenza , led by Uruguayan Marcelo Otero , may continue their surprise run at the top against an Inter side that has been less than impressive in three successive home draws . Inter will be without suspended French defender Joceyln Angloma and injured Chilean striker Ivan Zamorano .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 3459], "labels": [[[9, 16], "Q38"], [[55, 59], "Q220"], [[71, 78], "Q38"], [[79, 86], "Q15804"], [[172, 175], "Q30192"], [[180, 187], "Q1893"], [[196, 204], "Q459794"], [[236, 243], "Q8643"], [[260, 267], "Q1893"], [[307, 314], "Q38"], [[340, 345], "Q34"], [[346, 362], "Q352241"], [[367, 374], "Q159"], [[375, 389], "Q1359619"], [[402, 409], "Q1893"], [[450, 458], "Q459794"], [[507, 515], "Q1543"], [[530, 538], "Q1900"], [[548, 556], "Q289707"], [[569, 577], "Q1900"], [[640, 646], "Q2641"], [[651, 656], "Q631"], [[707, 712], "Q39"], [[722, 732], "Q676250"], [[747, 755], "Q289707"], [[796, 802], "Q183"], [[803, 823], "Q530620"], [[826, 836], "Q2052"], [[846, 853], "Q16344"], [[865, 875], "Q2052"], [[929, 948], "Q1541244"], [[953, 968], "Q738873"], [[984, 999], "Unknown"], [[1070, 1077], "Q16344"], [[1093, 1098], "Q224"], [[1107, 1120], "Unknown"], [[1141, 1153], "Q3740398"], [[1156, 1161], "Q2609"], [[1171, 1178], "Q2739"], [[1202, 1207], "Q220"], [[1259, 1263], "Q220"], [[1300, 1307], "Q38"], [[1312, 1321], "Q18760"], [[1324, 1329], "Q2609"], [[1363, 1382], "Q378583"], [[1385, 1390], "Q213"], [[1402, 1414], "Q171295"], [[1428, 1439], "Q561227"], [[1448, 1452], "Q2739"], [[1489, 1498], "Q414"], [[1499, 1509], "Q318387"], [[1512, 1528], "Q250093"], [[1533, 1548], "Q20110"], [[1561, 1569], "Q1543"], [[1578, 1585], "Q2798"], [[1602, 1607], "Q1543"], [[1651, 1669], "Unknown"], [[1685, 1694], "Q20"], [[1700, 1709], "Q186785"], [[1752, 1760], "Q1014"], [[1769, 1780], "Q173139"], [[1808, 1813], "Q1543"], [[1824, 1838], "Q67964"], [[1846, 1857], "Q236"], [[1858, 1873], "Q135625"], [[1902, 1907], "Q1543"], [[1916, 1923], "Q2798"], [[1927, 1933], "Q183"], [[1942, 1957], "Q152844"], [[1982, 1988], "Q2641"], [[1997, 2003], "Q8639"], [[2024, 2030], "Q2641"], [[2078, 2084], "Q8639"], [[2124, 2133], "Q414"], [[2143, 2156], "Q189535"], [[2159, 2165], "Q8639"], [[2257, 2271], "Q511092"], [[2274, 2279], "Q2693"], [[2289, 2298], "Unknown"], [[2311, 2316], "Q2693"], [[2341, 2346], "Q224"], [[2358, 2370], "Q350452"], [[2476, 2484], "Q1900"], [[2503, 2508], "Q2693"], [[2512, 2518], "Q142"], [[2530, 2542], "Q718471"], [[2556, 2571], "Q102027"], [[2592, 2601], "Q414"], [[2602, 2616], "Unknown"], [[2641, 2649], "Q1886"], [[2658, 2673], "Q126503"], [[2700, 2709], "Q1457"], [[2718, 2726], "Q1422"], [[2753, 2761], "Q1422"], [[2796, 2806], "Q45"], [[2816, 2821], "Q725768"], [[2830, 2850], "Q624"], [[2855, 2860], "Q224"], [[2861, 2872], "Q313518"], [[2947, 2956], "Q1457"], [[2977, 2992], "Q48330"], [[3013, 3019], "Q142"], [[3031, 3044], "Q2093651"], [[3047, 3054], "Q8643"], [[3063, 3077], "Q631"], [[3176, 3183], "Q8643"], [[3193, 3202], "Q77"], [[3203, 3216], "Q2460347"], [[3273, 3278], "Q631"], [[3352, 3357], "Q631"], [[3384, 3390], "Q142"], [[3400, 3415], "Unknown"], [[3428, 3435], "Q298"], [[3444, 3457], "Q192035"]]}

Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati , unveiling first findings of a special government commission , said that in 1970s the then communist Poland received 460,000 Swiss francs from the accounts . \" In 1970s , Poland received from unclaimed accounts in Switzerland a sum of 460,000 francs . What was its right ( to the money ) ...I do not know , \" Rosati told a news conference . Switzerland stands accused by Senator Alfonse D'Amato , chairman of the powerful U.S. Senate Banking Committee , of agreeing to give money to Poland from unclaimed bank accounts of Polish citizens , as part of an accord on compensating Swiss nationals whose assets had been seized in communist Poland . Many of these citizens were Jews murdered during the war , when Nazi German invaders killed most of Poland 's 3.5 million Jews . Rosati did not say whether the payment in 1970s was part of the 1949 agreement between Warsaw and Switzerland on compensation to Swiss citizens whose assets were seized by the Soviet-imposed communists authorities after World War Two . \" I expect that the commission will finish gathering information within two to three weeks and then more details will be provided , \" Rosati said . Rosati confirmed that the 1949 agreement had provided for granting Switzerland about 53 million francs and most of this sum was repaid with coal exports . He said , however , that Switzerland did get about 16,000 francs from the so-called \" dead accounts \" as part of the compensation . \" About 16,000 francs were seized from accounts of four or five Polish citizens , whose data we do not precisely know . The issue is of moral and legal nature , because its financial significance is small , \" Rosati said . Under pressure from international Jewish organisations , Swiss government has devised a plan to pay out millions of dollars in unclaimed bank accounts as a conciliatory gesture toward Holocaust victims . The conservative Radical Democrats ( FDP ) have said they would ask parliament next week to order Swiss banks to put some 40 million Swiss francs ( $ 31 million ) in dormant wealth into a fund earmarked for Jewish groups and charitable organisations . But Swiss banks and the country 's Jewish community voiced doubts whether the plan would work .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 2537], "labels": [[[0, 6], "Q36"], [[31, 36], "Q39"], [[48, 64], "Unknown"], [[65, 71], "Q270"], [[83, 89], "Q36"], [[110, 115], "Q39"], [[164, 170], "Q36"], [[171, 175], "Q7325"], [[192, 201], "Q2763"], [[270, 283], "Q362"], [[303, 317], "Q1166062"], [[420, 426], "Q36"], [[444, 449], "Q39"], [[490, 496], "Q36"], [[533, 544], "Q39"], [[628, 634], "Q1166062"], [[660, 671], "Q39"], [[698, 713], "Unknown"], [[741, 770], "Unknown"], [[802, 808], "Q36"], [[841, 847], "Q36"], [[896, 901], "Q39"], [[954, 960], "Q36"], [[991, 995], "Q7325"], [[1027, 1031], "Q7320"], [[1032, 1038], "Q7318"], [[1063, 1069], "Q36"], [[1085, 1089], "Q7325"], [[1092, 1098], "Q1166062"], [[1179, 1185], "Q270"], [[1190, 1201], "Q39"], [[1221, 1226], "Q39"], [[1268, 1282], "Unknown"], [[1312, 1325], "Q362"], [[1462, 1468], "Q1166062"], [[1476, 1482], "Q1166062"], [[1543, 1554], "Q39"], [[1656, 1667], "Q39"], [[1827, 1833], "Q36"], [[1972, 1978], "Q1166062"], [[2020, 2026], "Q7325"], [[2043, 2048], "Q39"], [[2170, 2179], "Q2763"], [[2207, 2224], "Unknown"], [[2227, 2230], "Q13850128"], [[2288, 2293], "Q39"], [[2323, 2328], "Q39"], [[2397, 2403], "Q7325"], [[2446, 2451], "Q39"], [[2477, 2483], "Q7325"]]}
{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "INTERVIEW-ZYWIEC SEES NO BIG 97 NET RISE . Steven Silber WARSAW 1996-12-06 Polish brewer Zywiec 's 1996 profit slump may last into next year due in part to hefty depreciation charges , but recent high investment should help the firm defend its 10-percent market share , the firm 's chief executive said . Company President Jean van Boxmeer told Reuters in an interview on Friday that the firm , whose net profit fell 77 percent in the first 10 months of 1996 despite a 30-percent rise in sales , might only post slightly better profits in 1997 before having a chance to make a more significant turnaround . So far this year Zywiec , whose full name is Zaklady Piwowarskie w Zywcu SA , has netted six million zlotys on sales of 224 million zlotys . It has produced 1.5 million hectolitres . Van Boxmeer would not say how much higher 1997 profits or market share could be but said sales of leading Polish brewers should rise as the country 's young urban professionals gradually switch from vodka to beer . \" The perspective on growth is such that reasonably we can think that somewhere between 65 and 80 litres per year is certainly reachable , \" van Boxmeer said on Polish per-capita beer consumption , currently around 40 litres . He said the 65-80-litre level could be reached in the next ten years and make Poland , with its 40-million population , Europe 's third largest beer market after Germany and Britain . Van Boxmeer said Poland 's top five brewers , which produce about 55 percent of the country 's beer , could all raise market share as some of the numerous small brewers fall to competition from the large brewers with foreign investors . Zywiec is 31.8-percent owned by Heineken while Carlsberg has the same amount in Okocim . Earlier this year South African Breweries Ltd ( SAB ) bought strategic stakes in the unlisted Lech and Tychy brewers , which together hold more than 20 percent of the market , and Australia 's Brewpole BV has a controlling stake in Poland 's larges t brewery , Elbrewery Company Ltd. ( EB ) . Van Boxmeer said the tough competition had prevented Zywiec from raising prices in line with inflation , which had added to the pressure on the firm 's margins . He said advertising costs would also increase in the fight for market share . But he said the company 's investment of more than $ 100 million already this decade , largely in production , would help position it to compete with such competitors as brewers from the neighbouring Czech Republic . Some analysts say cheaper but high-quality Czech imports could invade Poland once tariffs for CEFTA countries are lifted in 1998 , but van Boxmeer says such a threat might be exaggerated despite the Czech beer market 's overcapacity . \" I think Polish consumers in general are quite proud of their beers -- and I 'm speaking about all the brands -- and as we make good beers ... I think that this fidelity to our beers is a factor which can limit the Czech beers , \" he said . Van Boxmeer said Zywiec had its eye on Okocim , which has said it would start producing Carlsberg beer next year , but that Zywiec 's potential production of Heineken was a medium-term possibility rather than a short-term one . He said his firm would be better off concentrating on its leading brand , Zywiec Full Light , which accounts for 85 percent of sales and is the country 's largest-selling brand . \" You will not win the war of the Polish beer market with imported international brands , \" van Boxmeer said , adding that Heineken would remain an up-market import in Poland . Van Boxmeer also said Zywiec would be boosted by its recent shedding of soft drinks which only accounted for about three percent of the firm 's overall sales and for which 7.6 million zlotys in provisions had already been made . -- Warsaw Newsroom +48 22 653 9700", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 3816], "labels": [[[0, 16], "Unknown"], [[43, 56], "Unknown"], [[57, 63], "Q270"], [[75, 81], "Q36"], [[89, 95], "Unknown"], [[323, 339], "Unknown"], [[345, 352], "Q130879"], [[624, 630], "Unknown"], [[652, 682], "Unknown"], [[790, 801], "Unknown"], [[896, 902], "Q36"], [[1150, 1157], "Unknown"], [[1166, 1172], "Q36"], [[1310, 1316], "Q36"], [[1352, 1358], "Q46"], [[1394, 1401], "Q183"], [[1406, 1413], "Q145"], [[1416, 1427], "Unknown"], [[1433, 1439], "Q36"], [[1653, 1659], "Unknown"], [[1685, 1693], "Q180855"], [[1700, 1709], "Q113215"], [[1733, 1739], "Q2017377"], [[1760, 1787], "Unknown"], [[1790, 1793], "Q7565435"], [[1836, 1840], "Unknown"], [[1845, 1850], "Q11977"], [[1922, 1931], "Q408"], [[1935, 1946], "Unknown"], [[1974, 1980], "Q36"], [[2003, 2025], "Unknown"], [[2028, 2030], "Unknown"], [[2035, 2046], "Unknown"], [[2088, 2094], "Unknown"], [[2475, 2489], "Q213"], [[2535, 2540], "Q213"], [[2562, 2568], "Q36"], [[2586, 2591], "Q319014"], [[2631, 2638], "Unknown"], [[2691, 2696], "Q213"], [[2737, 2743], "Q36"], [[2943, 2948], "Q213"], [[2969, 2980], "Unknown"], [[2986, 2992], "Unknown"], [[3008, 3014], "Unknown"], [[3057, 3066], "Q113215"], [[3093, 3099], "Unknown"], [[3127, 3135], "Q854383"], [[3271, 3277], "Unknown"], [[3278, 3288], "Unknown"], [[3410, 3416], "Q36"], [[3472, 3479], "Unknown"], [[3499, 3507], "Q854383"], [[3544, 3550], "Q36"], [[3553, 3564], "Unknown"], [[3575, 3581], "Unknown"], [[3785, 3800], "Unknown"]]}

Edna Fernandes LONDON 1996-12-06 The British government warned Friday that it would refer the proposed trans-Atlantic alliance between British Airways Plc and American Airlines to Britain 's Monopolies and Mergers Commission unless the carriers complied with a number of conditions . Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang added that even if the conditions were met by both airlines , final clearance would hinge on an open skies deal between Britain and the United States to liberalise trans-Atlantic air traffic , which would create greater competition on the routes . Lang said he supported conditions proposed by Britain 's Office of Fair Trading , which was asked to examine the case last month . \" I agree ... that without suitable undertakings the alliance would be likely to lead to a significant loss of actual and potential passengers , on those routes where BA and AA currently compete and for all passengers on the trans-Atlantic market route between the UK and U.S. , \" he said . His comments came just minutes after the latest set of open skies talks ended in London with no deal signed . Industry sources said there was no new date for fresh talks and blamed the deadlock on uncertainty over whether the British Airways-American deal would be cleared . The conditions for clearance of the alliance were that British Airways and American drop 168 slots at London Heathrow airport , the busiest in Europe . American 's parent , AMR Corp. , said it did not view the terms as a \" deal breaker . \" However , it called the conditions \" more severe \" than those imposed by other regulatory authorities on similar airline alliances . British Airways 's initial response was that \" unconditional divestiture of slots is unprecedented and if done it must be on the basis of fair market value . \" It added that it would be \" prepared to take reasonable steps to assist the introduction of additional competition . \" The government also wants British Airways to drop a clause in its agreement with USAir that bars it from competing on trans-Atlantic routes , and said both British Airways and American should be prepared to reduce services on the London to Dallas-Fort Worth route in the event that a new entrant wishes to enter . It also suggested losing some slots on the London-to-Boston route . The Office of Fair Trade called for British Airways / American to allow third-party access to their joint frequent flyer programme where the applicant does not have access to an equivalent programme .

Brendan Intindola NEW YORK 1996-12-06 Homestake Mining Co tops Wall Street 's list as the most likely white knight buyer for Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corp if Santa Fe rejects unsolicited suitor Newmont Mining Corp . Santa Fe is so far mum on the more than $ 2 billion stock swap takeover proposal from Newmont , announced Thursday . Wall Street , since the bid , has speculated that any deal between Newmont and Santa Fe would be a \" bear hug , \" or a reluctantly negotiated agreement where the buyer is not necessarily a friendly suitor . Newmont said the companies have had previous contact , though declined to detail the encounters . Analysts predict Santa Fe will go to the highest bidder , and that if a rival buyer is found , Newmont may not be able to match its offer . They said the Santa Fe deal , which includes desirable Nevada mining territory , would only payoff for Newmont longer term . Newmont , in fact , will not benefit from the Santa Fe acquisition on an earnings basis for at least two years , which also limits its capacity to raise its offer . Any deal , friendly or hostile , would almost assuredly be a stock swap , which is necessary to preserve the tax-free , pooling-of-interest accounting , they said . Analysts and arbitrageurs immediately ruled out Barrick Gold Corp and Bre-X Minerals Ltd as Santa Fe saviors because they are locked in negotiations over their splitting Indonesia 's Busang vast gold deposit . Placer Dome Inc too was considered unlikley because it is focusing on geographic expansion in areas that do match Santa Fe 's Nevada , South America and Central Asia presence , they said . A Homestake spokesman was not immediately available to comment on speculation that it tops the list . Homestake , based in San Francisco , operates gold mines in the United States , Australia , Chile and Canada . Earnings in 1995 were $ 0.22 per share , or $ 30.3 million , on revenues of $ 746.3 million . Santa Fe is headquartered Albuquerque , N.M. and reported 1995 earnings of $ 0.30 per share , or $ 40 million , on revenues of $ 350 million . Santa Fe has mining and exploration operations in Nevada , California , Montana , Canada , Brazil , Australia , Chile , Kazakstan , Mexico and Ghana . PaineWebber analyst Marc Cohen said he lowered his rating on Newmont to neutral from attractive today because if Newmont merged with Santa Fe , investors would have to wait until the second half of 1998 to realize earnings accretion . \" I think Homestake could come in as a white knight , but how much is someone willing to come in above the Newmont number . One would have to outbid by at least 15 percent , but there is going to be a ( Santa Fe ) deal with someone , \" he said . \" Longer term , two to three years out , ( a Newmont-Santa Fe deal ) is positive , it does all the right things . But in the near-term it is , at worst , neutral , \" the analyst added . Newmont proposed to Santa Fe a stock-swap merger at a ratio of 0.33 Newmont shares for each Santa Fe shares . In Friday New York Stock Exchange trade , Newmonth was off 1/2 to 46-5/8 while Santa Fe added 1/4 to 15-1/8 . \" Newmont said it wants to discuss a friendly deal with Santa Fe , which is almost always a euphemism for ' We have more money in our pocket , ' \" said an arb , referring to a possible sweetened bid from Newmont . Two other arbs called Newmont 's move a \" a 32 cent bid \" because there is no formal tender offer , only the proposal letter \" mailed \" to Santa Fe 's board . -- Wall Street Desk , 212-859-1734 .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 3569], "labels": [[[0, 7], "Unknown"], [[25, 33], "Unknown"], [[43, 60], "Unknown"], [[61, 69], "Q60"], [[81, 100], "Unknown"], [[106, 117], "Q13677"], [[168, 194], "Unknown"], [[198, 206], "Unknown"], [[234, 253], "Unknown"], [[256, 264], "Unknown"], [[342, 349], "Q1785405"], [[373, 384], "Q13677"], [[440, 447], "Q1785405"], [[452, 460], "Unknown"], [[580, 587], "Q1785405"], [[695, 703], "Unknown"], [[773, 780], "Q1785405"], [[832, 840], "Unknown"], [[873, 879], "Q1227"], [[921, 928], "Q1785405"], [[943, 950], "Q1785405"], [[989, 997], "Unknown"], [[1321, 1338], "Unknown"], [[1343, 1361], "Unknown"], [[1365, 1373], "Unknown"], [[1443, 1452], "Q252"], [[1456, 1462], "Unknown"], [[1483, 1498], "Unknown"], [[1597, 1605], "Unknown"], [[1609, 1615], "Q1227"], [[1618, 1631], "Q18"], [[1636, 1648], "Q27275"], [[1674, 1683], "Unknown"], [[1774, 1783], "Unknown"], [[1795, 1808], "Q62"], [[1838, 1851], "Q30"], [[1854, 1863], "Q408"], [[1866, 1871], "Q298"], [[1876, 1882], "Q16"], [[1979, 1987], "Unknown"], [[2005, 2016], "Q34804"], [[2019, 2023], "Q1522"], [[2122, 2130], "Unknown"], [[2172, 2178], "Q1227"], [[2181, 2191], "Q99"], [[2194, 2201], "Q1212"], [[2204, 2210], "Q16"], [[2213, 2219], "Q155"], [[2222, 2231], "Q408"], [[2234, 2239], "Q298"], [[2242, 2251], "Q232"], [[2254, 2260], "Q1489"], [[2265, 2270], "Q117"], [[2273, 2284], "Q7124874"], [[2293, 2303], "Unknown"], [[2334, 2341], "Q1785405"], [[2386, 2393], "Q1785405"], [[2406, 2414], "Unknown"], [[2518, 2527], "Unknown"], [[2615, 2622], "Q1785405"], [[2711, 2719], "Unknown"], [[2799, 2815], "Unknown"], [[2940, 2947], "Q1785405"], [[2960, 2968], "Unknown"], [[3008, 3015], "Q1785405"], [[3032, 3040], "Unknown"], [[3060, 3083], "Q13677"], [[3092, 3100], "Unknown"], [[3129, 3137], "Unknown"], [[3162, 3169], "Q1785405"], [[3216, 3224], "Unknown"], [[3364, 3371], "Q1785405"], [[3396, 3403], "Q1785405"], [[3513, 3521], "Unknown"], [[3536, 3552], "Unknown"]]}

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "Multinational commander going back to east Zaire . Jonathan Wright NAIROBI 1996-12-06 The Canadian general in charge of a multinational force for eastern Zaire said on Friday he was going back to Zaire for more information about the plight of about 165,000 Rwandan refugees adrift in the countryside . Lieutenant-General Maurice Baril told a news conference in Nairobi his main concern was for a large group of about 150,000 refugees living off the land in a valley about 65 km ( 40 miles ) west of the eastern city of Goma . If he decided it was necessary and safe for the aircrew , he would not hesitate to order airdrops of food for the refugees , even against the wishes of the government in Kinshasa and the Zairean rebels who control much of eastern Zaire , he said . \" Tomorrow I 'm going into Rwanda and my intention is to go across into eastern Zaire and try to find out for the second time what the situation is on the ground , \" he said . General Baril saw rebel leader Laurent Kabila in Goma last week but the rebels told him the crisis was over because most of the Rwandan refugees have already gone home . The rebels do not want the multinational force to deploy on the ground , for fear it might help the Zairean army regain control of the area . Kinshasa opposes airdrops , apparently because the food could fall into the hands of the rebels and their local supporters . Canadian Defence Minister Doug Young said on Thursday that the multinational force would probably not have to make food airdrops or intervene militarily in any major way . \" It does n't look as though they ( airdrops ) are going to be required in any significant way because the NGOs ( non-governmental organisations ) are in that area on the border between Zaire and Rwanda , \" Young told reporters . But General Baril said it would be premature to rule out any course of action until he had more information . \" We hope that if the front moves forward or stabilises then we will have access ( to the large group of refugees ) with reconnaissance or humanitarian agencies . \" If they ca n't move because they are too weak , then we will probably consider very seriously using air delivery means ( airdrops ) ...It 's complex , it 's dangerous for the air crew that fly in there and it will have to be absolutely necessary . If it is necessary , I wo n't hesitate to use it , \" he said . Asked if he would disregard the objections of the Zairean government , he said : \" It would have to be in the last resort . It would have to mean that tens of thousands of lives are in danger . Do you think that I would have a conscience problem doing it or not at that time ? And my mandate is also under Chapter Seven to operate in eastern Zaire . \" Under Chapter Seven of the U.N. charter , the Security Council has wide powers to preserve peace and security . \" I know their ( the Zairean government 's ) position and I know it 's very delicate and we are very sensitive to their position also , \" the general added . He denied that his contacts , criticised by Kinshasa , with the Zairean rebels amounted to negotiations . \" I do n't negotiate , \" he said . \" I coordinate with those who are holding ground and that 's a wise thing to do . When we do n't know where the front is , we do n't know what the risk is . \" Baril said that apart from the group of 150,000 , U.S. and British reconnaissance plans had tracked two much smaller groups of refugees -- one of up to 1,000 north of the town of Masisi and one of up to 8,000 on the road from Bukavu west to Kindu . The Kisangani office of the medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres said on Friday that more than 100,000 refugees were trekking northwest from the Goma-Bukavu area and many of them were now in the town of Walikale .

Raphael Kopessoua BANGUI 1996-12-06 A former cabinet minister in Central African Republic and his son were abducted from their home and murdered in growing ethnic violence in the capital Bangui , a government minister said on Friday . With violence spiralling out of control , France voiced backing for the elected Bangui government but said its troops based in the former colony under defence pacts would not help it combat army mutineers . \" France cannot be involved in the domestic political debate , \" President Jacques Chirac told a news conference at the end of a Franco-African summit in Burkina Faso . \" French troops may only take part in maintaining order to avoid major abuses and protect foreign communities , \" he said . Public Service Minister David Dofara , who is the head of the national Red Cross , told Reuters he had seen the bodies of former interior minister Christophe Grelombe and his son , who was not named . Witnesses said they had been seized by troops loyal to President Ange-Felix Patasse at dawn on Thursday when they clashed with soldiers staging a mutiny since November 16 . Grelombe is from the Yakoma tribe to which most of the rebel soldiers belong . The uprising began over pay demands but has turned into a campaign to topple Patasse , sparking ethnic violence and dividing the capital . The former minister and his son had been taken from their home close to the presidential palace , which is guarded by loyalist soldiers backed by French troops based in Bangui . The bodies were found on Thursday in an open field about two km ( one mile ) further away , said Dofora and other witnesses . The men were seized as loyalist forces and French troops fought gunbattles with mutineers who fired rockets into the city centre . A French-owned hotel was slightly damaged . Yakomas are hounded in stronghold districts of Patasse 's Baya people while other tribes have fled areas in rebel hands . Roadblocks have been erected in city districts while central Bangui , which is patrolled by French troops with tanks , is deserted . Shops and businesses have remained shut this week . The Franco-African summit decided to send a mission Bangui to seek ways of containing the mutiny and a threat of civil war . Chirac said Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore would visit Bangui \" in the coming hours \" with the heads of state of Gabon , Mali and Chad to try and establish dialogue between authorities and rebels . The mutiny forced Patasse to miss the summit . His spokesman had predicted the meeting to send an assessment mission . Patasse , who won Central Africa 's first multi-party elections , refuses to resign . Church-led meadiation attempts hit deadlock over rebel demands for his departure . Soldiers staged mutinies in April and May , with French troops stepping in with tanks and helicopters to quell the more serious second uprising . Patasse offered concessions and amnesty to rebels before the May rebellion ended after rebels looted the city centre . Rebels accuse Patasse of tribalism and of arming his civilian supporters and hired guns from Sudan and Chad . Mutineers have vowed to disarm all civilians and to chase out the foreign forces knwon as Codos . Hospital sources and witnesses said about 10 people were known to have been killed in the more than two weeks of fighting , including two rebels killed in Thursday 's clashes . An undetermined number of people are reported to have been abducted and killed outside the town by tribal vigilante groups . In Thursday 's fighting , French troops fired back as mutineers trying to break out of their strongholds rained mortar shells on the city centre .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 3705], "labels": [[[28, 42], "Q929"], [[52, 69], "Unknown"], [[70, 76], "Q3832"], [[117, 141], "Q929"], [[239, 245], "Q3832"], [[329, 335], "Q142"], [[367, 373], "Q3832"], [[496, 502], "Q142"], [[569, 583], "Q2105"], [[623, 637], "Unknown"], [[648, 660], "Q965"], [[665, 671], "Q142"], [[811, 823], "Unknown"], [[858, 867], "Unknown"], [[875, 882], "Q130879"], [[934, 953], "Unknown"], [[1053, 1071], "Q314524"], [[1161, 1169], "Unknown"], [[1182, 1188], "Q1165330"], [[1317, 1324], "Unknown"], [[1525, 1531], "Q142"], [[1548, 1554], "Q3832"], [[1654, 1660], "Unknown"], [[1726, 1732], "Q142"], [[1816, 1828], "Unknown"], [[1858, 1865], "Unknown"], [[1905, 1912], "Unknown"], [[1916, 1920], "Unknown"], [[2041, 2047], "Q3832"], [[2072, 2078], "Q142"], [[2169, 2183], "Unknown"], [[2217, 2223], "Q3832"], [[2290, 2296], "Q2105"], [[2302, 2314], "Q965"], [[2325, 2340], "Q57324"], [[2353, 2359], "Q3832"], [[2411, 2416], "Q1000"], [[2419, 2423], "Q912"], [[2428, 2432], "Unknown"], [[2514, 2521], "Unknown"], [[2615, 2622], "Unknown"], [[2633, 2647], "Q929"], [[2833, 2839], "Q142"], [[2930, 2937], "Unknown"], [[3063, 3070], "Unknown"], [[3142, 3147], "Q1049"], [[3152, 3156], "Unknown"], [[3249, 3254], "Q5140350"], [[3585, 3591], "Q142"]]}

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "Plastic surgery gets boost in Brazil . Simona de Logu RIO DE JANEIRO 1996-12-06 Plastic surgery is booming , especially among men , as Brazilians spend much of their new-found wealth on the latest beauty treatments , said the organisers of a four-day international plastic surgery conference that opened on Friday . The number of plastic surgeries in Brazil has jumped 30 percent to an estimated 150,000 this year since an anti-inflation plan was introduced in July 1994 , Farid Hakme , the president of the Brazilian Plastic Surgery Society ( SBCP ) , said . The number of operations on men increased even more -- by 80 percent , from 8,000 in 1994 to 15,000 in 1995 , he said . \" Brazil ranks right at the top for plastic surgery with respect to the number of surgeons , the number of patients , number of operations , number of conferences . Our statistics are the highest for everything , \" Hakme said . \" We believe the increase in plastic surgeries for men results from the difficulties in the job market . People need to have a more youthful look to compete in the job market , given the profound changes in Latin America 's economy . \" A controlled exchange rate , trade liberalisation and tight monetary policies have also dramatically curbed inflation , making more money available for cosmetic surgery . Brazil has been at the forefront in plastic surgery for decades and is home to one of the most famous surgeons , Ivo Pitangy . There are 6,000 plastic surgeons there , of which 4,500 have qualified to be members of the SBCP . Every year , 500 new plastic surgeons graduate in Brazil and medical students from all over the world come to study there . Hakme attributes Brazil 's fascination with plastic surgery not to excessive vanity but to the country 's mix and match of different races , which can create physical disharmonies . \" What happens is the nose sometimes does n't match the mouth or the buttocks do n't match with the legs , \" he said . Brazil 's most sought-after beauty treatment is liposuction in which fat is sucked away from areas of the body , with about 30,000 operations a year at a cost of $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 each . Stomach tucks and breast operations are also popular since the tropical climate calls for flesh-baring fashions , but unlike women elsewhere Brazilians tend to have breast reductions and buttock implants . \" The women who want to reduce their breasts here would probably want to increase them in the United States , \" SBCP Vice-President Oswaldo Saldanha said . \" Beauty ideals and cultures are different in every country . \" Plastic surgery scares like the case in which Brazilian model Claudia Liz fell into a coma after being anaesthetised for a liposuction in October are not much of a deterrent . Saldanha said operations fell 30 percent immediately after that case but the rate was back to normal now .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 2862], "labels": [[[30, 36], "Q155"], [[39, 53], "Unknown"], [[54, 68], "Q8678"], [[135, 145], "Q155"], [[351, 357], "Q155"], [[473, 484], "Unknown"], [[508, 541], "Unknown"], [[544, 548], "Unknown"], [[682, 688], "Q155"], [[895, 900], "Unknown"], [[1115, 1128], "Q12585"], [[1315, 1321], "Q155"], [[1428, 1439], "Unknown"], [[1534, 1538], "Unknown"], [[1591, 1597], "Q155"], [[1665, 1670], "Unknown"], [[1682, 1688], "Q155"], [[1966, 1972], "Q155"], [[2295, 2305], "Q155"], [[2454, 2467], "Q30"], [[2472, 2476], "Unknown"], [[2492, 2508], "Unknown"], [[2626, 2635], "Q155"], [[2642, 2653], "Unknown"], [[2756, 2764], "Unknown"]]}

On Tuesday and Wednesday , opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi was restricted to her home by the military government to prevent her from being drawn into the protests . She was allowed to move freely on Thursday . The protest culminated at dawn on Tuesday with several hundred students being detained briefly by police in central Rangoon . The street protests were the biggest seen in the capital since the student-led pro-democracry demonstrations of September 1988 when the junta crushed the uprising . Thousands were killed or imprisoned . Earlier on Friday some of the students , who were held briefly by police during the protests earlier this week , said they were still dissatisfied with the military government . They told Reuters they were unhappy that the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council ( SLORC ) had not heeded their calls for the right to organise independent unions on campus . \" We still want government answers to our demands . We want police punishment to be published in newspapers , \" one student said . But the students stressed their protests were non-political and they had no contact with Suu Kyi 's National League for Democracy ( NLD ) . Suu Kyi , a Nobel laureate and daughter of independence hero Aung San , and key NLD officials have also denied any link with the students . But they have said both parties had a \" moral link \" in that they were against police brutality and injustice .

SINGAPORE 1996-12-06 International trade union leaders on Friday expressed outrage that the head of the International Labour Organisation ( ILO ) had been barred from speaking at next week 's WTO meeting in Singapore . Bill Jordan , general secretary of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions ( ICFTU ) , told a news conference the withdrawal of a WTO invitation to ILO director general Michel Hansenne was \" outrageous behaviour on the part of an organisation that wants to command respect in the world \" . Jordan said a small group of developing nations that oppose linking trade talks and labour conditions had pressured World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) officials to prevent Hansenne from taking the platform to urge such links . \" It is to their shame that those who are responsible for encouraging this meeting responded ( to the pressure ) in silencing him , \" Jordan said after the opening of an ICFTU conference on international labour standards and trade . The three-day trade union conference in Singapore hopes to push labour issues onto the WTO agenda . Jordan said the WTO 's credibility was at stake over the issue of trade and labour . The ICFTU said it wanted the WTO conference beginning on Monday to outlaw forced and child labour , end discrimination in hiring , and guarantee the right to join a union . Bill Brett , chairman of the ILO Workers Group , told Reuters before the news conference he was \" not too surprised , but very disappointed \" that the speaking invitation had been withdrawn . \" Some governments are very determined to stop the issue ( of trade and labour rights ) being discussed , \" he said , adding that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) seemed particularly hostile to the ILO agenda . ASEAN groups Brunei , Indonesia , Malaysia , the Philippines , Singapore , Thailand and Vietnam . The ILO wants a trade and labour rights \" social clause \" included in the final ministerial statement issued by WTO leaders at the end of the meeting , the organization 's first ministerial-level gathering . Speaking to ICFTU delegates , Richard Eglin , director of the WTO secretariat , said the WTO was capable of making a significant contribution to governmental efforts to solve social problems . But he said the WTO 's organisational structure made it difficult to impose on its members a social clause such as that called for by the ILO .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 2452], "labels": [[[26, 29], "Q7825"], [[38, 41], "Q54129"], [[49, 58], "Q334"], [[153, 186], "Q54129"], [[189, 192], "Q54129"], [[241, 244], "Q7825"], [[256, 265], "Q334"], [[268, 279], "Q1482196"], [[307, 355], "Q1138589"], [[358, 363], "Q1138589"], [[411, 414], "Q7825"], [[429, 432], "Q54129"], [[450, 465], "Q2648073"], [[571, 577], "Unknown"], [[687, 711], "Q7825"], [[714, 717], "Q7825"], [[930, 936], "Unknown"], [[966, 971], "Q1138589"], [[1069, 1078], "Q334"], [[1116, 1119], "Q7825"], [[1129, 1135], "Unknown"], [[1145, 1148], "Q7825"], [[1218, 1223], "Q1138589"], [[1243, 1246], "Q7825"], [[1387, 1397], "Unknown"], [[1416, 1433], "Unknown"], [[1441, 1448], "Q130879"], [[1713, 1751], "Q7768"], [[1754, 1759], "Q7768"], [[1797, 1800], "Q54129"], [[1810, 1815], "Q7768"], [[1823, 1829], "Q921"], [[1832, 1841], "Q252"], [[1844, 1852], "Q833"], [[1859, 1870], "Q928"], [[1873, 1882], "Q334"], [[1885, 1893], "Q869"], [[1898, 1905], "Q881"], [[1912, 1915], "Q54129"], [[2020, 2023], "Q7825"], [[2128, 2133], "Q1138589"], [[2146, 2159], "Unknown"], [[2178, 2181], "Q7825"], [[2205, 2208], "Q7825"], [[2325, 2328], "Q7825"], [[2447, 2450], "Q54129"]]}

SINGAPORE 1996-12-06 Indian rubber demand is seen outpacing local production in the 1996/97 April / March season and the trend will persist way into the next century , the chairman of the Rubber Board of India said on Friday . K.J. Matthew said at the Asia Rubber Markets meeting here Indian production of natural rubber in 1996/97 will reach 547,000 tonnes against projected demand of 578,000 tonnes , a gap of 31,000 tonnes . For synthetic rubber , production reached 68,200 tonnes in 1995/96 while consumption in the same season hit 134,085 tonnes , Matthew added . \" Though schemes designed to realise further increases in the production of natural rubber are being operated successfully , the demand-supply gap is expected to widen , \" he said . Indian synthetic rubber output is not expected to rise significantly in the next season but demand will rise to 145,000 tonnes . Matthew estimates that by the 2000/01 season , the gap between natural rubber output and consumption will rise to 51,000 tonnes and 319,000 tonnes in 2010/11 . Natural rubber production will go up to 695,000 tonnes in 2000/01 against consumption of 746,000 tonnes . In 2010/11 , domestic demand should rise further to 1.233 million tonnes while production will only reach about 914,000 tonnes . One way to bridge the widening gap is to put more land under cultivation which the Rubber Board official estimates will reach 220,000 hectares between now and the year 2003 although Matthew said this may not be possible at this time in India . \" The development objective for the rubber plantation industry will be to increase production to the best extent possibly with a view to minimising imports of natural rubber , \" he said . -- Singapore Newsroom ( 65-8703305 )", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 1795], "labels": [[[0, 6], "Q668"], [[52, 61], "Q334"], [[73, 79], "Q668"], [[240, 261], "Unknown"], [[279, 291], "Unknown"], [[304, 331], "Unknown"], [[337, 343], "Q668"], [[605, 612], "Unknown"], [[803, 809], "Q668"], [[932, 939], "Unknown"], [[1410, 1422], "Q7375801"], [[1509, 1516], "Unknown"], [[1563, 1568], "Q668"], [[1762, 1780], "Unknown"]]}

George Nishiyama TOKYO 1996-12-06 Comments by Japan 's tight-lipped central bank chief and an influential top bureaucrat are further signs that the nation 's authorities want to keep the dollar at current levels , market sources said on Friday . In a rare expression of a view on currencies by the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) governor , Yasuo Matsushita was quoted in Japan 's leading economic daily on Friday as saying that he sees no further , immediate fall in the yen . This followed a widely watched television appearance late on Thursday by Eisuke Sakakibara , a high-ranking Finance Ministry official , who denied he had said he wants to guide the dollar lower to between 108 and 110 yen . But many in the market thought Sakakibara 's real intentions lay elsewhere , and took more notice of his comments about the U.S. government 's stance on the dollar , dealers said . \" I think his views on ( U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert ) Rubin 's comments were indeed what he himself thinks about the dollar , \" said Hank Note , chief dealer at Sumitomo Bank . Asked about Rubin 's comment that a strong dollar was in U.S. interests , Sakakibara said the remark does not necessarily mean the United States supports a stronger dollar . \" It 's a strong dollar , not stronger . In that sense , the comments are not pointing to a certain direction , \" he said . \" It shows that Sakakibara is not for a stronger dollar either , \" said Sumitomo 's Note . Takao Sakoh , first vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland in Tokyo , said : \" Maybe a dollar at 104.50 yen is not acceptable ( to Sakakibara ) , but it may be okay at the current level , at the lower end of 112 yen . \" Market participants have kept a close eye on Sakakibara , chief of the ministry 's International Finance Bureau , as a comment he made in November after the dollar hit this year 's high of 114.92 yen pushed the currency down sharply . He had said then that the market 's view on Japan 's economy was too pessimistic and that he believed it was stronger than the market thought . Dealers have come to refer to 115 yen as the \" Sakakibara ceiling \" for the dollar following the remark . Adding to the comments by \" Mr Yen \" , as Sakakibara is known for his prominence in the currency market , was BOJ governor Matsushita 's remark . \" The recent level of the yen exchange rate has been stable , and it does not appear to be moving towards a further depreciation of the yen immediately , so import prices are likely to stabilise at current levels , \" Matsushita said in an interview with the Nihon Keizai Shimbun . \" The fact that he touched on the issue of inflation triggered by import prices shows that the BOJ does not want a further depreciation of the yen , past 115 yen , \" said Yasuhito Kawashima , chief forex manager at Toyo Trust & Banking Co . Some said the central bank may have been concerned a weaker yen would lead to unfounded pessimism about Japan 's economy . \" There was concern that foreign investors may sell Japanese stocks if the dollar goes above 115 yen . The BOJ does not want the yen 's weakness to lead to pessimism over the economy , \" said Taisuke Tanaka , market strategist with Credit Suisse in Tokyo . Senior BOJ officials have separately said financial markets ' views on the economy have been too negative . \" I realise there are negative views in the markets about the impact of the consumption tax hike and drop in public spending , but the markets appear to be exaggerating the magnitude of the negative impact , \" a senior BOJ official told Reuters on Friday .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "Lebanon sentences pro-Israeli warlord to death . Haitham Haddadin BEIRUT 1996-12-06 A Lebanese military court on Friday sentenced to death in absentia the commander of Israel 's surrogate militia in south Lebanon on treason charges . The court convicted General Antoine Lahd , head of the South Lebanon Army ( SLA ) , of collaborating with Israel with which Lebanon is officially at war . Lahd , a 69-year-old former Lebanese army major-general , heads the 3,000-strong SLA militia which helps Israel hold a border zone in south Lebanon to ward off cross-frontier guerrilla raids on northern Israel . Lahd said a few days after the trial began on February 16 that Lebanese authorities must drop the charges or risk blocking any peace deal with the Jewish state . He said Israel was capable of pressuring Lebanon 's Syrian-backed government to stop the legal pursuit . The charges against Lahd were : forming a hostile army , carrying weapons on Israel 's side , helping Israel strip off a part of Lebanese territory by violence , forming an armed gang , killing or trying to kill Lebanese civilians by artillery shelling and kidnapping Lebanese citizens for long periods . Shortly before Lahd 's trial began , a Beirut military prosecutor charged another 89 former Lebanese army soldiers with collaborating with Israel . No date has been set for the trial of the men , all members of the SLA living in the Israeli-held zone in south Lebanon . Israel and Lahd have repeatedly demanded safety guarantees for the SLA -- a mixed Christian-Shi'ite Moslem force -- which the Jewish states regards as loyal allies . Israel has said the Lebanese army must incorporate the SLA fighters into its ranks as an army brigade as a condition for peace . But Lebanese political analysts have said that would be out of the question and Lebanese authorities pre-empted the issue by taking legal action against Lahd . Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres , calling Lahd \" a great Lebanese patriot \" , said earlier this year Lebanon had insulted the SLA commander by ordering his arrest on the treason charges . Peres , who was ousted in May by rightwing Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu , said there could not be real negotiations with Lebanon \" unless it will stop the maltreatment of the SLA and its commanders . \" The Beirut military court also sentenced to life in jail in absentia Etian Saqr , former head of the pro-Israeli Guardians of the Cedars , a small rightwing Christian civil war militia . Saqr , whose trial was concurrent with Lahd 's , was convicted of \" contacting the Israeli enemy , passing information to Israel and undertaking hostile acts against Lebanon \" .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 2668], "labels": [[[0, 7], "Q822"], [[18, 29], "Unknown"], [[49, 65], "Unknown"], [[66, 72], "Q3820"], [[86, 94], "Q822"], [[168, 174], "Q801"], [[205, 212], "Q822"], [[262, 274], "Q586575"], [[289, 307], "Q929554"], [[310, 313], "Q929554"], [[340, 346], "Q801"], [[358, 365], "Q822"], [[389, 393], "Unknown"], [[417, 425], "Q822"], [[470, 473], "Q929554"], [[494, 500], "Q801"], [[529, 536], "Q822"], [[592, 598], "Q801"], [[601, 605], "Unknown"], [[664, 672], "Q822"], [[748, 754], "Q7325"], [[771, 777], "Q801"], [[804, 811], "Q822"], [[815, 828], "Unknown"], [[888, 892], "Unknown"], [[945, 951], "Q801"], [[970, 976], "Q801"], [[997, 1005], "Q822"], [[1080, 1088], "Q822"], [[1136, 1144], "Q822"], [[1188, 1192], "Unknown"], [[1212, 1218], "Q3820"], [[1265, 1273], "Q822"], [[1312, 1318], "Q801"], [[1388, 1391], "Q929554"], [[1406, 1418], "Unknown"], [[1433, 1440], "Q822"], [[1443, 1449], "Q801"], [[1454, 1458], "Unknown"], [[1510, 1513], "Q929554"], [[1525, 1542], "Unknown"], [[1543, 1549], "Q432"], [[1569, 1575], "Q7325"], [[1609, 1615], "Q801"], [[1629, 1637], "Q822"], [[1664, 1667], "Q929554"], [[1742, 1750], "Q822"], [[1818, 1826], "Q822"], [[1891, 1895], "Unknown"], [[1905, 1912], "Q801"], [[1928, 1940], "Q57410"], [[1951, 1955], "Unknown"], [[1966, 1974], "Q822"], [[2010, 2017], "Q822"], [[2035, 2038], "Q929554"], [[2097, 2102], "Q57410"], [[2140, 2147], "Q801"], [[2155, 2173], "Q43723"], [[2223, 2230], "Q822"], [[2277, 2280], "Q929554"], [[2308, 2314], "Q3820"], [[2373, 2383], "Unknown"], [[2405, 2416], "Unknown"], [[2417, 2440], "Q798186"], [[2461, 2470], "Q1841"], [[2491, 2495], "Q2700625"], [[2530, 2534], "Unknown"], [[2574, 2581], "Q801"], [[2613, 2619], "Q801"], [[2657, 2664], "Q822"]]}

As Glenn Lawhon , a rural Florida minister who is the victim 's father , looked on , Mills was pronounced dead at 7:13 a.m. EST ( 1213 GMT ) for the murder of Lester Lawhon . Speaking in Arabic , Mills made a final statement before an anonymous citizen flipped the switch that sent 2000 volts of electricity through his body , said Department of Corrections spokesman Eugene Morris , who was present at the execution . \" I bear witness that there is no God but Allah and I bear witness that the prophet Mohammed is the messenger of God , \" he quoted Mills as saying . Prison officials said they had no record of Mills ' official conversion , but they said that , on May 14 , 1991 , he had asked that a new name , Yuhanna Abdullah Muhammed , be added to his prison file , which is usually an indication of a conversion to Islam . Mills is the 38th person to die in Florida 's electric chair since the U.S. Supreme Court reversed itself in 1976 and legalised the death penalty .

He also estimated that only 25 percent of bites were reported because medical attention was not needed .

The five breeds credited with the most incidents were chow chows , Rottweilers , German shepherds , cocker spaniels and Dalmatians . \" The trends in dog bites by particular breeds have more to do with fad pets owned by individuals who need to have something unique .

' Mohammed Rashid \" is a terrorist who deserves to be behind bars . It is inexplicable to us why he would have been allowed to leave Greece before serving his just sentence ...

He spoke after Rashid left Greece Thursday on being freed from prison early for good behaviour after serving 8-1/2 years . The Clinton administration 's strong views on this subject have been conveyed to the Greek government , Burns said . Mahammad Rashid was whisked from Korydallos maximum security prison just outside Athens to the airport where he boarded a regular Olympic Airways flight to Cairo where he would transit to Tunis and the former Palestine Liberation Organisation headquarters . Rashid , 46 , was sentenced to 18 years in prison by a Greek court in 1992 after being convicted of premeditated murder in the mid-air bombing of a Pan American airliner in 1982 . His sentence had been reduced to 15 years in 1993 . A parole court ruled recently that Rashid could be freed after serving 8-1/2 years , with time in pre-trial detention counted towards his term , but said he must be expelled immediately from Greece . The United States accuses Rashid of belonging to the May 15 Palestinian guerrilla group and being an accomplished student of master Palestinian bombmaker Abu Ibrahim . Three FBI agents who testified against Rashid during the trial , held at Korydallos prison , said they had ample evidence against Rashid for a bomb planted on a Pan American plane in Brazil in 1982 and a mid-air bomb blast on a TWA airliner approaching Athens in 1986 which killed four U.S. citizens .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 2179], "labels": [[[0, 4], "Q30"], [[42, 52], "Q61"], [[68, 81], "Q30"], [[118, 123], "Q41"], [[136, 147], "Q219060"], [[463, 479], "Q789915"], [[490, 504], "Q519825"], [[514, 529], "Unknown"], [[645, 651], "Q41"], [[751, 756], "Q519825"], [[795, 801], "Unknown"], [[807, 813], "Q41"], [[907, 914], "Q1124"], [[988, 993], "Q41"], [[1007, 1012], "Q519825"], [[1020, 1035], "Unknown"], [[1053, 1063], "Unknown"], [[1101, 1107], "Q1524"], [[1150, 1165], "Q2021591"], [[1176, 1181], "Q85"], [[1208, 1213], "Q3572"], [[1229, 1262], "Unknown"], [[1278, 1284], "Unknown"], [[1333, 1338], "Q41"], [[1426, 1438], "Q8681"], [[1545, 1551], "Unknown"], [[1701, 1707], "Q41"], [[1714, 1727], "Q30"], [[1736, 1742], "Unknown"], [[1770, 1781], "Q219060"], [[1842, 1853], "Q219060"], [[1864, 1875], "Unknown"], [[1884, 1887], "Q8333"], [[1917, 1923], "Unknown"], [[1951, 1961], "Unknown"], [[2008, 2014], "Unknown"], [[2039, 2051], "Q8681"], [[2061, 2067], "Q155"], [[2106, 2109], "Q527341"], [[2131, 2137], "Q1524"], [[2164, 2168], "Q30"]]}

Elif Kaban GENEVA 1996-12-06 In a gloomy Geneva conference centre built before the dawn of the Internet , groups of staid officials made a first stab on Friday at rewriting copyright laws for the digital age . But critics at the first government-level meeting to revise copyright laws in 25 years said the officials and legislators might as well be trying to police the ether . After four days of diplomatic wrangling over procedures , some 600 delegates from nations small and large got down to the nitty-gritty of setting the digital agenda for the first time . Cyberspace squabbles overshadowed the debate on a stack of proposals covering literary and artistic works , the rights of performers and producers of music and producers of databases . \" If it goes on like this , we wo n't have enough time to finish all the discussions , \" a frustrated Western delegate said . \" They announced they will start evening sessions next week . \" Attempts by copyright-based industries to ensure they get a cut from online works led to a storm of protests by Internet companies and critics who say the pacts would curb public access to online information from soccer results to stock prices . \" It 's not illegal to make photocopies of newspaper articles . It 's fair use . We can read sports statistics or stock prices . But with the treaty , this kind of fact will be owned and subject to licensing , \" said James Love , a consumer lobbyist heading the Washington-based Consumer Project on Technology . \" None of the treaties are ready to move . These people do n't understand what they 're doing . \" At stake are billions of dollars and the future of the electronic information industry -- the coming medium for the distribution of music , films , literature , software and commerce . Supporters of the three pacts say they are only an extension of existing intellectual property rights , covered by the century-old Berne Convention . But an array of opponents from the network industry to consumer , scientific and academic groups say the pacts will give sweeping powers to entertainment and copyright-based industries . A quick survey at the conference centre found few officials who had actually surfed the Internet . Mongolia 's state copyright official , Gundegma Jargalshaihan , said apologetically that he had just arrived from Ulan Bator and was not aware of the details of the digital agenda . \" We do n't have money for Internet in Mongolia , \" he added . Alexander Bavykin , deputy legal chief at Russia 's foreign ministry , said Moscow had yet to formulate a policy on copyright in cybersppace . He too had never browsed the Net . \" I 've never tried it and why should I ? There are lots of other things in this life I have n't tried either , \" he said .

Because they do n't understand technology , they fear the unknown . \" Before the Internet , those whose business was to protect copyrights knew where they stood . Their enemies were tangible if elusive , such as the people who pirated music cassettes .

Arasu JAKARTA 1996-12-06 Canada 's Bre-X Minerals Ltd and Barrick Gold Corp are to continue negotiations to hammer out a partnership agreement to develop the spectacular Busang gold find in Indonesia , sources close to the talks said on Friday . \" The negotiations will be held both in Toronto and in Jakarta , \" one source , speaking on condition of anonymity , told Reuters . Another source said most of the key negotiators from both Bre-X and Barrick had returned to Toronto , but declined to say if there had been any progress in their negotiations . Both sources said Bre-X and Barrick did not hold talks on Thursday with Mines and Energy Ministry Secretary-General Umar Said , who is coordinating the negotiations over the Busang find in East Kalimantan . The first source also said Bre-X had until December 21 to submit to the Indonesian Mines and Energy Ministry a feasibility study on the central region of the Busang property , estimated to contain 2.6 million ounces of gold . The richest parts of the property to the north and south of the central region have been estimated by Bre-X to contain 57 million ounces of gold . \" Bre-X is expected to complete the feasibility report by December 16 and submit it to the government before the December 21 deadline , \" the source said . He said Bre-X would then formally seek the permission of the Indonesian government to begin construction to develop Busang 's central region , which might take up to two years . The source declined to say if there had been any progress in the talks between Bre-X and Barrick . \" This is a huge project ... we are not selling furniture , and Bre-X has 13,000 shareholders to answer to , \" the source said . \" While there has been some agreement in principle on some issues , there are still others such as procedures and mechanisms that needed to be sorted out , \" he added . The source said no new deadline had been set by the Mines and Energy Ministry for Bre-X and Barrick to strike a deal . The Ministry had given the companies until December 4 to complete a partnership deal , and advised Bre-X to take a 25 percent stake and Barrick 75 percent to develop the property . \" As far as I am aware , there 's been no new deadline , \" the source said . The Ministry 's Umar said on Thursday that both Bre-X and Barrick had responded positively to a government letter recommending a 25-75 split in the Busang gold property . The government also wants 10 percent of the property . Umar said the government had yet to receive a formal reply from the companies . He had said earlier that if the two companies failed to reach a partnership agreement , the government would explore other ways to expedite development of the Busang find . Bre-X has a partnership deal with PT Panutan Duta of the Panutan Group run by President Suharto 's eldest son , Sigit Harjojudanto , under which Panutan would receive $ 40 million over 40 months plus a 10 percent stake Busang 's richest parts .

{"id": -1, "title": "", "text": "FEATURE - Singapore sees prestige in hosting WTO . Ramthan Hussain SINGAPORE 1996-12-06 Singapore 's winning campaign to host the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) 's first ministerial meeting reflected its ambition to play a key role in shaping global free trade , the lifeblood of its economy , analysts said . \" As one of the world 's most externally oriented economies , Singapore has a disproportionately large stake in the WTO , \" said Desmond Supple , economist at research house I.D.E.A . \" Singapore stands to benefit more than most from continued global trade liberalisation as trade is the engine of its growth , accounting for nearly three times its gross domestic product . \" The city-state met U.S. opposition two years ago in its bid to host the meeting , expected to gather 4,000 officials from 160 countries from December 9 to 13 . In a stand some analysts linked to controversy over Singapore 's caning of an American teenager for vandalism , then-U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor had said the meeting ought to be held where the WTO was going to be headquartered . That would have meant Geneva . But Singapore had the support of other WTO members . Derek da Cunha , senior fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies ( ISEAS ) , said Singapore 's hosting of the conference \" carries a great deal of symbolism for the city-state , underscoring its commitment to free trade and its trading links across the globe . \" There is the international prestige Singapore would enjoy , but \" more importantly there is a genuine national interest in fostering better global free trade and an open market \" , said Tan Kong Yam , head of Business Policy at the National University of Singapore . At the ministerial meeting , trade ministers will review the work of the WTO and the implementation of the Uruguay Round free trade commitments under its predecessor the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) . In June , the WTO hailed Singapore for its open market policies but the European Union and other trading powers called on Singapore to speed up the opening of its services sector . Supple said the struggle that Singapore had to wage in vying to host the meeting would be repeated during the talks . \" There is tension at every step of the way , \" since a battle line between the West and developing countries has been drawn over the issue of linking trade liberalisation with labour rights , he said . Supple said hosting the meeting carried prestige for Singapore , \" however , this is quite intangible as the prestige factor may not necessarily lead to any additional investment and trade flows to this region . \" From a commercial point of view , the meeting would be good for Singapore 's tourism industry , Tan said . A large part of Singapore 's workforce would be mobilised to ensure the meeting would run without a glitch but the average Singaporean \" would probably not be too concerned about some of the issues , \" Tan said . \" But the more educated public will realise that these kind of things are important for Singapore as a small economy . \" Supple said any political gains the Singapore government would get from the WTO meeting -- ahead of a general election due by April 1997 -- would depend on how successful it was in pushing its economic agenda . \" If there are any movements toward freer trade , then Singapore 's economy and the electorate would gain , \" he said . \" But I do n't think it would be wise to play up the political aspect of this . I think political issues will take secondary importance to all these economic issues that will be displayed . \"", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 3603], "labels": [[[10, 19], "Q334"], [[45, 48], "Q7825"], [[51, 66], "Unknown"], [[67, 76], "Q334"], [[88, 97], "Q334"], [[130, 154], "Q7825"], [[157, 160], "Q7825"], [[374, 383], "Q334"], [[428, 431], "Q7825"], [[441, 455], "Unknown"], [[486, 493], "Unknown"], [[498, 507], "Q334"], [[707, 711], "Q30"], [[900, 909], "Q334"], [[926, 934], "Q30"], [[960, 969], "Unknown"], [[991, 1004], "Q1850198"], [[1053, 1056], "Q7825"], [[1111, 1117], "Q71"], [[1124, 1133], "Q334"], [[1159, 1162], "Q7825"], [[1173, 1187], "Unknown"], [[1211, 1238], "Q6040758"], [[1241, 1246], "Unknown"], [[1256, 1265], "Q334"], [[1473, 1482], "Q334"], [[1623, 1635], "Unknown"], [[1669, 1701], "Q738236"], [[1777, 1780], "Q7825"], [[1811, 1818], "Q77"], [[1874, 1912], "Unknown"], [[1915, 1919], "Unknown"], [[1938, 1941], "Q7825"], [[1949, 1958], "Q334"], [[1996, 2010], "Q458"], [[2046, 2055], "Q334"], [[2105, 2111], "Unknown"], [[2135, 2144], "Q334"], [[2426, 2432], "Unknown"], [[2479, 2488], "Q334"], [[2704, 2713], "Q334"], [[2736, 2739], "Unknown"], [[2763, 2772], "Q334"], [[2870, 2881], "Unknown"], [[2949, 2952], "Unknown"], [[3048, 3057], "Q334"], [[3081, 3087], "Unknown"], [[3117, 3126], "Q334"], [[3157, 3160], "Q7825"], [[3347, 3356], "Q334"]]}

DUBLIN 1996-12-07 Jack Charlton 's relationship with the people of Ireland was cemented on Saturday when the Englishman was officially declared one of their own . Charlton , 61 , and his wife , Peggy , became citizens of Ireland when they formally received Irish passports from deputy Prime Minister Dick Spring who said the honour had been made in recognition of Charlton 's achievements as the national soccer manager . \" The years I spent as manager of the Republic of Ireland were the best years of my life . It all culminated in the fact that I now have lots of great , great friends in Ireland . That is why this is so emotional a night for me , \" Charlton said . \" It was the joy that we all had over the period , that I shared with people that I grew to love , that I treasure most , \" he added . Charlton managed Ireland for 93 matches , during which time they lost only 17 times in almost 10 years until he resigned in December 1995 . He guided Ireland to two successive World Cup finals tournaments and to the 1988 European championship finals in Germany , after the Irish beat a well-fancied England team 1-0 in their group qualifier . The lanky former Leeds United defender did not make his England debut until the age of 30 but eventually won 35 caps and was a key member of the 1966 World Cup winning team with his younger brother , Bobby .", "links": [], "evaluation_span": [0, 1415], "labels": [[[9, 19], "Q21"], [[20, 28], "Q313674"], [[49, 57], "Q27"], [[60, 66], "Q1761"], [[78, 91], "Q313674"], [[127, 134], "Q27"], [[169, 179], "Q42406"], [[223, 231], "Q313674"], [[254, 259], "Unknown"], [[281, 288], "Q27"], [[317, 322], "Q27"], [[360, 371], "Q356460"], [[424, 432], "Q313674"], [[520, 539], "Q163547"], [[652, 659], "Q27"], [[714, 722], "Q313674"], [[865, 873], "Q313674"], [[882, 889], "Q163547"], [[1015, 1022], "Q163547"], [[1041, 1050], "Q19317"], [[1086, 1094], "Q46"], [[1118, 1125], "Q183"], [[1138, 1143], "Q163547"], [[1164, 1171], "Q47762"], [[1225, 1237], "Q1128631"], [[1264, 1271], "Q47762"], [[1353, 1367], "Q134202"], [[1408, 1413], "Q171583"]]}
