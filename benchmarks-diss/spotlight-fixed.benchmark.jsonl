Prokhorov said the visit would serve as a cornerstone for future interaction between players and coaches from the Nets and young Russians, with the aim of developing basketball in Russia, where the sport is a distant third in popularity behind soccer and hockey. If the Nets pick up a strong Russian fan base in the process, that would be nice, too, he said.", "evaluation_span": [0, 1038], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [4, 8], "entity_id": "Q572134", "name": "Brooklyn Nets", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 1, "span": [22, 28], "entity_id": "Q649", "name": "Moscow", "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 2, "span": [32, 38], "entity_id": "Q132", "name": "Sunday", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 3, "span": [95, 99], "entity_id": "Q7743", "name": "home", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 4, "span": [100, 107], "entity_id": "Q6256", "name": "country", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 5, "span": [121, 126], "entity_id": "Q6498684", "name": "ownership", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 6, "span": [140, 151], "entity_id": "Q1062083", "name": "billionaire", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 7, "span": [152, 172], "entity_id": "Q233581", "name": "Mikhail Prokhorov", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 8, "span": [186, 192], "entity_id": "Q159", "name": "Russia", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 9, "span": [195, 204], "entity_id": "Q233581", "name": "Mikhail Prokhorov", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 10, "span": [216, 223], "entity_id": "Q45594", "name": "greeting", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 11, "span": [228, 235], "entity_id": "Q2066131", "name": "athlete", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871"}, {"id": 12, "span": [265, 272], "entity_id": "Q6256", "name": "country", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 13, "span": [311, 315], "entity_id": "Q7743", "name": "home", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 14, "span": [324, 328], "entity_id": "Q327245", "name": "team", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 15, "span": [354, 361], "entity_id": "Q200535", "name": "wealth", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 16, "span": [362, 370], "entity_id": "Q152478", "name": "sponsor", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871"}, {"id": 17, "span": [415, 423], "entity_id": "Q334600", "name": "practice", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 18, "span": [431, 441], "entity_id": "Q493386", "name": "friendly match", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 19, "span": [455, 459], "entity_id": "Q572134", "name": "Brooklyn Nets", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 20, "span": [485, 490], "entity_id": "Q2341939", "name": "basketball court", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 21, "span": [500, 507], "entity_id": "Q2066131", "name": "athlete", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871"}, {"id": 22, "span": [534, 540], "entity_id": "Q159", "name": "Russia", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 23, "span": [562, 567], "entity_id": "Q577", "name": "year", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 24, "span": [594, 598], "entity_id": "Q11410", "name": "game", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 25, "span": [606, 626], "entity_id": "Q136414", "name": "Alexander Gomelsky Universal Sports Hall CSKA", "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 26, "span": [653, 657], "entity_id": "Q847017", "name": "sports club", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 27, "span": [658, 667], "entity_id": "Q233581", "name": "Mikhail Prokhorov", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 28, "span": [680, 689], "entity_id": "Q233581", "name": "Mikhail Prokhorov", "type": "Q215627"}, {"id": 29, "span": [738, 744], "entity_id": "Q344", "name": "future", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 30, "span": [745, 756], "entity_id": "Q52948", "name": "interaction", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 31, "span": [765, 772], "entity_id": "Q2066131", "name": "athlete", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871"}, {"id": 32, "span": [777, 784], "entity_id": "Q41583", "name": "coach", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871"}, {"id": 33, "span": [794, 798], "entity_id": "Q572134", "name": "Brooklyn Nets", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 34, "span": [809, 817], "entity_id": "Q49542", "name": "Russians", "type": "Q33829"}, {"id": 35, "span": [846, 856], "entity_id": "Q5372", "name": "basketball", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 36, "span": [860, 866], "entity_id": "Q159", "name": "Russia", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 37, "span": [878, 883], "entity_id": "Q349", "name": "sport", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 38, "span": [906, 916], "entity_id": "Q1357284", "name": "popularity", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 39, "span": [924, 930], "entity_id": "Q2736", "name": "association football", "type": "Q17537576|Q349"}, {"id": 40, "span": [935, 941], "entity_id": "Q1622659", "name": "hockey", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 41, "span": [950, 954], "entity_id": "Q572134", "name": "Brooklyn Nets", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 42, "span": [980, 983], "entity_id": "Q193432", "name": "fan", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871"}]}
