{"id": 2000128, "title": "Online identity", "text": "Online identity\n\nInternet identity (IID), also online identity or internet persona, is a social identity that an Internet user establishes in online communities and websites. It can also be considered as an actively constructed presentation of oneself. Although some people choose to use their real names online, some Internet users prefer to be anonymous, identifying themselves by means of pseudonyms, which reveal varying amounts of personally identifiable information. An online identity may even be determined by a user's relationship to a certain social group they are a part of online. Some can even be deceptive about their identity.\n\nIn some online contexts, including Internet forums, online chats, and massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), users can represent themselves visually by choosing an avatar, an icon-sized graphic image. Avatars are one way users express their online identity. Through interaction with other users, an established online identity acquires a reputation, which enables other users to decide whether the identity is worthy of trust. Online identities are associated with users through authentication, which typically requires registration and logging in. Some websites also use the user's IP address or tracking cookies to identify users.\n\nThe concept of the self, and how this is influenced by emerging technologies, are a subject of research in fields such as education, psychology and sociology. The online disinhibition effect is a notable example, referring to a concept of unwise and uninhibited behavior on the Internet, arising as a result of anonymity and audience gratification.\n\nThe social web, i.e. the usage of the web to support the social process, represents a space in which people have the possibility to express and expose their identity in a social context.\nFor example, people define their identity explicitly by creating user profiles in social network services such as Facebook or LinkedIn and online dating services. By expressing opinions on blogs and other social media, they define more tacit identities.\n\nThe disclosure of a person's identity may present certain issues related to privacy. Many people adopt strategies that help them control the disclosure of their personal information online. Some strategies require users to invest considerable effort.\n\nThe emergence of the concept of online identity has raised many questions among academics. Social networking services and online avatars have complicated the concept of identity. Academia has responded to these emerging trends by establishing domains of scholarly research such as technoself studies, which focuses on all aspects of human identity in technological societies.\n\nOnline activities may affect our offline personal identity, as well. Avi Marciano has coined the term \"VirtuReal\" to resolve the contested relationship between online and offline environments in relation to identity formation. Studying online usage patterns of transgender people, he suggested that the internet can be used as preliminary, complementary, and/or alternative sphere. He concludes that although \"the offline world sets boundaries that potentially limit the latitude within the online world, these boundaries are wide enough to allow mediated agency that empowers transgender users. Consequently, the term VirtuReal \"reflects both the fact that it provides an empowering virtual experience that compensates for offline social inferiority, and the fact that it is nevertheless subject to offline restrictions\".\n\nDorian Wiszniewski and Richard Coyne in their contribution to the book \"Building Virtual Communities\" explore online identity, with emphasis on the concept of \"masking\" identity. They point out that whenever an individual interacts in a social sphere they portray a mask of their identity. This is no different online and in fact becomes even more pronounced due to the decisions an online contributor must make concerning his or her online profile. He or she must answer specific questions about age, gender, address, username and so forth. Furthermore, with the accrual of one's online activity, his or her mask is increasingly defined by his or her style of writing, vocabulary and topics.\n\nThe kind of mask one chooses reveals at least something of the subject behind the mask. One might call this the \"metaphor\" of the mask. The online mask does not reveal the actual identity of a person. It, however, does reveal an example of what lies behind the mask. For instance, if a person chooses to act like a rock star online, this metaphor reveals an interest in rock music. Even if a person chooses to hide behind a totally false identity, this says something about the fear and lack of self-esteem behind the false mask.\n\nBecause of many emotional and psychological dynamics, people can be reluctant to interact online. By evoking a mask of identity a person can create a safety net. One of the great fears of online identity is having one's identity stolen or abused. This fear keeps people from sharing who they are. Some are so fearful of identity theft or abuse that they will not even reveal information already known about them in public listings. By making the mask available, people can interact with some degree of confidence without fear.\n\nWiszniewski and Coyne state \"Education can be seen as the change process by which identity is realized, how one finds one's place. Education implicates the transformation of identity. Education, among other things, is a process of building up a sense of identity, generalized as a process of edification.\" Students interacting in an online community must reveal something about themselves and have others respond to this contribution. In this manner, the mask is constantly being formulated in dialogue with others and thereby students will gain a richer and deeper sense of who they are. There will be a process of edification that will help students come to understand their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThis mask perspective is likened to the concept of 'blended identity', whereby the offline-self informs the creation of a new online-self, which in turn informs the offline-self through further interaction with those the individual first met online.\n\nAs blogs allow an individual to express his or her views in individual essays or as part of a wider discussion, it creates a public forum for expressing ideas. Bloggers often choose to use pseudonyms, whether in platforms such as WordPress or in interest-centered sites like Blogster, to protect personal information and allow them more editorial freedom to express ideas that might be unpopular with their family, employers, etc. Use of a pseudonym (and a judicious approach to revealing personal information) can allow a person to protect their \"real\" identities, but still build a reputation online using the assumed name.\n\nDigital identity management is becoming something that individuals need to consider when applying for jobs of while working for a company. Social media has been a tool for human resources for years. A KPMG report on social media in human resources say that 76 percent of American companies used LinkedIn for recruiting. The ease of search means that reputation management will become more vital especially in professional services such as lawyers, doctors and accountants.\n\nOnline social networks like Facebook and MySpace allow people to maintain an online identity with some overlap between online and real world context. These identities are often created to reflect a specific aspect or ideal version of themselves. Representations include pictures, communications with other 'friends' and membership in network groups. Privacy control settings on social networks are also part of social networking identity.\n\nSome users may use their online identity as an extension of their physical selves, and center their profiles around realistic details. These users value continuity in their identity, and would prefer being honest with the portrayal of themselves. However, there is also a group of social network users that would argue against using a real identity online. These users have experimented with online identity, and ultimately what they have found is that it is possible to create an alternate identity through the usage of such social networks. For example, a popular blogger on medium.com writes under the name of Kel Campbell \u2013 a name that was chosen by her, not given to her. She states that when she was verbally attacked online by another user, she was able to protect herself from the sting of the insult by taking it as Kel, rather than her true self. Kel became a shield of sorts, and acted as a mask that freed the real user beneath it.\n\nSuch are the benefits of forming an alternate identity in online spaces. The \"I\" becomes subject to the \"Me\", and individuals are given the power to shape themselves into whoever (or whatever) they desire to become. Stories of people learning about their \"hidden extroversion\" or \"unknown creativity\" or becoming \"someone else\" are still at large. Research from scientists such as Danah Boyd and Knut Lundby has even found that in some cultures, the ability to form an identity online is considered a sacred privilege. This is because having an online identity allows the user to accomplish things that otherwise are impossible to do in real life. These cultures believe that the self has become a subjective concept on the online spaces; by logging onto their profiles, users are essentially freed from the prison of a physical body and can \"create a narrative of the self in virtual space that may be entirely new\".\n\nThe possibilities are endless \u2013 which is a feasible explanation for the explosive popularity of social networking sites in the past decade. Users are captivated by the opportunity to express themselves in an endless number of ways. Perhaps social networks will always remain popular, as long as the incentive to join is always present.\n\nIn the development of social networks, there has appeared a new economic phenomenon: doing business via social networks. For example, there are many users of WeChat called wei-businessmen (Wechat businessman, a new form of e-commerce in Wechat) who sell products on WeChat. Doing business via social networks is not that easy. The identities of users in social networks are not the same as that in the real world. For the sake of security, people do not tend to trust someone in social networks, in particular when it is related with money. So for wei-businessmen, reputations are very important for wei-business. They need to invest enormous efforts to gain reputations among the users of WeChat, which in turn increases the chance other users will purchase from them.\n\nOnline identity in classrooms forces people to reevaluate their concepts of classroom environments. With the invention of online classes, classrooms have changed and no longer have the traditional face-to-face communications. These communications have been replaced by computer screen. Students are no longer defined by visual characteristics unless they make them known. There are pros and cons to each side. In a traditional classroom, students are able to visually connect with a teacher who was standing in the same room. During the class, if questions arise, clarification can be provided immediately. Students can create face-to-face connections with other students, and these connections can easily be extended beyond the classroom. For timid or socially awkward students, this ability to form and extend relationships through personal contact may hold little appeal. For these students, the appeal may reside in online courses, where computer communications allow them a greater degree of separation and anonymity.\n\nWith the prevalence of remote Internet communications, students do not form preconceptions of their classmates based on the classmate's appearance or speech characteristics. Rather, impressions are formed based only on the information presented by the classmate. Some students are more comfortable with this paradigm as it avoids the discomfort of public speaking. Students who do not feel comfortable stating their ideas in class can take time to sit down and think through exactly what they wish to say.\n\nCommunication via written media may lead students to take more time to think through their ideas since their words are in a more permanent setting (online) than most conversations carried on during class (Smith).\n\nOnline learning situations also cause a shift in perception of the professor. Whereas anonymity may help some students achieve a greater level of comfort, professors must maintain an active identity with which students may interact. The students should feel that their professor is ready to help whenever they may need it. Although students and professors may not be able to meet in person, emails and correspondence between them should occur in a timely manner. Without this students tend to drop online classes since it seems that they are wandering through a course without anyone to guide them.\n\nIn Virtual world, the users create a personal avatar and communicate with others through the virtual identity. The virtual personal figure and voice may draw from the real figure or fantasy worlds. The virtual figure to some degree reflects the personal expectation, and users may play a totally different personality in virtual world than in reality.\n\nAn Internet forum, or message board, is an online discussion site where people can hold conversations in the form of posted messages.\nThere are many types of Internet forums based on certain themes or groups. The properties of online identities also differ from different type of forums. For example, the users in a university BBS usually know some of the others in reality since the users can only be the students or professors in this university. However the freedom of expression is limited since some university BBSs are under control of the school administration and the identities are related to student IDs. On another hand, some question-and-answer websites like \"ZhiHu\" in China are open to the public and users can create accounts only with e-mail address. But they can describe their specialties or personal experiences to show reliability in certain questions, and other users can also invite them to answer questions based on their profiles. The answers and profiles can be either real-name or anonymous.\n\nA discussed positive aspect of virtual communities is that people can now present themselves without fear of persecution, whether it is personality traits, behaviors that they are curious about, or the announcement of a real world identity component that has never before been announced.\n\nThis freedom results in new opportunities for society as a whole, especially the ability for people to explore the roles of gender and sexuality in a manner that can be harmless, yet interesting and helpful to those undertaking the change. Online identity has given people the opportunity to feel comfortable in wide-ranging roles, some of which may be underlying aspects of the user's life that the user is unable to portray in the real world.\n\nOnline identity has a beneficial effect for minority groups, including ethnic minority populations, people with disabilities, etc. Online identities may help remove prejudices created by stereotypes found in real life, and thus provide a greater sense of inclusion.\n\nA prime example of these opportunities is the establishment of many communities welcoming gay and lesbian teens who are dealing with their sexuality. These communities allow teens to share their experiences with one another and older gay and lesbian people, and may they provide a community that is both non-threatening and non-judgmental. In a review of such a community, Silberman quotes an information technology worker, Tom Reilly, as stating: \"The wonderful thing about online services is that they are an intrinsically decentralized resource. Kids can challenge what adults have to say and make the news\". If teen organizers are successful anywhere, news of it is readily available. The Internet is arguably the most powerful tool that young people with alternative sexualities have ever had.\n\nThe online world provides users with a choice to determine which sex, sexuality preference and sexual characteristics they would like to embody. In each online encounter, a user essentially has the opportunity to interchange which identity they would like to portray. As McRae argues in Surkan (2000), \"The lack of physical presence and the infinite malleability of bodies complicates sexual interaction in a singular way: because the choice of gender is an \"option\" rather than a strictly defined biological characteristic, the entire concept of gender as a primary marker of identity becomes partially subverted.\"\n\nOnline identity can offer potential social benefits to those with physical and sensory disabilities. The flexibility of online media provides control over their disclosure of impairment, an opportunity not typically available in real world social interactions. Researchers highlight its value in improving inclusion. However, it is notable that the affordance of \"normalization\" offers the possibility of experiencing non-stigmatized identities while also offering the capacity to create harmful and dangerous outcomes, which may jeopardize participants' safety.\n\nPrimarily, concerns regarding virtual identity revolve around the areas of misrepresentation and the contrasting effects of on and offline existence. Sexuality and sexual behavior online provide some of the most controversial debate with many concerned about the predatory nature of some users. This is particularly in reference to concerns about child pornography and the ability of pedophiles to obscure their identity.\n\nFinally, the concerns regarding the connection between on and offline lives are challenging the notions of what constitutes real experience. In reference to gender, sexuality and sexual behavior, the ability to play with these ideas has resulted in a questioning of how virtual experience may affect one's offline emotions. As McRae states, at its best, virtual sex not only complicates but drastically unsettles the division between mind, body, and self that has become a comfortable truism in Western metaphysics. When projected into virtuality, mind, body and self all become consciously-manufactured constructs through which individuals interact with each other.\n\nThe identities that people define in the social web are not necessarily facets of their offline self. Studies have shown that people lie in online dating services. In the case of social network services such as Facebook, companies are even proposing to sell 'friends' as a way to increase a user's visibility, calling into question even more the reliability of a person's 'social identity'.\n\nVan Gelder reported a famous incident occurring on a computer conferencing system during the early 80s where a male psychiatrist posed as Julie, a female psychologist with multiple disabilities including deafness, blindness, and serious facial disfigurement. Julie endeared herself to the computer conferencing community, finding psychological and emotional support from many members. The psychiatrist's choice to present differently was sustained by drawing upon the unbearable stigma attached to Julie's multiple disabilities as justification for not meeting face-to-face. Lack of visual cues allowed the identity transformation to continue, with the psychiatrist also assuming the identity of Julie's husband, who adamantly refused to allow anyone to visit Julie when she claimed to be seriously ill. This example highlights the ease with which identity may be constructed, transformed, and sustained by the textual nature of online interaction and the visual anonymity it affords.\n\nCatfishing is a way for a user to create a fake online profile, sometimes with fake photos and information, in order to enter into a relationship, intimate or platonic, with another user. Catfishing became popular in mainstream culture through the MTV reality show \"\".\n\nA problem facing anyone who hopes to build a positive online reputation is that reputations are site-specific; for example, one's reputation on eBay cannot be transferred to Slashdot.\n\nMultiple proposals have been made to build an identity management infrastructure into the Web protocols. All of them require an effective public key infrastructure so that the identity of two separate manifestations of an online identity (say, one on Wikipedia and another on Twitter) are probably one and the same.\n\nOpenID, an open, decentralized standard for authenticating users is used for access control, allowing users to log on to different services with the same digital identity. These services must allow and implement OpenID.\n\nGiven the malleability of online identities, some economists have expressed surprise that flourishing trading sites (such as eBay) have developed on the Internet. When two pseudonymous identities propose to enter into an online transaction, they are faced with the prisoner's dilemma: the deal can succeed only if the parties are willing to trust each other, but they have no rational basis for doing so. But successful Internet trading sites have developed reputation management systems, such as eBay's feedback system, which record transactions and provide the technical means by which users can rate each other's trustworthiness. However, users with malicious intent can still cause serious problems on such websites.\n\nAn online reputation is the perception that one generates on the Internet based on their digital footprint. Digital footprints accumulate through all of the content shared, feedback provided and information that created online. Due to the fact that if someone has a bad online reputation, he can easily change his pseudonym, new accounts on sites such as eBay or Amazon are usually distrusted. If an individual or company wants to manage their online reputation, they will face many more difficulties. This is why a merchant on the web having a brick and mortar shop is usually more trusted.\n\nUltimately, online identity cannot be completely free from the social constraints that are imposed in the real world. As Westfall (2000, p.\u00a0160) discusses, \"the idea of truly departing from social hierarchy and restriction does not occur on the Internet (as perhaps suggested by earlier research into the possibilities presented by the Internet) with identity construction still shaped by others. Westfall raises the important, yet rarely discussed, issue of the effects of literacy and communication skills of the online user.\" Indeed, these skills or the lack thereof have the capacity to shape one's online perception as they shape one's perception through a physical body in the \"real world.\"\n\nThis issue of gender and sexual reassignment raises the notion of disembodiment and its associated implications. \"Disembodiment\" is the idea that once the user is online, the need for the body is no longer required, and the user can participate separately from it. This ultimately relates to a sense of detachment from the identity defined by the physical body. In cyberspace, many aspects of sexual identity become blurred and are only defined by the user. Questions of truth will therefore be raised, particularly in reference to online dating and virtual sex. As McRae states, \"Virtual sex allows for a certain freedom of expression, of physical presentation and of experimentation beyond one's own real-life limits\". At its best, it not only complicates but drastically unsettles the division between mind, body and self in a manner only possible through the construction of an online identity.\n\nThe future of online anonymity depends on how an identity management infrastructure is developed. Law enforcement officials often express their opposition to online anonymity and pseudonymity, which they view as an open invitation to criminals who wish to disguise their identities. Therefore, they call for an identity management infrastructure that would irrevocably tie online identity to a person's legal identity]; in most such proposals, the system would be developed in tandem with a secure national identity document. Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google, has stated that the Google+ social network is intended to be exactly such an identity system. The controversy resulting from Google+'s policy of requiring users to sign in using legal names has been dubbed the \"nymwars\".\n\nOnline civil rights advocates, in contrast, argue that there is no need for a privacy-invasive system because technological solutions, such as reputation management systems, are already sufficient and are expected to grow in their sophistication and utility.\n\nAn online predator is an Internet user who exploits other users' vulnerability, often for sexual or financial purposes. It is relatively easy to create an online identity which is attractive to people that would not normally become involved with the predator, but fortunately there are a few means by which you can make sure that a person whom you haven't met is actually who they say they are. Many people will trust things such as the style in which someone writes, or the photographs someone has on their web page as a way to identify that person, but these can easily be forged. Long-term Internet relationships may sometimes be difficult to sufficiently understand knowing what someone's identity is actually like.\n\nThe most vulnerable age group to online predators is often considered to be young teenagers or older children. \"Over time - perhaps weeks or even months - the stranger, having obtained as much personal information as possible, grooms the child, gaining his or her trust through compliments, positive statements, and other forms of flattery to build an emotional bond.\" The victims often do not suspect anything until it is too late, as the other party usually misleads them to believe that they are of similar age.\n\nThe show Dateline on NBC has, overall, conducted three investigations on online predators. They had adults, posing online as teenage juveniles, engage in sexually explicit conversations with other adults (the predators) and arrange to meet them in person. But instead of meeting a teenager, the unsuspecting adult was confronted by Chris Hansen, an NBC News correspondent, arrested, and shown on nationwide television. \"Dateline\" held investigations in five different locations apprehending a total of 129 men in all.\n\nFederal laws have been passed in the U.S. to assist the government when trying to catch online predators. Some of these include wiretapping, so online offenders can be caught in advance, before a child becomes a victim. In California, where one \"Dateline\" investigation took place, it is a misdemeanor for someone to have sexually-tinged conversations with a child online. The men who came to the house were charged with a felony because their intent was obvious.\n\nAn online identity that has acquired an excellent reputation is valuable for two reasons: first, one or more persons invested a great deal of time and effort to build the identity's reputation; and second, other users look to the identity's reputation as they try to decide whether it is sufficiently trustworthy. It is therefore unsurprising that online identities have been put up for sale at online auction sites. However, conflicts arise over the ownership of online identities. Recently, a user of a massively multiplayer online game called EverQuest, which is owned by Sony Online Entertainment, Inc., attempted to sell his EverQuest identity on eBay. Sony objected, asserting that the character is Sony's intellectual property, and demanded the removal of the auction; under the terms of the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), eBay could have become a party to a copyright infringement lawsuit if it failed to comply. Left unresolved is a fundamental question: Who owns an online identity created at a commercial Web site? Does an online identity belong to the person who created it, or to the company that owns the software used to create the identity?\n\n", "hyperlinks": [[[89, 104], "social identity"], [[436, 471], "personally identifiable information"], [[678, 692], "Internet forum"], [[695, 706], "online chat"], [[713, 760], "massively multiplayer online role-playing games"], [[1001, 1011], "reputation"], [[1083, 1088], "Trust (sociology)"], [[1142, 1156], "authentication"], [[1183, 1195], "Registered user"], [[1200, 1210], "Login"], [[1246, 1256], "IP address"], [[1260, 1276], "tracking cookies"], [[1316, 1320], "self"], [[1419, 1428], "education"], [[1430, 1440], "psychology"], [[1445, 1454], "sociology"], [[1460, 1487], "online disinhibition effect"], [[1651, 1661], "social web"], [[1779, 1786], "online identity management"], [[1899, 1911], "user profile"], [[1916, 1939], "social network services"], [[1948, 1956], "Facebook"], [[1960, 1968], "LinkedIn"], [[1973, 1994], "online dating service"], [[2023, 2028], "blogs"], [[2076, 2086], "Identity (social science)"], [[2165, 2172], "privacy"], [[2432, 2457], "Social networking service"], [[2470, 2476], "Avatar (computing)"], [[2622, 2632], "technoself"], [[3565, 3578], "Richard Coyne"], [[4044, 4050], "gender"], [[4061, 4069], "username"], [[4349, 4357], "metaphor"], [[4551, 4560], "Celebrity"], [[4668, 4682], "false identity"], [[5628, 5644], "online community"], [[6253, 6258], "blogs"], [[6480, 6489], "WordPress"], [[6525, 6533], "Blogster"], [[7379, 7387], "Facebook"], [[7392, 7399], "MySpace"], [[10150, 10156], "WeChat"], [[13111, 13124], "Virtual world"], [[13464, 13478], "Internet forum"], [[14511, 14530], "virtual communities"], [[15259, 15273], "minority group"], [[15470, 15479], "Inclusion (value and practice)"], [[17810, 17827], "child pornography"], [[17847, 17857], "Pedophilia"], [[19932, 19942], "Catfishing"], [[20346, 20350], "eBay"], [[20376, 20384], "Slashdot"], [[20433, 20452], "identity management"], [[20481, 20490], "Communications protocol"], [[20525, 20550], "public key infrastructure"], [[20638, 20647], "Wikipedia"], [[20663, 20670], "Twitter"], [[20704, 20710], "OpenID"], [[21190, 21208], "prisoner's dilemma"], [[21383, 21404], "reputation management"], [[21429, 21437], "feedback"], [[21736, 21753], "digital footprint"], [[22192, 22208], "brick and mortar"], [[23488, 23499], "virtual sex"], [[23859, 23868], "anonymity"], [[24017, 24029], "pseudonymity"], [[24241, 24255], "natural person"], [[24345, 24362], "identity document"], [[24364, 24376], "Eric Schmidt"], [[24385, 24391], "Google"], [[24413, 24420], "Google+"], [[24604, 24611], "nymwars"], [[26121, 26129], "Dateline NBC"], [[26444, 26456], "Chris Hansen"], [[27642, 27651], "EverQuest"], [[27671, 27702], "Sony"], [[27808, 27829], "intellectual property"], [[27900, 27932], "Digital Millennium Copyright Act"], [[27977, 27999], "copyright infringement"]], "title_synonyms": [[17, 34], [36, 39], [47, 62], [66, 82]], "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2000128", "evaluation_span": [22938, 24873], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [23504, 23509], "entity_id": "Q113843169", "name": "Shannon McRae", "type": "Q215627", "coref": false}, {"id": 1, "span": [23936, 23961], "entity_id": "Q6503343", "name": "law enforcement officer", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871", "coref": false}, {"id": 4, "span": [24072, 24081], "entity_id": "Q2159907", "name": "criminal", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871", "coref": false}, {"id": 7, "span": [24364, 24376], "entity_id": "Q92747", "name": "Eric Schmidt", "type": "Q215627", "coref": false}, {"id": 8, "span": [24378, 24381], "entity_id": "Q484876", "name": "chief executive officer", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871", "coref": false}, {"id": 9, "span": [24385, 24391], "entity_id": "Q95", "name": "Google", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229", "coref": false}, {"id": 10, "span": [24413, 24435], "entity_id": "Q356", "name": "Google+", "type": "Q2424752", "children": [11], "coref": false}, {"id": 11, "span": [24413, 24420], "entity_id": "Q356", "name": "Google+", "type": "Q2424752", "parent": 10, "coref": false}, {"id": 12, "span": [24518, 24525], "entity_id": "Q356", "name": "Google+", "type": "Q2424752", "coref": false}, {"id": 13, "span": [24615, 24644], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER", "children": [14], "coref": false}, {"id": 14, "span": [24622, 24644], "entity_id": "Q1021386", "name": "civil rights advocate", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871", "parent": 13, "coref": false}]}

{"id": 3586255, "title": "NZR K class (1877)", "text": "NZR K class (1877)\n\nThe NZR K class of 1877 was the first example of American-built locomotives to be used on New Zealand's rail network. Their success coloured locomotive development in New Zealand until the end of steam.\n\nIn 1877, the new Chief Mechanical Engineer of the NZR, Allison D. Smith required additional motive power for the fledgling Government system. It had been intended to order more J Class locomotives which were of English design. However, Mr Smith was adamant American locomotives would be much more suitable for New Zealand's conditions. His argument won (see Vogel railways), and an order was placed with the Rogers Locomotive Works of New Jersey, for two tender locomotives with a wheel arrangement of 2-4-2. The initial two Rogers locos were ordered prior to Smith\u2019s appointment as Locomotive Engineer on 10 April 1877 (he had been manager of the Wellington section), and were ordered through New York consulting engineer Walton Evans. The locomotives were described by R.D. Grant as having the design hallmarks of Roger's Superintendent William H. Hudson, with his truck design innovations and his patented compensated springing throughout from the front bissel truck to the driving wheel springs and to the rear swinging truck.\nUpon their arrival to New Zealand, the locomotives created quite a stir with their bar frames, Gothic style wooden cabs, locomotive bell, ornate embellishments and, rakish appearances which were at odds with the traditional English locomotive appearance in New Zealand at the time and were described by journalist Charles Rous-Marten as \"a watch with all its works outside\". One Christchurch paper suggested that they needed a glass case to protect them from the weather. They looked flimsy because of the bar frames rather than the heavier plate frames of the Js. In addition, this first pair, K 87 \"Lincoln\" and K 88 \"Washington\", reputedly wore a kaleidoscope of colours \u2013 green, blue, yellow, red, purple, and gold in addition to their Russian Iron boiler jackets. The Baldwin and Rogers locomotives reflected the styling adopted in the 1870s by American builders with elements from the Renaissance Revival and Neo-Baroque architectural styles, and with Islamic Moorish (from Alhambra) influences. Bold colours and painted decorations were used.\n\nAfter arrival in the South Island at Lyttelton, the locomotives were quickly put into service. K 87 \"Lincoln\" quickly distinguished itself by hauling the first bogie-carriage passenger train, and both the locomotives soon earned a reputation as fast and free runners, with mild coal consumption. K 88 \"Washington\" hauled the first train between Christchurch and Dunedin in 1878 on the just-completed Main South Line, assisted by the Double Fairlie \"Josephine\" south of Oamaru until \"Josephine\" had to be taken off the train due to mechanical issues - caused by how K 88 was being driven by its driver. Six more of the class was ordered from the Rogers Locomotive Works, numbered from 92 through 97 before K's 87 and 88 had entered service - the former being ordered in January 1878 while the latter entered service in March 1878, such was Allison Smiths faith in the type of engine he had ordered. Allison Smiths faith was well placed with railway authorities regarding the first two K's as \"infinitely superior to the English locomotives\" in operation during the same period. The second batch of locomotives entered service in the South Island and contained almost no differences to the first two, albeit they were not given names and there is no record of them wearing the same kaleidoscope livery (it is likely K 87 and K 88 had been repainted by this time also). In 1883, due to its design characteristics, the K class was the only class of engine officially permitted to run at 35 miles per hour in ordinary service.\n\nAs more powerful locomotives arrived on the railway system, increasingly of American origin from Baldwin, the K class became relegated from the top expresses and cascaded down to express trains on secondary lines. Two of the K's, K 93 and K 96, were transferred to the North Island during this time. Beginning just after 1900 the class started receiving new NZR-built boilers to replace their Rogers-built wagon-top boiler. The South Island locomotives gained boilers of a Belpaire design, while the North Island pair received round-top boilers. All the new boilers were pressed to 160psi, an increase over the original boiler's 130psi. By this time all the locomotives had received Westinghouse brake equipment also. It was during this time that some of the K class, having been relegated to the Kingston-Gore branch, began earning a reputation for the Kingston-Invercargill express train which earned the name \"Kingston Flyer\".\n\nThe days of the K class in service were over during the 1920s. Both the North Island examples, plus K 87 \"Lincoln\" had been withdrawn as early as 1922. The others managed to linger on for a few more years yet, with the last two, K 92 and K 95, not withdrawn until 1927. As was customary at the time, the locomotives were set aside pending disposal, whatever form that may have taken. All remaining South Island class members lasted long enough to be dumped as embankment protection, something which began in 1926.\n\nThree of the Rogers K class have so far been exhumed and entered into preservation. The first and most notable of these locomotives is K 88 \"Washington\", which was exhumed from its river grave by the Southland Vintage Car Club on 19 and 20 January 1974. There were a number of loose plans regarding the locomotive's future but these came to nothing. The locomotive wreck was threatened with being pushed back into the river until The Plains Vintage Railway & Historical Museum came up with ambitious plans to restore it back to working order. Beginning in July 1974, they achieved this goal in on the 7 November 1981 proving that the restoration of exhumed locomotives was possible. It was recommissioned on the 25 November the following year. However, on 24 September 1987 the boiler of K 88 (which was the boiler that it had been recovered from the Oreti River with) was condemned, and it was not until 30 March 2002 that K 88 was once again in working order, this time with a new Belpaire-style all-welded boiler and wearing an interpretation of the kaleidoscope colours.\n\nThe other two locomotives exhumed so far are K 94, exhumed by a private owner and moved to The Plains Railway on 21 April 1986. It is in storage in an un-restored state with no active plans for restoration. And K 92, recovered in 1985 by the Fiordland Vintage Machinery Club for their Museum's railway venture on the shores of Lake Te Anau. Partially restored in Te Anau the venture fell through before the locomotive had been fully completed and subsequently the locomotive was put up for sale, with the restoration being completed in Dunedin. Purchased by Colin Smith in 1998, the locomotive's restoration was completed and it is intended to recreate the old \"Kingston Flyer\" trains of the early 1900s at the Waimea Plains Railway. While waiting for the railway to be completed, K 92 has visited a number of railways in the South Island, with some of the more notable visits being those to the Kingston Flyer, an old haunt for K 92 where it triple headed with the two A class locomotives resident there, and also a visit to the Plains, home of K 88, where both locomotives were used together extensively.\n\n\n", "hyperlinks":

He also served as an administrator at various positions within the Soviet government, including the leadership positions in Byelorussian and Kazakh SSRs.\n\nPonomarenko was born in khutor Shelkovskiy in Kuban oblast to an ethnic Ukrainian peasant family coming from Kharkov governorate. He fought in the Russian civil war and became a member of the Communist party in 1925.\n\nFrom 1938 to 1947, Ponomarenko was the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Belorussia, and from 1944 to 1948, also the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Belarus. During the Great Purge he successfully defended Belarusian-language poets Yanka Kupala and Yakub Kolas from repressions, personally travelling to Stalin to appeal for their protection. The two poets were later awarded the Order of Lenin.\n\nDuring this time he also assisted the National Jazz Orchestra in Minsk, inviting Eddie Rosner to lead it.\n\nDuring World War II, he was one of the leaders of the Communist partisan units within Nazi-occupied Belarus. He was granted the rank of Lieutenant general in March 1943.\n\nAccording to the Polish Institute of National Remembrance, during that time he also clashed with the Polish underground and gave orders for his troops to disarm them and execute their officers. In this aspect, the institute claims, the forces under Ponomarenko's command initiated a limited collaboration with the Nazi occupation forces informing on members of the Polish underground.\n\nFrom 16 October 1952 until 6 March 1953, Ponomarenko was a member of the Politburo (called Presidium at the time) of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He was made First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Kazakh SSR in 1954 before becoming the Soviet ambassador to Poland between 1955 and 1957.\n\nFrom 26 October 1957 to 22 April 1959 Ponomarenko was the Soviet ambassador to India and Nepal, and from 30 June 1959 to 21 June 1962 to the Netherlands.\n\nIn his later years, Ponomarenko was a professor at the between 1964 and 1974.\n\nIn the video game Hearts of Iron IV by Paradox Interactive, Panteleimon Ponomarenko became a meme due to his name being the generic name of a communist leader in one of the numerous mods for the game. The generic leader portrait is wrongly believed to be based on him, even though it in fact depicts John Adams, 1st Baron Adams. \n\n", "hyperlinks": [[[111, 148], "Belarusian resistance during World

{"id": 1092869, "title": "Archaeological Museum of Asturias", "text": "Archaeological Museum of Asturias\n\nThe Archaeological Museum of Asturias (Spanish: Museo Arqueol\u00f3gico de Asturias; Asturian: Mus\u00e9u Arqueol\u00f3xicu d'Asturies) is housed in the 16th century Benedictine monastery of Saint Vicente in Oviedo, Asturias, Spain. Its findings include collections of the Asturian Neolithic, Megalithic, Bronze Age, Iron Age, Astur hill fort culture, Roman period, and of the Gothic, Pre-Romanesque and Romanesque periods of the Kingdom of Asturias. The museum also includes sections of Asturian Ethnography, Heraldry, Medieval and Modern Epigraphy, Spanish Numismatics, a European Medal Section, and Armor.\n\nThe museum falls under the Spanish Ministry of Education and Culture but is managed by the Council of Culture of the Government of the Principality of Asturias.\n\nThe museum underwent a series of refurbishment works beginning in 2004, being reinaugurated and reopened to the public on March 21, 2011.\n\n\nThe permanent exhibition narrates the history of the Asturian region from prehistory to the High and Late Middle Ages, through the material culture preserved in the museum, giving us a view of the different peoples that have inhabited this territory over its many centuries of history.\n\nArchaeological investigations have revealed the subsistence strategies (hunting, fishing and foraging) and technical advances in the manufacture of tools of the prehistoric people who occupied caves and shelters near rivers. Of particular note is the presentation of the world of the Neanderthals, provided by the latest discoveries in the Asturian cave of El Sidr\u00f3n. The enigmatic universe of the different mindsets finds its most eloquent expression in Paleolithic parietal art and furniture. In Asturias, images of great beauty are to be found in nearly fifty caves, where our remotest ancestors carved or painted animals, symbols and summary representations of the human body.\n\nFrom the Neolithic up through the Bronze Age, a drastic cultural change occurred as compared to the traditional way of life of Paleolithic societies. The people that populated our region about 4,500 years ago felled forests, cleared the first fields for crops and opened up areas of pasture land for raising animals. Megaliths, with their ritualistic and territorial significance, became a part of the Asturian landscape as a reflection of the complex new agricultural society. The intensive exploitation of copper mines and the expansion of the metallurgical phenomenon led to the development of increasingly complex societies. During this period, Asturias began its long history as a mining region.\n\nThe castros (fortified settlements) nowadays constitute one of the most visible elements of the Asturian landscape, the typical habitat in Asturias between the end of the Bronze Age and Roman settlement, i.e., during the Iron Age. The castros had an autonomous nature, with the defenses being the most outstanding boundary element, emblematic of these communities that appeared to be quite dissociated and divided into clans.\n\nWith the arrival of Rome to the distant lands bordering the Bay of Biscay in the times of the emperor Augustus, Asturias became part of the Roman Empire. Under Roman rule, the territory became truly unified due to the creation of both urban and rural centers connected by an extensive network of roads. Profit from the gold mines focused Rome's attention on the western area of the region, exploiting deposits on a large scale. New economic and trade activities arose throughout the country, bringing about a change in the habits and customs of a traditionally mining and agricultural population. The presence of Rome in Asturias also marked our region's entrance into the cultural spheres of the classical world.\n\nThe Kingdom of Asturias inaugurated the Middle Ages in this region. Royal sites, churches, monasteries and castles comprised the main centers of power of the monarchy and the early medieval aristocracy. However, most of the rural population lived in modest houses with simple household furnishings in small villages. The art of the Astur monarchy is noted for its architectural and ornamental originality. From the 13th century on, new urban centers and towns (Asturian polas) concentrated the population and centralized administrative, trade and craft activities. New Romanesque and Gothic churches were built in these cities, towns and villages. Towards the end of medieval times, there emerged a new aristocracy which played a major role in the political, economic and social life of the region.\n\nCompleting the exhibition a specific section entitled \u201cFrom Collection to Museum\u201d, which looks at how the Museum came to be, its history running almost parallel to the beginnings of scientific archeology in the region.\n\nIn an annex to this thematic area is a tribute to the figure of Friar Benito Feijoo y Montenegro, extraordinary figure of the Spanish Enlightenment and abbot of the Monastery of San Vicente. A Benedictine cell has been reconstructed in the grandest part of the old cloister, just like the one found in the Museum's former exhibition. In this way, we continue to recognize the most prolific essayist of the 18th century, whose intellectual work marked a milestone in the evolution of thought and science of that time.\n\nAnother section is devoted to the dissemination and appreciation of World Heritage sites in Asturias: Paleolithic cave art and monuments of the Asturian monarchy. Through a series of interactive screens and audiovisuals, visitors are given relevant information on these heritage sites as well as the various archaeological routes that can be taken to enjoy this cultural legacy.\n\nThe confiscation of church property in 1837 put a great number of religious works of art into circulation and throughout the 19th century the Asturian Commission on Monuments took on the task of collecting the remains of those abandoned and sold-off monasteries and churches. These pieces constituted the source of the Museum of Antiquities\u2019 collection, which gradually grew through the donations made by several of its members, as well as by collectors and scholars concerned with the past.\n\nIn its active work, the museum was mainly involved in the restoration of pre-Romanesque churches, collecting pieces from the ruins of some of these buildings. Once in the 20th century, the development of scientific archeology meant expanding the horizon towards prehistoric times, after Palaeolithic cave art was discovered in Asturias.\n\nThroughout the 20th century, the museum's collection grew significantly as the result of archaeological excavations in Asturias. Private collections were also donated, adding to the holdings of the former Commission on Monuments. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the Provincial Government of Oviedo purchased a variety of wooden statues, furniture and other objects. Major purchases included three collections: that of the heirs of Soto Cort\u00e9s, comprising all kinds of archaeological artifacts; the numismatic collection belonging to Pedro Hurl\u00e9 Mans\u00f3; and the collection of arms and coins from the heirs of Tom\u00e1s Fern\u00e1ndez Bataller.\n\nResearch carried out since the 1970s has steadily expanded the museum's collection from the Paleolithic Age, the Metal Ages and the Roman period. The birth of archeology management, which has developed significantly since the 1990s, has led to a great deal of material from all ages being incorporated. This especially includes objects from the Middle Ages, collected from the historic centers of Asturian cities and towns, as well as from the numerous churches and monasteries which have been examined prior to their restoration.\n\nThe precedent for the current museum lies in the Provincial Commission on Monuments, created in 1845, which carried out the first actions to protect the monuments and cultural heritage of Asturias, opening the first museum in 1870 in the Convent of San Francisco, which has since ceased to exist, with pieces collected throughout the Asturian region as well as from private donations.\n\nThe current museum dates from 1944, although it was not opened to the public until 1952 in the cloister of the former Monastery of San Vicente. The collection has since grown due to excavations, donations and purchases of pieces. Given the condition of the building, in 1998 the Ministry of Culture started the process of refurbishing and expanding the museum. Works to carry out the project designed by architects Fernando Pardo Calvo and Bernardo Garc\u00eda Tapia were begun in 2004. After an investment of 16 million euros, the remodeling has increased the museum's gross floor area to 5,810 m\u00b2, of which 2,013 m\u00b2 are dedicated to its permanent exhibition.\n\nAt the same time, these works led to the discovery of a 1.6 m-high bastion from the original 8th-century wall that surrounded Oviedo. The arcades of the cloister rest on the remains of this city wall. The initial project for the works had to be modified to leave these parts of the wall exposed as yet another of the museum's treasures. The find supports historian Juan Ur\u00eda R\u00edu's hypothesis regarding the course of this wall, erected in the times of Alfonso II.\n\nSince 1952, the museum has occupied the cloister of the former Monastery of San Vicente, a building with a complex history related to the origin of the city. The cloister was declared a national monument in 1934\n\nThe Monastery of San Vicente is believed to have been founded in 761, during the reign of Fruela I. Only remnants of that first building have survived. However, the cloister, begun in the 1530s under the direction of master builder Juan de Badajoz, the Younger and completed by Juan de Cerecedo, the Elder and Juan de Cerecedo, the Younger in the 1570s, remains standing.\n\n", "hyperlinks": [[[74, 81], "Spanish language"], [[115, 123], "Asturian language"], [[211, 224], "San Vicente de Oviedo"], [[228, 234], "Oviedo"], [[236, 244], "Asturias"], [[246, 251], "Spain"], [[293, 301], "Asturias"], [[302, 311], "Neolithic"], [[313, 323], "Megalithic"], [[325, 335], "Bronze Age"], [[337, 345], "Iron Age"], [[347, 352], "Astures"], [[353, 362], "hill fort"], [[372, 377], "Ancient Rome"], [[397, 403], "Goths"], [[405, 419], "Asturian art"], [[424, 434], "Romanesque art"], [[450, 469], "Kingdom of Asturias"], [[517, 528], "Ethnography"], [[530, 538], "Heraldry"], [[560, 569], "Epigraphy"], [[579, 590], "Numismatics"], [[622, 627], "Armor"], [[665, 698], "Ministry of Education and Culture (Spain)"]], "title_synonyms": [[39, 72], [83, 113], [125, 154]], "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1092869", "evaluation_span": [1901, 3743], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [1910, 1919], "entity_id": "Q36422", "name": "Neolithic", "type": "Q1656682", "coref": false}, {"id": 1, "span": [1935, 1945], "entity_id": "Q11761", "name": "Bronze Age", "type": "OTHER", "coref": false}, {"id": 2, "span": [2028, 2039], "entity_id": "Q40203", "name": "Paleolithic", "type": "Q1656682", "coref": false}, {"id": 3, "span": [2094, 2099], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY", "coref": false}, {"id": 4, "span": [2303, 2311], "entity_id": "Q3934", "name": "Asturias", "type": "Q27096213", "coref": false}, {"id": 5, "span": [2409, 2415], "entity_id": "Q753", "name": "copper", "type": "Q43460564", "coref": false}, {"id": 6, "span": [2550, 2558], "entity_id": "Q3934", "name": "Asturias", "type": "Q27096213", "coref": false}, {"id": 8, "span": [2699, 2707], "entity_id": "Q3934", "name": "Asturias", "type": "Q27096213", "coref": false}, {"id": 9, "span": [2742, 2750], "entity_id": "Q3934", "name": "Asturias", "type": "Q27096213", "coref": false}, {"id": 10, "span": [2774, 2784], "entity_id": "Q11761", "name": "Bronze Age", "type": "OTHER", "coref": false}, {"id": 11, "span": [2789, 2794], "entity_id": "Q1747689", "name": "Ancient Rome", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229", "coref": false}, {"id": 12, "span": [2824, 2832], "entity_id": "Q11764", "name": "Iron Age", "type": "Q1656682", "coref": false}, {"id": 13, "span": [3050, 3054], "entity_id": "Q1747689", "name": "Ancient Rome", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229", "coref": false}, {"id": 14, "span": [3090, 3103], "entity_id": "Q41573", "name": "Bay of Biscay", "type": "Q27096213", "coref": false}, {"id": 15, "span": [3124, 3131], "entity_id": "Q842606", "name": "Roman emperor", "type": "Q4164871", "children": [16], "coref": false}, {"id": 16, "span": [3124, 3131], "entity_id": "Q39018", "name": "emperor", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871", "parent": 15, "coref": false}, {"id": 17, "span": [3132, 3140], "entity_id": "Q1405", "name": "Augustus", "type": "Q215627", "coref": false}, {"id": 18, "span": [3142, 3150], "entity_id": "Q3934", "name": "Asturias", "type": "Q27096213", "coref": false}, {"id": 19, "span": [3170, 3182], "entity_id": "Q2277", "name": "Roman Empire", "type": "Q1656682|Q27096213|Q43229", "coref": false}, {"id": 20, "span": [3190, 3195], "entity_id": "Q2277", "name": "Roman Empire", "type": "Q1656682|Q27096213|Q43229", "coref": false}, {"id": 22, "span": [3349, 3353], "entity_id": "Q897", "name": "gold", "type": "Q2424752|Q43460564", "coref": false}, {"id": 23, "span": [3368, 3372], "entity_id": "Q2277", "name": "Roman Empire", "type": "Q1656682|Q27096213|Q43229", "coref": false}, {"id": 26, "span": [3643, 3647], "entity_id": "Q2277", "name": "Roman Empire", "type": "Q1656682|Q27096213|Q43229", "coref": false}, {"id": 27, "span": [3651, 3659], "entity_id": "Q3934", "name": "Asturias", "type": "Q27096213", "coref": false}]}

{"id": 20490257, "title": "Eusebius (praepositus sacri cubiculi)", "text": "Eusebius (praepositus sacri cubiculi)\n\nEusebius (died 361 AD) was a high-ranking officer of the Roman Empire, holding the position of \"praepositus sacri cubiculi\" during the rule of Emperor Constantius II (337-361).\n\nEusebius held the position of \"praepositus sacri cubiculi\" in 337, when Constantine I died; he concealed the will of the Emperor. Eusebius became a supporter of Arianism, influencing the empress and many other eunuchs. He entered then at the service of one of Constantine's sons and successors, Constantius II, with whom he shared the support for Arianism and on whom he exerted a great influence.\n\nIn 354 Eusebius was sent by Constantius II to talk to Pope Liberius and then attended at the meeting between the Emperor and the Pope. He sent money to the orator Libanius in exile and, in 355, helped those Arian bishops who plotted against Athanasius of Alexandria.\n\nEusebius followed Constantius into Gaul (353-354) and then to Milan (354). Here he plotted against Constantius' cousin, brother-in-law and Caesar, Constantius Gallus; Constantius ordered him to go to Pula, where Gallus was imprisoned, to question him about his rule in the East.\n\nEusebius enriched himself taking the properties of those who were put to death on accusations of treason; when general Ursicinus refused to give him as a present his house in Antioch, in 359, Eusebius had him recalled from his office as \"magister equitum\", having Sabinianus as a substitute.\n\nEusebius was together with Constantius until the Emperor died, in 361. The new Emperor, Julian, set up the Chalcedon tribunal to judge all those officers of Constantius' who had been suspected of corrupt conduct, in particular in the case of the trial and execution of Gallus (Julian's half-brother); Eusebius was accused of plotting against Gallus, was found guilty, and was put to death.\n\n", "hyperlinks": [[[96, 108], "Roman Empire"], [[135, 161], "praepositus sacri cubiculi"], [[190, 204], "Constantius II"], [[248, 274], "praepositus sacri cubiculi"], [[289, 302], "Constantine I"], [[378, 386], "Arianism"], [[512, 526], "Constantius II"], [[644, 658], "Constantius II"], [[670, 683], "Pope Liberius"], [[779, 787], "Libanius"], [[857, 881], "Athanasius of Alexandria"], [[919, 923], "Gaul"], [[946, 951], "Milan"], [[1023, 1029], "Caesar (title)"], [[1031, 1049], "Constantius Gallus"], [[1084, 1088], "Pula"], [[1283, 1292], "Ursicinus (Roman general)"], [[1339, 1346], "Antioch"], [[1428, 1438], "Sabinianus (magister equitum)"], [[1545, 1551], "Julian (Roman emperor)"], [[1564, 1582], "Chalcedon tribunal"]], "title_synonyms": [[39, 47]], "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20490257", "evaluation_span": [616, 1455], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [619, 622], "entity_id": "DATETIME", "name": "Unknown", "type": "DATETIME", "coref": false}, {"id": 1, "span": [623, 631], "entity_id": "Q339512", "name": "Eusebius", "type": "Q215627", "coref": false}, {"id": 2, "span": [644, 658], "entity_id": "Q46418", "name": "Constantius II", "type": "Q215627", "coref": false}, {"id": 3, "span": [670, 683], "entity_id": "Q102105", "name": "Liberius", "type": "Q215627", "coref": false}, {"id": 5, "span": [729, 736], "entity_id": "Q39018", "name": "emperor", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871", "coref": false}, {"id": 7, "span": [745, 749], "entity_id": "Q19546", "name": "pope", "type": "Q12737077|Q215627|Q4164871", "coref": false}, {"id": 9, "span": [772, 778], "entity_id": "Q12859263", "name": "orator", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871", "coref": false}, {"id": 10, "span": [779, 787], "entity_id": "Q263892", "name": "Libanius", "type": "Q215627", "coref": false}, {"id": 11, "span": [805, 808], "entity_id": "DATETIME", "name": "Unknown", "type": "DATETIME", "coref": false}, {"id": 12, "span": [823, 828], "entity_id": "Q83922", "name": "Arianism", "type": "OTHER", "coref": false}, {"id": 13, "span": [829, 836], "entity_id": "Q29182", "name": "bishop", "type": "Q12737077|Q215627|Q4164871", "coref": false}, {"id": 14, "span": [857, 881], "entity_id": "Q44024", "name": "Athanasius of Alexandria", "type": "Q215627", "coref": false}, {"id": 15, "span": [884, 892], "entity_id": "Q339512", "name": "Eusebius", "type": "Q215627", "coref": false}, {"id": 16, "span": [902, 913], "entity_id": "Q46418", "name": "Constantius II", "type": "Q215627", "coref": false}, {"id": 17, "span": [919, 923], "entity_id": "Q38060", "name": "Gaul", "type": "Q27096213", "coref": false}, {"id": 18, "span": [925, 928], "entity_id": "DATETIME", "name": "Unknown", "type": "DATETIME", "coref": false}, {"id": 19, "span": [929, 932], "entity_id": "DATETIME", "name": "Unknown", "type": "DATETIME", "coref": false}, {"id": 20, "span": [946, 951], "entity_id": "Q490", "name": "Milan", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229", "coref": false}, {"id": 21, "span": [953, 956], "entity_id": "DATETIME", "name": "Unknown", "type": "DATETIME", "coref": false}, {"id": 23, "span": [983, 994], "entity_id": "Q46418", "name": "Constantius II", "type": "Q215627", "coref": false}, {"id": 24, "span": [1023, 1029], "entity_id": "Q188751", "name": "Caesar", "type": "Q4164871", "coref": false}, {"id": 25, "span": [1031, 1049], "entity_id": "Q352506", "name": "Constantius Gallus", "type": "Q215627", "coref": false}, {"id": 26, "span": [1051, 1062], "entity_id": "Q46418", "name": "Constantius II", "type": "Q215627", "coref": false}, {"id": 28, "span": [1084, 1088], "entity_id": "Q4656", "name": "Pula", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229", "coref": false}, {"id": 29, "span": [1096, 1102], "entity_id": "Q352506", "name": "Constantius Gallus", "type": "Q215627", "coref": false}, {"id": 32, "span": [1164, 1172], "entity_id": "Q339512", "name": "Eusebius", "type": "Q215627", "coref": false}, {"id": 34, "span": [1275, 1282], "entity_id": "Q83460", "name": "general", "type": "Q12737077|Q215627|Q4164871", "coref": false}, {"id": 35, "span": [1283, 1292], "entity_id": "Q731413", "name": "Ursicinus", "type": "Q215627", "coref": false}, {"id": 38, "span": [1339, 1346], "entity_id": "Q200441", "name": "Antioch", "type": "Q27096213", "coref": false}, {"id": 39, "span": [1351, 1354], "entity_id": "DATETIME", "name": "Unknown", "type": "DATETIME", "coref": false}, {"id": 40, "span": [1356, 1364], "entity_id": "Q339512", "name": "Eusebius", "type": "Q215627", "coref": false}, {"id": 43, "span": [1402, 1418], "entity_id": "Q109960", "name": "Magister equitum", "type": "Q4164871", "coref": false}, {"id": 44, "span": [1428, 1438], "entity_id": "Q2210015", "name": "Sabinianus", "type": "Q215627", "coref": false}]}

{"id": 19360289, "title": "Alp Ikizler", "text": "Alp Ikizler\n\nT. Alp Ikizler is a nephrologist, currently holding the Catherine McLaughlin Hakim chair in Medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, where he does clinical work and heads a research lab. Born in Istanbul, Turkey, he received his M.D. from the Istanbul University Faculty of Medicine.\n\nDr. Ikizler's research focuses on the nutritional and metabolic aspects of kidney disease. Specifically, his work involves identifying reliable and practical tests for protein-caloric malnutrition, which is associated with heightened risks of mortality in kidney failure patients, and using these tests to assess different treatment strategies. One study established that dialysis changes protein metabolism in such a way as to stimulate protein degradation in muscle and other tissues. Work by Ikizler's team showed that dialysis-stimulated proteolysis is partly induced by inflammation; and that parenteral nutrition during dialysis, as well as exercise during dialysis, can mitigate the defects in protein metabolism. Later papers assessed the effectiveness of oral nutritional supplementation, alone or with resistance exercise.\n\n\n", "hyperlinks": [[[33, 45], "nephrologist"], [[117, 157], "Vanderbilt University School of Medicine"], [[221, 229], "Istanbul"], [[231, 237], "Turkey"], [[255, 259], "Doctor of Medicine"], [[269, 288], "Istanbul University"], [[495, 507], "malnutrition"], [[567, 581], "kidney failure"], [[683, 691], "dialysis"], [[853, 864], "proteolysis"], [[909, 919], "parenteral"]], "title_synonyms": [[13, 27]], "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19360289", "evaluation_span": [13, 1146], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [13, 27], "entity_id": "Q4734737", "name": "Alp Ikizler", "type": "Q215627", "coref": false}, {"id": 1, "span": [33, 45], "entity_id": "Q20739489", "name": "nephrologist", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871", "coref": false}, {"id": 2, "span": [69, 101], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER", "coref": false}, {"id": 3, "span": [105, 113], "entity_id": "Q11190", "name": "medicine", "type": "Q11862829", "coref": false}, {"id": 4, "span": [117, 157], "entity_id": "Q7914466", "name": "Vanderbilt University School of Medicine", "type": "Q43229", "coref": false}, {"id": 6, "span": [221, 237], "entity_id": "Q406", "name": "Istanbul", "type": "Q27096213", "children": [7, 8], "coref": false}, {"id": 7, "span": [221, 229], "entity_id": "Q406", "name": "Istanbul", "type": "Q27096213", "parent": 6, "coref": false}, {"id": 8, "span": [231, 237], "entity_id": "Q43", "name": "Turkey", "type": "Q27096213|Q4164871|Q43229", "parent": 6, "coref": false}, {"id": 11, "span": [255, 259], "entity_id": "Q913404", "name": "Doctor of Medicine", "type": "Q2424752|Q4164871|Q618779", "coref": false}, {"id": 12, "span": [269, 308], "entity_id": "Q6065437", "name": "Istanbul Faculty of Medicine", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229", "children": [13, 14], "coref": false}, {"id": 13, "span": [269, 288], "entity_id": "Q192964", "name": "Istanbul University", "type": "Q43229", "parent": 12, "coref": false}, {"id": 14, "span": [289, 308], "entity_id": "Q6065437", "name": "Istanbul Faculty of Medicine", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229", "parent": 12, "coref": false}, {"id": 15, "span": [311, 324], "entity_id": "Q4734737", "name": "Alp Ikizler", "type": "Q215627", "children": [16, 17], "coref": false}, {"id": 16, "span": [311, 314], "entity_id": "Q4618975", "name": "Doctor", "type": "Q11862829|Q2424752|Q4164871|Q618779", "parent": 15, "coref": false}, {"id": 17, "span": [315, 322], "entity_id": "Q4734737", "name": "Alp Ikizler", "type": "Q215627", "parent": 15, "coref": false}, {"id": 19, "span": [495, 507], "entity_id": "Q12167", "name": "malnutrition", "type": "Q11862829", "coref": false}, {"id": 20, "span": [656, 659], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY", "coref": false}, {"id": 21, "span": [683, 691], "entity_id": "Q202301", "name": "renal dialysis", "type": "OTHER", "coref": false}, {"id": 22, "span": [806, 813], "entity_id": "Q4734737", "name": "Alp Ikizler", "type": "Q215627", "coref": false}, {"id": 23, "span": [833, 841], "entity_id": "Q202301", "name": "renal dialysis", "type": "OTHER", "coref": false}, {"id": 24, "span": [886, 898], "entity_id": "Q101991", "name": "inflammation", "type": "OTHER", "coref": false}, {"id": 25, "span": [937, 945], "entity_id": "Q202301", "name": "renal dialysis", "type": "OTHER", "coref": false}, {"id": 26, "span": [974, 982], "entity_id": "Q202301", "name": "renal dialysis", "type": "OTHER", "coref": false}]}

{"id": 15315355, "title": "HelioVolt", "text": "HelioVolt\n\nHelioVolt Corporation was a privately held U.S. solar energy company based in Austin, Texas, that suspended operations in 2014. The company manufactured photovoltaic (PV) solar modules using a thin film semiconductor process based on copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) to produce CIGS solar cells. HelioVolt manufactured these thin film modules for commercial rooftop, utility-scale ground mount, residential, building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) and custom installations. The company raised over $230 million in investment, including over $80 million by SK Group.\n\nHelioVolt Corporation was founded in 2001 to develop and commercialize its FASST\u00ae process for applying CIGS thin-film photovoltaics directly onto conventional construction materials. The company\u2019s FASST\u00ae process,\n\nbased on semiconductor printing, was invented by HelioVolt founder Dr. Billy J. Stanbery, an expert in the materials science of CIGS and related compound semiconductors. FASST\u00ae is a patented manufacturing process for CIGS synthesis.\n\nHelioVolt was producing thin film solar PV modules for commercial rooftop, utility-scale ground mount, residential, BIPV and custom installations. HelioVolt suspended operations in 2014 and the contents of the Austin facility were auctioned in January 2015\n\nLarge-scale investment in HelioVolt began with $8 million in Series A funding from New Enterprise Associates in 2005.\n\nA further $77 million was added in a Series B funding round co-led by Paladin Capital Group and the Masdar Clean Tech Fund in August 2007.\nThe Series B funding round was closed for a total of $101 million in October 2007\nwith investments from Sequel Venture Partners, Noventi, and Passport Capital.\n\nHelioVolt developed a new way to manufacture thin-film CIGS semiconductor coatings for solar panels, based on research into the fundamental device physics of the CIGS semiconductor material.\n\nConventional semiconductor processing requires a vacuum process to deposit the semiconductor film on the substrate. The need for vacuum chambers makes this a lengthy batch-oriented production process. HelioVolt developed a nanomaterial-based coating that could be sprayed onto a wide variety of substrates without requiring a vacuum. Non-vacuum or atmospheric deposition processes offer a combination of lower costs, process simplicity and reduced manufacturing times. The company's\nFASST manufacturing process won a Nanotech Briefs \"Nano 50\"\nnanotechnology award in 2006. In 2008, HelioVolt and NREL won an R&D 100 Award for their innovative Thin Film Solar Printing Process, as well as the year's coveted \"R&D Magazine\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Editor\u2019s Choice for Most Revolutionary Technology.\n\nHelioVolt produced thin film solar cells that could convert 14 percent of the sunlight that hit them into electricity, and solar modules with conversion efficiencies of above 12 percent, as certified by NREL.\n\nSee also list of CIGS companies for a more complete listing.\n\nFirst Solar is by far the world\u2019s largest, vertically integrated thin film solar company.

{"id": 2091831, "title": "Guilden Morden", "text": "Guilden Morden\n\nGuilden Morden, England, is a village and parish located in Cambridgeshire about 16 mi south west of Cambridge and 5 mi west of Royston in Hertfordshire. It is served by the main line Ashwell and Morden railway station 3 mi to the south in the neighbouring parish of Steeple Morden.\n\nThe parish is combined with the parishes of Abington Pigotts, Guilden Morden and Tadlow to form \"The Mordens\" ward, which is represented on South Cambridgeshire District Council by one councillor.\n\nThe parish of Guilden Morden is long and thin in shape covering an area of 1052 ha in the very south-western corner of Cambridgeshire. The parish's long western border largely follows the course of the River Cam from the point where it rises at Ruddery Spring, and which separates it from Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire. At its southern tip the parish meets the ancient Icknield Way (now the A505). Most of its long eastern border follows a stream that divides it from neighbouring Steeple Morden, and reaches its short northern border with Tadlow at Tadlow Bridge.\n\nThe area has been occupied for at least 2000 years and probably much longer; an axehead dating from 6000 BC has been found in the parish. A significant cemetery dating from Roman times has also been found in the south of the parish, containing at least 180 burials and indicating an important nearby settlement. The Guilden Morden boar, an Anglo-Saxon copper alloy figure of a boar that may have once served as the crest of a helmet, was found around 1864 or 1865 in a grave. The Saxon village was probably built after that of its neighbour Steeple Morden from which it has been separate since at least the Norman Conquest.\n\nThe hamlet of Odsey on the Baldock to Royston road was formerly home to a Cistercian grange. A hamlet named Redreth was listed until the 14th century, probably south of the village and perhaps deserted as a result of the Black Death.\n\nThe name is derived from the Old English \"Gylden More Dun\", meaning \"Golden\" (rich or productive) \"Moor Hill\".\n\nThe manor here belonged for several centuries to the Hasilden family. Thomas Hasilden (c.1322-1401) had a Royal grant of free warren in his manors of Steeple and Guilden Morden in 1374. He was then resident at Morden Hall, an ancient mansion. He was Comptroller of the household of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, and was retained for life to served him in peace or in war. He also held the manor of Soham in Cambridgeshire from the Duke as superior. In July 1381 he was commanded to meet the Duke at Berwick-upon-Tweed with seventy men-at-arms and sixty lances from his estates. He was a Knight of the Shire for Cambridgeshire in 1384 and also served in four other Parliaments. The manor continued in this family until Francis Hasilden, High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire in 1509 (died early in 1522) settled his estates on his only child Frances who conveyed them by her marriage to Sir Robert Peyton, knt., of Iselham.\n\nThe parish church of Guilden Morden has been dedicated to St Mary since at least the 15th century. The oldest parts of the nave date back to the 13th century, with the majority of the building added in the 14th century. The present building consists of a chancel, aisled and clerestoried nave with south porch, and a west tower with a short spire. The tower dates from the 15th century, and the present spire replaced an older one in 1972. The basin of the font is 12th century.\nIn 1522 Francis Hasilden, Lord of the Manor of Guilden Morden, was buried in the north aisle \"before Jesus's Altar\" in a tomb which cost his estate \u00a320 sterling.\n\nIn the village there is one open pub the King Edward VII. There is a second pub, named the Three Tuns, which was open by 1851 and closed in 2013; it is currently (2018) the subject of a campaign in the village seeking to purchase and reopen it. Next to the King Edward there is a small village shop, which is now closed. The Six Bells pub, which opened next to the church before 1801, closed some time in the 1960s or 70s, and The Black Swan opened on Swan Lane in the late 19th century and closed in the 20th century. The village's other former pubs are The Pear Tree (47 New Road), The Chestnuts, The Pig and Whistle (63 High Street), The Fox, and The Black Horse (Potton Road).\n\nGuilden Morden Primary School, founded in 1847, opened on its current site in 1974. The school has around 120 children from reception to year 6. The children then go on to Bassingbourn Village College in most cases. In addition the village has a pre-school.\n\nA fete is held each September on the recreation ground in aid of the village hall.\n\n", "hyperlinks": [[[32, 39], "England"], [[76, 90],

{"id": 11087023, "title": "Rosaline", "text": "Rosaline\n\nRosaline () is a fictional character mentioned in William Shakespeare's tragedy \"Romeo and Juliet\" (1597). She is the niece of Lord Capulet. Although an unseen character, her role is important: Romeo's unrequited love for Rosaline leads him to try to catch a glimpse of her at a gathering hosted by the Capulet family, during which he first spots Juliet.\n\nScholars generally compare Romeo's short-lived love of Rosaline with his later love of Juliet. The poetry Shakespeare writes for Rosaline is much weaker than that for Juliet. Scholars believe Romeo's early experience with Rosaline prepares him for his relationship with Juliet. Later performances of \"Romeo and Juliet\" have painted different pictures of Romeo and Rosaline's relationship, as filmmakers have experimented with making Rosaline a more visible character.\n\nBefore Romeo meets Juliet, he loves Rosaline, Capulet's niece and Juliet's cousin. He describes her as wonderfully beautiful: \"The all-seeing sun / ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.\" Rosaline, however, chooses to remain chaste; Romeo says: \"She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow / Do I live dead that live to tell it now.\" This is the source of his depression, and he makes his friends unhappy; Mercutio comments: \"That same pale, hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, torments him so that he will sure run mad.\" Benvolio urges Romeo to sneak into a Capulet gathering where, he claims, Rosaline will look like \"a crow\" alongside the other beautiful women. Romeo agrees, but doubts Benvolio's assessment. After Romeo sees Juliet his feelings suddenly change: \"Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight / For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.\" Because their relationship is sudden and secret, Romeo's friends and Friar Laurence continue to speak of his affection for Rosaline throughout much of the play.\n\nRosaline is a variant of Rosalind, a name of Old French origin: (\"hros\" = \"horse\", \"lind\" = \"soft, tender\"). When it was imported into English it was thought to be from the Latin \"rosa linda\" (\"lovely rose\"). Romeo sees Rosaline as the embodiment of the rose because of her name and her apparent perfections. The name Rosaline commonly appears in Petrarchan sonnets, a form of poetry Romeo uses to woo Juliet and to describe both Rosaline and Juliet. Since Rosaline is unattainable, she is a perfect subject for this style; but Romeo's attempt at it is forced and weak. By the time he meets Juliet his poetic ability has improved considerably.\n\nRosaline is used as a name for only one other Shakespearean character\u2014one of the main female figures in \"Love's Labours Lost\" (1598), although Rosalin\"d\" is the name of the main female character in \"As You Like It\". Scholars have found similarities between them: both are described as beautiful, and both have a way of avoiding men's romantic advances. Rosaline in \"Love's Labours Lost\" constantly rebuffs her suitor's advances and Romeo's Rosaline remains distant and chaste in his brief descriptions of her. These similarities have led some to wonder whether they are based on a woman Shakespeare actually knew, possibly the Dark Lady described in his sonnets, but there is no strong evidence of this connection.\n\nAnalysts note that Rosaline acts as a plot device, by motivating Romeo to sneak into the Capulet party where he will meet Juliet. Without her, their meeting would be unlikely. Rosaline thus acts as the impetus to bring the \"star-cross'd lovers\" to their deaths\u2014she is crucial in shaping their fate (a common theme of the play). Ironically, she remains oblivious of her role.\n\nLiterary critics often compare Romeo's love for Rosaline with his feelings for Juliet. Some see Romeo's supposed love for Rosaline as childish as compared with his true love for Juliet. Others argue that the apparent difference in Romeo's feelings shows Shakespeare's improving skill. Since Shakespeare is thought to have written early drafts of the play in 1591, and then picked them up again in 1597 to create the final copy, the change in Romeo's language for Rosaline and Juliet may mirror Shakespeare's increased skill as a playwright: the younger Shakespeare describing Rosaline, and the more experienced describing Juliet. In this view, a careful look at the play reveals that Romeo's love for Rosaline is not as petty as usually imagined.\n\nCritics also note the ways in which Romeo's relationship with Rosaline prepares him for meeting Juliet. Before meeting Rosaline, Romeo despises all Capulets, but afterwards looks upon them more favourably. He experiences the dual feelings of hate and love in the one relationship. This prepares him for the more mature relationship with Juliet\u2014one fraught by the feud between Montagues and Capulets. Romeo expresses the conflict of love and hate in Act 1, Scene 1, comparing his love for Rosaline with the feud between the two houses:\n\nPsychoanalytic critics see signs of repressed childhood trauma in Romeo's love for Rosaline. She is of a rival house and is sworn to chastity. Thus he is in an impossible situation, one which will continue his trauma if he remains in it. \nAlthough he acknowledges its ridiculous nature, he refuses to stop loving her. Psychoanalysts view this as a re-enactment of his failed relationship with his mother. Rosaline's absence is symbolic of his mother's absence and lack of affection for him. Romeo's love for Juliet is similarly hopeless, for she is a Capulet and Romeo pursues his relationship with her; the difference being that Juliet reciprocates. This does not seem likely seeing as his mother died of grief after his banishment, indicating that she probably loved him deeply.\n\nRosaline has been portrayed in various ways over the centuries. Theophilus Cibber's 1748 version of \"Romeo and Juliet\" replaced references to Rosaline with references to Juliet. This, according to critics, took out the \"love at first sight\" moment at the Capulet feast. In the 1750s, actor and theatre director David Garrick also eliminated references to Rosaline from his performances, as many saw Romeo's quick replacement of her as immoral. However, in Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 film version of \"Romeo and Juliet\", Romeo sees Rosaline (played by Paola Tedesco) first at the Capulet feast and then Juliet, of whom he becomes immediately enamoured. This scene suggests that love is short and superficial. Rosaline also appears in Renato Castellani's 1954 film version. In a brief non-Shakespearean scene, Rosaline (Dagmar Josipovitch) gives Romeo a mask at Capulet's celebration, and urges him to leave disguised before harm comes to him. Other filmmakers keep Rosaline off-camera in stricter accordance with Shakespeare's script. Rosaline also appears in the 2013 film adaptation of \"Romeo and Juliet\".\n\nRobert Nathan's 1966 romantic comedy, \"Juliet in Mantua\", presents Rosaline as a fully developed character. In this sequel, in which Romeo and Juliet did \"not\" die, the pair live ten years later in exile in Mantua. After they are forgiven and return to Verona, they learn that Rosaline is now married to Count Paris, and both couples must confront their disillusionment with their marriages. Another play, \"After Juliet\", written by Scottish playwright Sharman Macdonald, tells the story of Rosaline after Romeo dies. A main character in this play, she struggles with her loss and turns away the advances of Benvolio, who has fallen in love with her. Macdonald's daughter, Keira Knightley, played Rosaline in the play's 1999 premiere.\n\nRosaline is the main protagonist of the 2017 American drama series \"Still Star-Crossed\" she is portrayed by actress Lashana Lynch.\n", "hyperlinks": [[[60, 79], "William Shakespeare"], [[91, 107], "Romeo and Juliet"], [[163, 179], "unseen character"], [[204, 209], "Romeo Montague"], [[212, 227], "unrequited

He was unknown to the public, and it was not until 1990s when the ISPR highlighted his role as a war hero when releasing the telefilm bearing the same name of operation that was aired on the STN; his role was played by Talat Hussain in the 1990s.\n\nHis death also went unnoticed in 1977, and it was only in 2016, when the Pakistan Navy officially recognised his services on their official page on Facebook.\n", "hyperlinks": [[[13, 22], "Commodore (rank)"], [[122, 130], "One-star rank"], [[151, 164], "Pakistan Navy"], [[194, 221], "officer in tactical command"], [[258, 275], "Operation Somnath"], [[297, 303], "Dwarka"], [[307, 314], "Gujarat, India"], [[326, 336], "Indo-Pakistani war of 1965"], [[442, 449], "Karachi"], [[527, 531], "Inter-Services Public Relations"], [[545, 553], "telefilm"], [[557, 579], "Operation Dwarka"], [[712, 718], "Lahore"], [[720, 726], "Punjab, British India"], [[728, 733], "British Indian Empire"], [[805, 840], "Forman Christian College University"], [[844, 850], "Lahore"], [[887, 899], "Commissioned officer"], [[907, 924], "Royal Indian Navy (1612\u20131950)"], [[930, 944], "Sub Lieutenant"], [[991, 1004], "Burma Campaign 1942\u201343"], [[1027, 1044], "Partition of India"], [[1066, 1090], "independence of Pakistan"], [[1110, 1112], "Lieutenant"], [[1130, 1143], "Pakistan Navy"], [[1176, 1193], "U.S. Naval War College"], [[1197, 1210], "Rhodes Island"], [[1289, 1293], "Commander (rank)"], [[1313, 1329], "exchange officer"], [[1337, 1355], "United States Navy"], [[1358, 1374], "Surface warfare insignia"], [[1400, 1403], "Commander (rank)"], [[1443, 1454], "Pakistan Naval Academy"], [[1492, 1497], "Captain (naval)"], [[1525, 1544], "Ministry of Defence (Pakistan)"], [[1603, 1616], "Naval attache"], [[1624, 1643], "Embassy of Pakistan, Washington, D.C."], [[1647, 1663], "Washington, D.C."], [[1737, 1752], "Fleet Commander"], [[1790, 1804], "Pakistan Navy#Commands"], [[1826, 1836], "Indo-Pakistani war of 1965"], [[1877, 1904], "officer in tactical command"], [[1948, 1963], "Operation Somnath"], [[1990, 2006], "Indian Air Force"], [[2010, 2016], "Dwarka"], [[2018, 2025], "Gujarat"], [[2116, 2131], "Legion of Merit"], [[2151, 2178], "United States Ambassador to Pakistan"], [[2179, 2191], "Eugene M.

{"id": 16088155, "title": "Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act", "text": "Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act\n\nThe Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA) is a trade preference system by which the United States grants duty-free access to a wide range of exports from four Andean countries: Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. It was enacted on October 31, 2002 as a replacement for the similar Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA). The purpose of this preference system is to foster economic development in the Andean countries to provide alternatives to coca production. Bolivia has installed capacity to industrialize coca production and its derivatives, since coca has no narcotic effects, but the United States does not make any difference between coca and cocaine. Thus, the U.S. government eliminated this \"preference\".\n\nOn December 4, 1991, under the George H. W. Bush administration, the United States enacted the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA), eliminating tariffs on a number of products from Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Its objective was the strengthening of legal industries in these countries as alternatives to drug production and trafficking. The program was renewed on October 31, 2002 by the George W. Bush administration as the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA). Under the renewed act, Andean products exempted from tariffs increased from around 5,600 to some 6,300. ATPDEA was set to expire on December 31, 2006, but was renewed by Congress for six months, up to June 30, 2007. An extension was granted on June 28, 2007, this time for eight months, until February 29, 2008. The U.S. Congress passed a third renewal for ten months on February 28, 2008, up to December 31, 2008. In November 2008, U.S. President George W. Bush asked Congress to remove Bolivia from the agreement due to failure to cooperate in counternarcotics efforts. On December 14, 2009, the United States House of Representatives approved the extension of such plan for a period of one year. The final version of the agreement, covering Ecuadorian products only, lapsed on July 31, 2013 after Ecuador became ineligible.\n\nThe Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act has fostered a rapid growth in trade between the United States and the four Andean nations; U.S. exports to the region rose from $6.46 billion in 2002 to $11.64 billion in 2006, while imports grew from $9.61 billion to $22.51 billion in the same period. As of 2006 main Andean exports to the United States under ATPDEA were oil, apparel, copper cathodes, cut flowers, gold jewelry, asparagus, and sugar. Of the 2006 total of U.S. imports under ATPDEA, Ecuador accounted for 39%, Colombia for 36%, Peru for 24%, and Bolivia for 1%. According to a September 2006 report by the United States International Trade Commission, ATPDEA has had a negative effect on the U.S. economy and consumers as well as a small positive effect on drug-crop reduction and export-related job creation in the Andean region. A 2006 report by the United States Department of Labor stated that ATPDEA does not appear to have had a negative impact on U.S. employment with the possible exception of some sectors of the cut flower industry. Though in 2011, the United States Government began a program to compensate asparagus farmers for lost revenues called the \"Asparagus Revenue Market Loss Program.\" Much of that industry loss was a direct result of cheap imported asparagus from the Andes region.\n\n\n\n", "hyperlinks": [[[115, 131], "trade preference"], [[245, 252], "Bolivia"], [[254, 262], "Colombia"], [[264, 271], "Ecuador"], [[276, 280], "Peru"], [[350, 377], "Andean Trade Preference Act"], [[509, 513], "coca"], [[812, 829], "George H.

{"id": 18420178, "title": "Glen Wilton, Virginia", "text": "Glen Wilton, Virginia\n\nGlen Wilton is an unincorporated community in Botetourt County, Virginia, United States.\n\nCallie Furnace was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.\n\nGlen Wilton lies between the George Washington National Forest and the James River, whose headwaters are about four miles northeast with the most narrow part being approximately a mile south, near the beginning of Wood's Island, CSX Railroad and James River Division, running parallel to the river.\n\nGlen Wilton is the only community in Virginia in which there are no public roads passing through.\n\nMountain trails lead southwest to Roaring Run and north to Iron Gate. During the flood of 1985, the town of Glen Wilton was isolated for more than 24 hours, an emergency route was established through the mountain to the town of Iron Gate: however, with the heavy rains eventually even the emergency route became impassable.\n\nSettlers arrived to the area in the 1700s as indicated by land transactions. There is evidence of Native Americans living in this area as well. A couple of Indian burial sites still exist today; Everett L.Tucker, Sr., now deceased, had a collection of Indian arrowheads, pieces of pottery, various tools and other Indian artifacts that he had found while walking to these sites (he never disturbed any of the graves during his walks).\n\nLetters, often hand-delivered, were addressed as Upper James River or James River, Botetourt County. In 1837, letters sent through the mail were addressed as Clifton Forge, Botetourt County and/or Alleghany County. With the building of the Buchannan and Clifton Forge Railroad between November 16, 1876 and November 10, 1880 the train station was referenced as Wilton Depot, also for a short time during the 1880s the post office was called Carolina, named after the wife of D.S. Cook, the President of the Princess Furnace Company. By 1890 and as a result of the birth of the mining operation the area was then named Glen Wilton. Glen for the glen site it occupies and Wilton for Wilton Cook, son of D.S Cook.\n\nIn 1834, Archelius Reynolds purchased a large tract of land from Charlotte Davidson Pitzer; widow of the late Captain John Pitzer, Jr. In 1841, John Lewis Circle, Sr. also purchased land from Mrs. Pitzer. As a result, the area within a mile north and south of what would eventually be named Glen Wilton was originally owned by three families: namely, Reynolds, Circle and Wood. Archelius Reynolds died in 1863, Joseph B. Wood died in 1816, and John Lewis Circle, Sr. died in 1875.\n\nAn act approved by the General Assembly of Virginia, March 27, 1876, entitled Buchannan and Clifton Forge Railway Company to incorporate and enabled James River and Kanawha Canal Company to subscribe to the capital stock. It was proposed to construct a railway from the James River and Kanawha Canal at or near Buchannan to the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad at or near Clifton Forge. By 1884,it had become the Alleghany and Richmond Railroad, and shortly afterward, the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Company, and is now known as CSX. In May 1932, telegraph service was discontinued. Service from the four passenger/mail trains, No. 9 and No. 10 which went to and from Richmond daily and No. 32 and No. 33 which went to and from Lynchburg daily, was discontinued October 1957. Subsequently, the Glen Wilton combination station was closed and removed October 1962.\n\nThe Princess Iron Company operated in Ashland, Boyd County, Kentucky and experienced many explosions during the period of its beginnings in 1876. Company houses were built to accommodate the increasing population. Iron ore mining was the chief industry until the furnace closed in 1923, having been forced out of business by the more economical Great Lakes iron ore operations. Ore was hauled from the mines to the furnace by rail.\n\nBetween Glen Wilton and Iron Gate is the Callie Furnace which was the very first furnace erected in Botetourt County after the Civil War. It was abandoned in the early 1880s. The Princess Furnace erected in 1884 and abandoned in the 1920s. It was the only modern blast furnace in Botetourt County. In 1974, the Callie Furnace was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe town, at one time, was said to have had its own school system, as indicated in The Methodist Church Quarterly Conference Minutes, dated January 31, 1880, and mentions an afternoon school at Laurel Hill schoolhouse, which was about one mile from the parsonage. Arranged to meet the needs of individuals on this side of the river who could not attend classes at New Bethel, which was located on the other side David Wood was superintendent of Laurel Hill. In 1888, Joseph E, Circle sold land to Fincastle District School Board and was the site for the school attended by black students. In 1902, W.E. Circle, executor for the estate of John L. Circle, Jr.also sold land to the Fincastle District School Board, where a frame school building was erected and was attended by white students. This building was closed in 1919 and a brick school building was constructed for grades up to the tenth grade, however no school was held in the fall of 1919, due to the construction being not yet completed. The new school opened in January 1920. Anyone seeking to receive a diploma had to leave the area to do so. Public transportation was not provided until the 1930-31 school year for those going to Eagle Rock for their final year of high school. From March 1941 until September 1943 the Glen Wilton school was closed due to the School Board selling the property to Triton Chemical Company. After a legal battle, the school was then reopened in September 1943 for the first three grades and it remained open, for a short time, for the lower grades only, up to the fifth grade. In Spring of 1959, the Glen Wilton School was closed for good. By Fall of 1959, all elementary students were attending Eagle Rock Elementary and all high school students were then bused approximately 26 miles down Route 43 to James River High School, later an Intermediate Middle School was erected and those students attended Botetourt Intermediate School in Fincastle, today that school is known as William Clark Middle School.\n\nIn 1940, in an private effort to entice the Triton Chemical Company to build the TNT plant in Glen Wilton, the Botetourt County sold the Glen Wilton School property (assessed for $22,000) for $5.00 and agreed to close the school and the more than 70 students to Eagle Rock. Triton was to take possession of the school building and the 1.6 acres of property by April 1, 1941. However, when the community learned of this proposal, school patrons, parents and taxpayers protested. When students arrived at the school on Tuesday, March 18, 1941, they found the school closed and a bus waiting to transport them over the very dangerous Price's Bluff Road to the Eagle Rock School. Upon parents outrage and protest, not a single child climbed aboard the bus. On March 19, 1941, a delegation from Glen Wilton, along with their attorney, met with the board of supervisors in a session to further protest the proposed closing on April 1 of the Glen Wilton School and to request a resolution for proper school facilities to be provided by the time school opened in September. The board refused, leaving the delegation with the conclusion that the county was more interested in procuring industry and profit rather than the needs of the Glen Wilton school children and the community. In April 1941, school patrons and concerned taxpayers from Glen Wilton presented a petition to the county court claiming that the conveyance of the property by the school board was illegal. By September 1941 the school board and the board of supervisors could not agree on what action to take regarding a provision in the deed to Triton in which 400 men were to be employed by September 1, 1941. Stipulation in the deed provided the property be reconveyed to the county by December 1, 1941, if conditions were not met, and they had not been met. The school board passed a resolution and unanimously and agreed that no action was to be taken until December 1, unless the suit was settled before then. The board of supervisors passed a resolution they did not approve of the delayed action of the school board and went on record as supporting construction of the new school building at or near Glen Wilton. On September 27, 1941, Judge Earl L. Abbott of Botetourt County Circuit Court ruled that school boards in Virginia have no right to give away school property and ordered trial of the case. Triton Chemical Company admitted to the school board that they were unable to meet the conditions of the deed with respect to total employment by September 1 and expressed a willingness to convey the property back to the school board. Judge Abbott expressed concern over the restoration of the property and its proximity to the TNT plant. On November 5, 1941, after having two rejected proposals over the settling of the school controversy out of court, school patrons agreed to accept a proposal to build a school for Glen Wilton at a cost of $8,500 to replace the one that was deeded to Triton Chemical Company. The School Board would receive $6,000 from Triton Chemical Company for the property originally deeded to them for $5.00 and the Board of Supervisors would raise the additional $2,500.\n\nDue to the devastating explosion at the nearby plant on July 20, 1942, the new school was never built. Eventually,the plant was closed. After much encouragement from the patrons, the school reopened in September 1943 with Ella Smith Peck as the teacher and only accommodated grades one through three for that year. The bus still transported the upper grades over Price's Bluff Road; the bus route was eventually changed in September 1947.\n\nIn 1888, Joseph E. Circle sold land to the Fincastle District School Board for an elementary school for black students, from the late 1890s until 1941. The only known name for the school was the Glen Wilton Colored Elementary School and was located behind the Mount Bethel Baptist Church. It was a one-room school with a pot-bellied stove, heated by coal. Only one teacher taught all grades which only went up to the seventh grade. This teacher would come in early to start the fire and have the room heated by the time that the children arrived. School started with prayer, a song and pledge of allegiance to the flag. The black students never had the privilege of sitting at a new desk or using chalk from a new box of chalk. Everything was second hand and used formerly by the students of the white schools. The desks had some of the former students' names carved in the wood. There was no clock so the teacher and students would listen for the bell from the white school to know when school was dismissed. At the end of the day, students helped the teacher with the cleaning of the building. From the early 1920s to 1936 students went only up to the seventh grade. Some would repeat the seventh grade, not for reasons of failing, but as to continue some form of education. From 1936 until academic year 1940\u201341, the school served only the first four grades while students in grades five through seven attended the Eagle Rock Colored Elementary School, and high school students grades eight through eleven attended the Botetourt County Colored High School located in Fincastle. The black students had to walk to the far end of the Glen Wilton bridge to catch the bus.\n", "hyperlinks": [[[41, 65], "unincorporated community"], [[69, 85], "Botetourt County, Virginia"], [[87,
