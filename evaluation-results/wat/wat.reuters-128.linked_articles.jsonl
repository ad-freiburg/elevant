The business of granting loans to Poland is not as bad a business as you might imagine, senior Polish government spokesman Jerzy Urban told a news conference in Stockholm. Urban, visiting the Swedish capital to deliver a lecture at the Foreign Policy Institute, announced earlier this week that Poland would soon offer shares to private citizens in state companies in a bid to make the economy more responsive. This was part of a major economic reform to be announced in the coming weeks, he said. Urban said the main problem with his countrys foreign debt burden of 32 billion dollars was short term interest charges but the long term looked more secure. He said he hoped talks under way with the Paris Club, grouping Polands main government creditors, would shortly solve the problem of short term servicing. Urban told reporters that debt servicing was hampering the expansion of the national economy, but that the new plans for economic reform would open new vistas for Polish exports. He criticised the blocking efforts of some Western governments, whom he declined to name, for putting political considerations ahead of economic co-operation. After the lifting of U.S. Sanctions against the Polish economy we considered all political obstacles had been removed, but that has not been the case, Urban said.", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [20, 27], "id": "Q36", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q36"]}, {"span": [48, 66], "id": "Q2767140", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q2767140"]}, {"span": [171, 177], "id": "Q36", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q36"]}, {"span": [193, 205], "id": "Q4830453", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q4830453"]}, {"span": [218, 223], "id": "Q189539", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q189539"]}, {"span": [227, 233], "id": "Q36", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q36"]}, {"span": [248, 258], "id": "Q4830453", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q4830453"]}, {"span": [288, 294], "id": "Q36", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q36"]}, {"span": [316, 327], "id": "Q924053", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q924053"]}, {"span": [333, 350], "id": "Q272281", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q272281"]}, {"span": [512, 518], "id": "Q11692", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q11692"]}, {"span": [522, 538], "id": "Q2388316", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q2388316"]}, {"span": [542, 557], "id": "Q270791", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q270791"]}, {"span": [575, 586], "id": "Q159810", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q159810"]}, {"span": [629, 644], "id": "Q1205521", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q1205521"]}, {"span": [711, 718], "id": "Q124425", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q124425"]}, {"span": [737, 749], "id": "Q461319", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q461319"]}, {"span": [771, 778], "id": "Q4917", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q4917"]}, {"span": [794, 810], "id": "Q170924", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q170924"]}, {"span": [815, 828], "id": "Q41171", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q41171"]}, {"span": [866, 871], "id": "Q202875", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q202875"]}, {"span": [925, 935], "id": "Q7188", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q7188"]}, {"span": [967, 978], "id": "Q218941", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q218941"]}, {"span": [982, 992], "id": "Q384660", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q384660"]}, {"span": [1030, 1044], "id": "Q170924", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q170924"]}, {"span": [1076, 1096], "id": "Q159810", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q159810"]}, {"span": [1115, 1120], "id": "Q3391448", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q3391448"]}, {"span": [1125, 1140], "id": "Q178476", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q178476"]}, {"span": [1210, 1217], "id": "Q920600", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q920600"]}, {"span": [1226, 1233], "id": "Q160381", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q160381"]}], "evaluation_span": [0, 1504], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [227, 233], "entity_id": "Q36", "name": "Poland", "type": "Q27096213|Q4164871|Q43229"}, {"id": 1, "span": [316, 327], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 2, "span": [354, 363], "entity_id": "Q1754", "name": "Stockholm", "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 3, "span": [365, 370], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 4, "span": [429, 453], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 5, "span": [488, 494], "entity_id": "Q36", "name": "Poland", "type": "Q27096213|Q4164871|Q43229"}, {"id": 6, "span": [891, 901], "entity_id": "Q461736", "name": "Paris Club", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 7, "span": [1493, 1498], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}]}

Iraq said today its forces had beaten back the latest attacks inflicting heavy casualties. Mousavi told Tehran radio that on the whole, our advances have broken the back of the military forces of Saddam. Earlier today the Iranian news agency IRNA said Tehrans forces were stabilising new positions after their assault on Iraqi lines defending Basra, Iraqs second city.

{"id": 15, "title": "http://aksw.org/N3/Reuters-128/111#char=0,3308", "text": "The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens STN climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc FLD, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc WPM rose 1-7/8 to 67-1/8.", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [12, 16], "id": "Q30", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q30"]}, {"span": [66, 77], "id":

{"id": 17, "title": "http://aksw.org/N3/Reuters-128/113#char=0,2492", "text": "Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports. Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japans Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart. The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japans failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments. They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers. Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments. President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement. In making the annoucement, Reagan said I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade. Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japans semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues. Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagans inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs. About one-third of the deficit was with Japan. Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it. Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation. He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagans decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITIs power to control Japanese traders. The United States has excessive expectations., he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time. He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the Japanese market.", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [51, 59], "id": "Q30", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT",

VW has also said disclosed profits for 1986 will reach their 1985 level, despite provisions of a possible 480 mln marks linked to the currency affair. The figure is virtually the same as the 477 mln mark 1985 parent company net profit. When VW first confirmed the currency scandal on March 10 it said the management board would propose an unchanged 10-mark dividend to the supervisory board. A dividend of 11 marks would be proposed for the companys new preference shares. Share analysts said they saw supervisory board approval of the management board proposal as virtually a formality. Anything else would be more than a surprise, one said. Company sources said VW would have to dig into reserves to maintain the disclosed profit.

Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in which at least 15 people died. That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reduce the governments subsidy bill. However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67 dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies, a practice discouraged by the IMF. There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of meal.

{"id": 52, "title": "http://aksw.org/N3/Reuters-128/30#char=0,2886", "text": "Promising new findings in the use of a controversial experimental drug called Interleukin-2 as a cure for cancer will be published in the April 9 issue of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, according to a Wall Street analyst who has obtained an advance copy of the magazine. Among interleukins principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp CTUS, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp IMNX, based in Seattle, Wash. The journal, to be released late today, contains two articles reporting high remission rates several cancer types. The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search for a successful immunotherapy for cancer. Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally produced by living cells in the laboratory. The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its ravaging side effects. One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after it changed the way in which the drug is administered. In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities Stuart Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine. For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital care, according to the article. In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum. In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness of the drugs side effects as originally administered. Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search for successful immunotherapy for cancer, said the editorial, signed by John Durant of Philadelphias Chase Cancer Center. These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely did not describe successful practical approaches ready for widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients, the editorial said. On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, a successful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then we may be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction in the immunuotherapy of cancer, the editorial concluded.", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [53, 70], "id": "Q5421154", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q5421154"]}, {"span": [78,

Southerns Georgia Power Co subsidiary has a 45.7 pct interest in the plant and estimated earlier this year it would cost a total of 8.87 billion dlrs. Last year, the plants owners pledged to Georgia regulators they would limit the cost passed on to rate payers to 8.4 billion dlrs. The Southern spokeswoman said the company feels the report by OBrien-Kreitzberg is flawed and biased. She said the report was released yesterday by the state attorney general. Responding to the report today, Georgia Power Chairman Robert W. Scherer told a news conference the conclusions drawn by the firm are not only wrong -- they also reflect the same bias against nuclear power that these auditors have demonstrated in similar cases accross the country. Saying he was not suggesting Georgia power was without fault, Scherer said the audit identified several things I wish we had done differently. Scherer pointed out a report OBrien-Kreitzberg submitted to Georgia regulators in March 1986 projected Georgia Power would not finish Plant Vogtle unit one before the end of 1987. Noting unit one is finished, and we expect it to be in commercial operationg by June, he said the firms latest report ignored the earlier projection, gave the utility no credit for the completion and actually penalized us by suggesting that costs to maintain t he schedule be disallowed. Scherer said the latest audit alleges Georgia Power could have saved 95 mln dlrs if it had stopped using four shifts, seven days a week to speed construction three years sooner. He said this would have delayed completion of the plant for another year and it would have cost several hunderd million dlrs more. Noting the audit said costs were increased 600 mln dlrs by schedule delays totaling 20.5 months, he said First, we have the best concrete placement record in the industry, Second new government regulations after the Three Mile Island incident significantly increased construction time.", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 8], "id": "Q181487", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT",

{"id": 55, "title": "http://aksw.org/N3/Reuters-128/33#char=0,3486", "text": "Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [131,

Ford last week extended to April 30 from March 12 its incentive program on its compact trucks and the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable cars.", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 13], "id": "Q44294", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q44294"]}, {"span": [62, 74], "id": "Q215601", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q215601"]}, {"span": [123, 138], "id": "Q1689021", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q1689021"]}, {"span": [140, 144], "id": "Q44294", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q44294"]}, {"span": [177, 182], "id": "Q173177", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q173177"]}, {"span": [284, 292], "id": "Q41273", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q41273"]}, {"span": [330, 339], "id": "Q852835", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q852835"]}, {"span": [345, 353], "id": "Q2044250", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q2044250"]}, {"span": [368, 390], "id": "Q765188", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q765188"]}, {"span": [404, 410], "id": "Q693464", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q693464"]}, {"span": [411, 417], "id": "Q48995577", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q48995577"]}, {"span": [456, 464], "id": "Q190087", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q190087"]}, {"span": [468, 480], "id": "Q16259746", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q16259746"]}, {"span": [489, 493], "id": "Q44294", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q44294"]}, {"span": [516, 521], "id": "Q19830062", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q19830062"]}, {"span": [530, 535], "id": "Q173177", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q173177"]}, {"span": [576, 582], "id": "Q43193", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q43193"]}, {"span": [591, 595], "id": "Q44294", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q44294"]}, {"span": [596, 602], "id": "Q938795", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q938795"]}, {"span": [607, 614], "id": "Q613883", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q613883"]}, {"span": [615, 620], "id": "Q953798", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q953798"]}], "evaluation_span": [0, 626], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [0, 13], "entity_id": "Q44294", "name": "Ford Motor Company", "type": "Q2424752|Q431289|Q43229"}, {"id": 1, "span": [140, 144], "entity_id": "Q44294", "name": "Ford Motor Company", "type": "Q2424752|Q431289|Q43229"}, {"id": 2, "span": [489, 493], "entity_id": "Q44294", "name": "Ford Motor Company", "type": "Q2424752|Q431289|Q43229"}]}

{"id": 72, "title": "http://aksw.org/N3/Reuters-128/49#char=0,5148", "text": "Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [10, 20],

There were only four survivors when the aircraft crashed into a mountain north of Tokyo. The report said inadequate inspection of the aircraft by Japanese inspectors after the repairs was another factor in the crash. The crew were cleared of any responsibility for the disaster. The report, which was sent on March 23 to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board for comment, should be released in late May. Under an international convention the draft must be submitted for final comments to the relevant authorities. Boeing spokesmen were unavailable for comment.

On Monday, the stock tumbled four points after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court decision that cut Texacos bond in the 10.3 billion dlr legal dispute with Pennzoil Co PZL to one billion dlrs. Yesterday, a Texas court granted a temporary injunction on the bond issue pending a hearing next week. The current litigation arose from Texacos buyout of Getty Oil Co in 1984. Pennzoil sued, arguing its earlier agreement to buy Getty was binding. Two Texas state courts upheld Pennzoils position. Randol, noting that the stock has suffered a great deal in the two years since the litigation was filed, said we recognize the legal problems but think investors have overdone it.

As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned, they are rumors and were not commenting on rumors, spokesman Michel Dufour told Reuters in response to a query. All the information that has been given out publicly is that, yes, Dominion Textile is interested in making an acquisition that big...probably based on that people are starting all sorts of rumors, he said. Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a rumor, but said the company was not prepared to comment further. Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bell was out of town and unavailable for comment. Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln- U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln- U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition. Dufour said the company has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington Industries was one of them. Burlingtons stock rose sharply this morning on the report, which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor Asher Edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making a takeover offer. Dominion Textile, which reported operating profit of 11.1 mln Canadian dlrs last year on sales of 926.5 mln dlrs, has repeatedly said it will concentrate on expanding into the U.S. The company has said it plans to diversify into new product and market areas in addition to expanding its textile operations.", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 20], "id": "Q3034907", "recognized_by": "WAT",

The sources said the depressed world market had been one of the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the 11-member CPA which began on Monday. They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his effort to support prices. Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the market soon. Prices, under the weight of three successive cocoa surpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager has to buy cocoa under stock rules. The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set range by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise. The worlds cocoa price at present is just not interesting, commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer. Another source said that with much of the 1986/87 (October-September) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales in the near term concerns essentially next years harvest. The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry in Brazil, the worlds number two producer, is in private hands. This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major West African producers, where sales are made or authorized by commodity marketing boards. The CPA includes the worlds top three producers, Ivory Coast, Brazil and Ghana, and accounts for 80 pct of all output.

{"id": 103, "title": "http://aksw.org/N3/Reuters-128/77#char=0,2444", "text": "J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil. That decision, spurred by Brazils suspension of interest payments on February 20, reduced the quarters net income by 20 mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the first three months of 1986. Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln dlrs in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and underwriting of Euromarket securities. Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether Morgans trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket. On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln. Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln. Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct. If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9 mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added. After the provision for loan losses, Morgans allowance for credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier. It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49 mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier. Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarters end were 583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from 303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to personnel costs, Morgan said.", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 22], "id": "Q2633403",

Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia, told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this years estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost. He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage problems. Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes, theoretically sufficient for the crop. But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul had between them 70 pct of the nations capacity, but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production. The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage capacity. Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nations grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space. In addition to the poor distribution of storage units, there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain, Brito said. Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the crops. The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports, which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [97, 103], "id": "Q191118", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q191118"]}, {"span": [164, 172], "id": "Q46741", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q46741"]}, {"span": [249, 255], "id": "Q191118", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q191118"]}, {"span": [280, 284], "id": "Q11451", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q11451"]}, {"span": [295, 301], "id": "Q191118", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q191118"]}, {"span": [358, 362], "id": "Q552431", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q552431"]}, {"span": [377, 387], "id": "Q213753", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q213753"]}, {"span": [433, 441], "id": "Q2070979", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q2070979"]}, {"span": [454, 472], "id": "Q66221", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q66221"]}, {"span": [483, 489], "id": "Q191118", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q191118"]}, {"span": [520, 528], "id": "Q5090", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q5090"]}, {"span": [594, 604], "id": "Q20617590", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q20617590"]}, {"span": [608, 617], "id": "Q174", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q174"]}, {"span": [619, 625], "id": "Q15499", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q15499"]}, {"span": [644, 647], "id": "Q1060042", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q1060042"]}, {"span": [918, 923], "id": "Q235352", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q235352"]}, {"span": [932, 936], "id": "Q11006", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q11006"]}, {"span": [941, 946], "id": "Q11575", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q11575"]}, {"span": [1030, 1043], "id": "Q66221", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q66221"]}, {"span": [1069, 1081], "id": "Q867147", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q867147"]}, {"span": [1085, 1098], "id": "Q401404", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q401404"]}, {"span": [1109, 1120], "id": "Q218941", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q218941"]}, {"span": [1138, 1150], "id": "Q66221", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q66221"]}, {"span": [1172, 1177], "id": "Q2995529", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q2995529"]}, {"span": [1181, 1186], "id": "Q1854464", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q1854464"]}, {"span": [1235, 1240], "id": "Q2995529", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q2995529"]}, {"span": [1272, 1282], "id": "Q168247", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q168247"]}, {"span": [1286, 1293], "id": "Q43193", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q43193"]}, {"span": [1307, 1316], "id": "Q5090", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q5090"]}, {"span": [1328, 1333], "id": "Q5970087", "recognized_by": "WAT", "linked_by": "WAT", "candidates": ["Q5970087"]}], "evaluation_span": [0, 1490], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [108, 128], "entity_id": "Q4294676", "name": "Ministry of Agriculture of Brazil", "type": "Q43229"}, {"id": 1, "span": [164, 178], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 2, "span": [194, 202], "entity_id": "Q2844", "name": "Bras\u00edlia", "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 3, "span": [209, 216], "entity_id": "Q130879", "name": "Reuters", "type": "Q2424752|Q43229"}, {"id": 4, "span": [443, 449], "entity_id": "Q155", "name": "Brazil", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229"}, {"id": 5, "span": [534, 539], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 6, "span": [608, 617], "entity_id": "Q175", "name": "S\u00e3o Paulo", "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 7, "span": [619, 625], "entity_id": "Q15499", "name": "Paran\u00e1", "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 8, "span": [630, 647], "entity_id": "Q40030", "name": "Rio Grande do Sul", "type": "Q27096213"}, {"id": 9, "span": [884, 889], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}, {"id": 10, "span": [1242, 1247], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER"}]}

It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can expect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least the crop is off to a very good start, he said. Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600 hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugar, substantially more than the countrys combined A and B quota of 872,000 tonnes. This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000 hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000 tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota C sugar produced. Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been allotted quotas.

In the 1986 annual repoprt, he said lengthy negotiations had brought agreement with the Tokyo and London Stock Exchanges for fuller, but still not complete, access to market data through Reuter services. Many other markets maintain restrictions, he added. Hogg said members of some markets appear to believe that information restrictions protected their interests. In other cases, exchanges seem to be limiting the distribution of data in order to provide competitive advantage to their own commercial information businesses. He also noted that despite increasing liberalisation in the telecommunications field, some countries continue to protect their state monopolies at the expense of other economic sectors. Reuter dealing services remain excluded from such countries. As a result, banking communities serving entire economies are put at a competitive disadvantage, he added. Reuters increased its 1986 pre-tax profit by 39 pct from the previous year to 130.1 mln stg on a 43 pct rise in revenues to 620.9 mln stg. Earnings per ordinary share were up 47 pct to 19.4p.

Id like the benefit of the Winans decision before deciding on a definition, Shad told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing. Shad was refering to the appeal by former Wall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans of his conviction on insider trading charges for telling a friend in advance what stocks he was going to write about in his column. The stocks usually went up or down in price depending on Winans recommendation. He said insider trading accounted for only 11 percent of the SECs enforcement activities last year despite the publicity given to recent major cases. Insider trading makes up only a tiny fraction of one pct of the 50 billion dlrs of daily securities trading, Shad said.

He told a press conference after the release of an initial prospectus for the float that the issue would be offered to U.K. Institutions, company employees and the general public. As in previous flotations, clawback arrangements would be made if public subscriptions exceeded initial allocations. He declined to say how the shares would be allocated beyond saying that a significant proportion would go to institutions. A decision on what percentage would go to each sector would be made shortly before the sale price was announced on April 28. Minimum subscription would be for 400 shares with payment in two tranches, again a method broadly in line with previous privatisations. Chairman Sir Francis Tombs denied suggestions that Rolls was a stock that should be left to the institutions. He noted that although the aircraft industry was cyclical, Rolls had several operations -- such as spare parts and military equipment -- that evened out the swings. Rolls 1986 research and development expenditure in 1986 was 255 mln stg and could be expected in the future to vary according to changes in turnover. He noted that net research and development expenditure was written off in the year it occurred, a policy that received inadequate recognition in one or two of the more extravagant forecasts of future profits. He made no forecast himself. In 1986, Rolls reported that pretax profit rose 48 pct to 120 mln stg on turnover 12 pct higher at 1.8 billion.", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 6], "id": "Q166656", "recognized_by": "WAT",

DSM chairman Hans van Liemt told journalists We have done our homework. Were ready. It is up to the state now. He said a public sale of 30 pct of DSMs assets in 1988 was not unlikely, but the timing of the sell-off was entirely in the hands of Parliament. Dutch Finance Minister Onno Ruding is known to be a proponent of privatisation, and the centre-right government coalition mentioned plans to privatise DSM in its policy declaration last autumn.
