We've been using condoms, but my boyfriend wants me to go on the Pill. I don't want to go back to it aged 48, when my chances of getting pregnant are almost non-existent. Wouldn't the rhythm method be sufficient?\n\nANSWER: Now here's an ironic thing: if you were trying to fall pregnant at the age of 48, the medics would tell you that your chances of doing so naturally were rather less than those of being hit by an asteroid.\n\nSuggest, however, that you're thinking of being laidback about contraception because you're far too old to conceive and the story changes dramatically. Everyone will cite a woman they know on the far side of her 40s who stopped bothering with protection and suddenly found herself knocked up.\n\nThey might also mention the fact that middle-aged women are the fastest-growing demographic seeking abortions, and that much of what's said about female fertility is wrong.\n\nSo, when I tell you to be cautious, I really mean it. If you're going to try the rhythm method, you need to be careful monitoring your temperature and ovulation.\n\nYou also need to be prepared to exercise extreme self-control during fertile periods - which is also when you'll be feeling most desire. Good luck with that.\n\nNone of this means that you have to go back on the Pill. There's a wide range of alternatives. The popular Mirena coil releases smaller doses of hormones than the contraceptive Pill and safeguards against pregnancy for five years.\n\nI would advise a trip to your nearest family planning clinic, where a specialist will talk you through all the best options.\n\nSend your questions to Rowan in confidence at lifeandstylereaders@dailymail.co.uk\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 13], "id": "Q7371805", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q7371805"]}, {"span": [1520, 1526], "id": "Q1628262", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1628262", "Q416950"]}, {"span": [1590, 1594], "id": "Q817281", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1097859", "Q122224", "Q13522856", "Q17017720", "Q206077", "Q2255024", "Q237781", "Q2924619", "Q3344800", "Q4877890", "Q519410", "Q6742555", "Q691252", "Q7194090", "Q7194092", "Q7194106", "Q7194170", "Q7305365", "Q7757121", "Q781953", "Q817281", "Q899702", "Q96399371"]}, {"span": [1794, 1799], "id": "Q7371805", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1040310", "Q12646464", "Q146198", "Q157964", "Q16090108", "Q1647656", "Q1799872", "Q1864710", "Q3013195", "Q3525459", "Q3941971", "Q505510", "Q507966", "Q5082192", "Q5229730", "Q5242506", "Q5262862", "Q5290639", "Q533345", "Q5344027", "Q579136", "Q633169", "Q65121827", "Q7371776", "Q7371800", "Q7371802", "Q7371805", "Q7761643", "Q7873572", "Q7873574"]}], "evaluation_span": [917, 1411], "labels": []}

Of 2,506 ninth- and 10th-grade students who took the California Standards test in algebra: 0 percent tested advanced, 3 percent tested proficient and 97 percent failed the test.\n\nHow is it possible for a public school system to so liberally spend more than half a billion dollars and still fail to educate 94 percent or more students of all racial backgrounds? Does anyone believe providing more money to these public school systems will enhance these students' academic performance in mathematics?\n\nDuring my principalship at American Indian Public Charter School, we spent less than $8,000 per student, proving that schools did not need more money. We served a student population that is on average 98 percent minority, with 97 percent receiving free or reduced-price lunch and many who are non-English speakers and from single-parent families. AIPCS students spend three to four hours a day working on mathematics and English-language arts.\n\nIn 2009, they excelled in academics, physical fitness and any standardized test that they were given. The hard work of these students and staff has paid off with virtually all of our eighth-graders testing advanced in algebra, including 100 percent of our eighth-grade black students, Mexican-American students and American Indian students.\n\nBefore I became its principal, people called American Indian Public Charter School the zoo. The neighbors hated it. They couldn't stand the behavior of the students, who, with little supervision or control, wreaked havoc in the area.\n\nUnfortunately, the students who decided to attend the school did not receive the academics and structure they so direly needed. The school was in many ways a failure, a joke, a sham.\n\nWhen I took over as principal in 2000, it was the worst middle school in Oakland. I told the board I would take the job only if they let me go my own way and do what I thought was best. I implemented a golden rule at American Indian Public Charter School for staff, students and families: If you act like a winner, you'll be treated like a winner. If you act like a fool, you'll be treated like a fool. The charter school is now one of the top-scoring schools in the state and is nationally recognized.\n\nThe United States spends more money on public education than any other country in the world. Yet, we still have a secondary public education system that ranks with Third World countries in preparing our children in English-language arts, mathematics, science and social studies.\n\nWashington, D.C.; Detroit, Michigan; Los Angeles, California; Kansas City, Missouri; and numerous other cities throughout the United States are producing the same poor academic results at an extraordinary cost to the taxpayer and a tremendous academic loss to our students and country.\n\nI believe all the money in the world would not be enough to improve schools run by incompetent public school administrators. We need proven leaders who can prepare our children to be competitive members in a free-market society.\n\nThe American public has been conned into believing that public schools need more money. Have you ever met a public school administrator who said they have enough money?\n\nPresident Obama is moving in the \"right\" direction by reforming public schools to be held responsible to the American public in return for more money. It's very clear that most Americans want to ensure that accountability be attached to the stimulus money that is being awarded to all institutions, including public schools.\n\nNext time you hear school officials or politicians begging for more money, ask them how large the district's budget is and how many students are enrolled in their district. Then you do the math. After all, it's your money they want to take.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ben Chavis.\n\nAll About Education Issues \u2022 U.S. Department of Education \u2022

Kowalski, Ph.D., President and CEO of JDRF, on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorization of the Tandem Control-IQ algorithm for use as part of a hybrid closed-loop system\n\nNEW YORK, Dec. 13, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- \"Regulatory authorization of the Tandem Control-IQ algorithm for use as part of a hybrid closed-loop system is a huge win for the type 1 diabetes (T1D) community and a critical step forward in making day-to-day life better for people living with the disease.\n\nAs part of our mission to improve the lives of those affected by T1D, JDRF has been a leader in artificial pancreas (AP) research for more than 15 years and partnered with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to establish regulatory pathways to ensure AP technology gets into the hands of people with T1D as quickly as possible.\n\nThis is the second hybrid closed-loop system on the market and the first algorithm authorized as an interoperable automated glycemic controller, which means it could be a component of an open-protocol system. People with different devices could use the algorithm and manage their glucose levels in a way that works best for them. JDRF research grants supported the development of this algorithm, and our advocacy supported the Special Diabetes Program, which funded its clinical testing.\n\nUntil we find cures, we are continuing to support the development of new technologies and treatments to improve blood sugar management so people with T1D can live healthier and more manageable lives. JDRF is also fighting to ensure people with this disease have more choices and better access to the diabetes management tools that work best for them through our Coverage2Control campaign. Today's announcement is yet another reason why health plans should cover all FDA authorized diabetes management tools, to help people with T1D manage this life-threatening disease. In particular, JDRF calls upon UnitedHealthcare to lift its restrictions which limit options of insulin pumps available to its members.\"\n\n\nJDRF is the leading global organization funding type 1 diabetes (T1D) research. Our mission is to accelerate life-changing breakthroughs to cure, prevent and treat T1D and its complications. To accomplish this, JDRF has invested more than $2.2 billion in research funding since our inception. We are an organization built on a grassroots model of people connecting in their local communities, collaborating regionally for efficiency and broader fundraising impact and uniting on a national stage to pool resources, passion and energy. We collaborate with academic institutions, policymakers and corporate and industry partners to develop and deliver a pipeline of innovative therapies to people living with T1D. Our staff and volunteers throughout the United States and our six international affiliates are dedicated to advocacy, community engagement and our vision of a world without T1D.

{"id": 2009236249, "title": "20090814 - Respite for reptiles as demand drops for skins", "text": "Respite for reptiles as demand drops for skins\n\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) - As conspicuous consumption loses some of its cachet during the recession, the swamp's most conspicuous consumers have less to fear from humans.\n\nInstead of taking the half-million alligator eggs from marshes and swamps that they had in recent years, alligator farmers are expected to pull in 30,000 this year, with a final tally in December. And state wildlife officials expect the 2009 harvest of adult gators, which begins Aug. 26, to amount to a small fraction of last year's 35,500.\n\nNobody's buying, said Rapides Parish nuisance-alligator control officer Ron Guy. He's among more than 60 people around the state who get called if a gator wanders out of its bayou and into a local golf course or backyard. Their pay is the right to sell the skins.\n\nGators bought Louisiana farmers and hunters $71 million in 2007, modest revenue even at that peak. This year, revenue is expected to be closer to $10 million in 2009, a drop like locals say they've never seen.\n\n\"My father was in the fur and alligator business. I started buying fur and alligators when I was 13 years old,\" said Wayne Sagrera, 65, who has about 75,000 alligators at Vermilion Gator Farm Inc. in Abbeville. \"I've seen some slowdowns. But nothing to compare to this.\"\n\nPeople who are still buying expensive accessories have shifted away from conspicuous consumption - for instance, Jimmy Choo is selling obvious faux-crocodile as well as the real thing, fashion consultant Robert Burke said.\n\n\"There's certainly a sensitivity in the luxury market of anything that is too much luxury, and alligator would fit into that category,\" Burke said.\n\nHis income from hauling off nuisance alligators let Guy leave construction work six years ago, but he's back now - and running out far less often for alligators.\n\n\"Instead of going on every call as soon as it comes in, you prioritize them,\" Guy said. \"If it's under a car in the Sonic parking lot, you've got to go.\"\n\nDemand for crocodilian leather, including the large alligator and crocodile skins used for handbags and the caiman leather used for cowboy boots, dropped more than 40 percent worldwide between the first quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009, according to Choon Heong Koh, executive director of Singapore tannery Heng Long International Ltd.\n\nDemand for small, farmed hides used for watchbands fell even more dramatically - 80 percent or more, he said in an e-mail to The Associated Press.\n\nLuxury watches are \"such a high-end item - when those people stop spending money you get real nervous,\" said Dave Travers, owner of Sebring Custom Tanning in Sebring, Fla.\n\nEven John Price - whose Insta-Gator Ranch and Hatchery in Covington gets 40 percent of its income from tours, including egg-hatching tours that start in mid-August each year - has suffered. He usually raises about 1,500 alligators a year to sell their hides. Instead of collecting 1,500 eggs this year from the wild, he collected 200, largely because people want to hold eggs while they hatch.\n\n\"We have customers who have booked the right to hatch an alligator. I don't want to call them back and say, 'Sorry, we're not doing it,'\" Price said.\n\nAbout 30 of those 200 'gators will wind up back in the wild. As part of the program that brought alligators back from the brink of extinction, Louisiana's 59 licensed alligator farmers must return about 15 percent of those they raise to the swamps they came from.\n\nThat's about the same share that would survive non-human predators during their first four years in swamps and marshes.\n\n\nOn the Net:\n\nLouisiana Alligator Advisory Council:\n\n\nLa.

{"id": 20174569198, "title": "20171102 - Trolls 'bump shame' Duchess of Cambridge", "text": "Trolls 'bump shame' Duchess of Cambridge\n\nCruel internet trolls have 'bump shamed' the Duchess of Cambridge for her lack of pregnancy curves after her first public appearance since announcing her pregnancy.\n\nKate, 35, attended a reception at Buckingham Palace for World Mental Health Day on Tuesday, after taking six weeks off while she battled hyperemesis gravidarum - a severe form of morning sickness - revealing just a hint of a baby bump.\n\nWhile many commenters on Kensington Palace's Instagram account complimented Kate on how well she looked, others were eager to point out her tiny stomach with one saying: 'I can't believe she's pregnant, she looks too thin.'\n\nOthers even claimed that they look more pregnant than the Duchess does, questioning how she can still look so slim.\n\nHowever, experts hit back at the comments saying that 'bump shaming' can cause unnecessary anxiety for mothers-to-be.\n\nLesley Gilchrist, practising midwife and co-founder of My Expert Midwife, said: 'Bump shaming can really damage a woman's body confidence and cause needless worry and anxiety over the health of their baby.\n\nIt's important to remember that the bump size is just the size of the baby's \"packaging\" and has no bearing on the size of their baby.'\n\nPeggy Osborne, a midwife at The Women's Health Clinic who also teaches NHS antenatal classes added: 'There is a lot of pressure on new mothers to have the perfect bump, especially when you have had to announce it perhaps before you were ready.\n\n'But there is no real use comparing one pregnancy to a previous one, as the embryo could implant differently or eating habits may have changed - especially with hyperemesis.'\n\nKate is estimated to be less than 20 weeks into her pregnancy, which was announced in August before she reached the crucial 12 week stage.\n\nPeggy added: 'At this stage in the pregnancy the uterus is being pushed higher in to the abdomen but baby is yet to cause any real \"bump,\" typically any additional roundness is just fluid.'\n\nUnlike regular morning sickness, it doesn't fade away with time and can leave some women bedbound as they are unable to keep food or drink down.\n\nIt is also considered to be the second leading cause of hospitalisation during pregnancy and can lead to dehydration - dangerous to both the mother and child.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [20, 40], "id": "Q10479", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates":

Nast International will launch a new business-focused fashion title in an attempt to tap into new sources of revenue.\n\nVogue Business will be a digital-only publication aimed at fashion industry professionals.\n\nAnalysts say the move is part of a wider shift in the media sector toward niche publications.\n\nThe launch comes as the US media industry goes through another round of job cuts.\n\nCond\u00e9 Nast International said the new title will cover the \"market currents, cultural movements, trends and technologies that will impact the fashion industry.\"\n\nVogue Business is the first product to emerge from the firm's \"incubator\" which develops new products and services for the company.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Vogue editor Anna Wintour at Paris Fashion week.\n\n\"We are constantly evaluating how we work across countries and brands and how we develop our products to expand our global leadership in the fashion, luxury and lifestyle spaces,\" Cond\u00e9 Nast International said in a statement.\n\nThe company also publishes Wired, GQ and Vanity Fair.\n\nThe new title will be edited by Lauren Indvik and global contributors will include Suzy Menkes, it said.\n\nThe company said 7,000 industry professionals were involved in beta-testing Vogue Business, including senior executives at some of the world's biggest fashion brands.\n\nMark Mulligan from MIDiA Research said the new title appears to be part of a move to focus on smaller, high-value audiences rather than large-scale readerships supported by ads.\n\n\"Where more mainstream titles struggle for relevance and readership, print edition niche magazines have proven to have strong, long term appeal with their respective niches,\" he said.\n\nMany media companies have struggled

{"id": 2011294773, "title": "20111109 - Review of Glee, \"The First Time\"", "text": "Review of Glee, \"The First Time\"\n\n\nLast American virgins: Rachel and Blaine contemplate some, er, character research in \"The First Time.\"\n\nSpoilers for last night's Glee below:\n\nRight up front, let me say that \"The First Time\" was the best episode, overall, of Glee season three. Before we get to the good stuff, though, we had to get through about fifteen minutes of complete contrivance. So let me gripe about those first, because I'm kind of a jerk that way.\n\n\"The First Time\" is about sex and virginity, hence the name. And lest we miss that theme, it begins by morphing Artie into an overconfident, pushy director who questions Rachel and Blaine's ability to play Maria and Tony without having become Jets all the way, as it were. (Later, he decides to counsel Coach Beiste, diagnosing her problem with intimacy. Artie, it seems, is now Dr. Drew Pinsky.)\n\nThe scene screams of a forced conflict designed to drive the plot: it's as if Artie has become Will, assigning Rachel and Blaine the loss of their virginity by writing SEX on a whiteboard as their weekly project. I don't buy it: I don't buy [1] that Artie would become fixed on this idea (despite the intro about his trying to fake his way through directing by having strong opinions) [2] that Rachel and Blaine would take it to heart (\"How are we, as virgins, supposed to follow that?\") and [3] two faculty members, however uncomfortable with the topic for their own reasons, would step back while a school musical director urged his stars to have sex for the good of the performance.\n\nThe thing is, you don't need a contrived reason to make an episode of Glee about sex and sexual pressure. Here's a perfectly good reason: the show takes place in a high school. Sex as a topic is kind of a given. And once we got past that setup - and that unfortunate Warblers Billy Joel video - this was a really fine episode with some genuine, believable character moments.\n\nLots of them too, and yet probably the best thing I can say for \"First Time\" is that it serviced a good half-dozen storylines but did not feel at all crowded. (Though her story got third billing, Dot Jones continued stunning work as Coach Beiste, one of Glee's few characters who can be over-the-top funny and moving at the same time, rather than in alternation.) Kurt and Rachel's respective virginity stories, for instance, were rooted in very real, existing relationship dynamics that needed no dues-ex-Artie to prod them.\n\nIn Kurt's case, it was about his wanting to assert his identity as an out gay teen, but also his autonomy to be the kind of gay teen he wants to be: in his case, a sweet, even corny romantic-which itself is a rebellion against highly sexualized teen culture in general (manifest in many things, Glee among them) and against a specific sexualized subculture within the gay community (here represented by seeming Gossip-Girl outtake Sebastian, and the saddest gay bar in Ohio).\n\nThis, not any \"Will they do it?\" debate, was was made his storyline for me: in its own way, his fight with Blaine in the parking lot was as much a statement as his coming out itself. It's his way of asserting that to him, being gay is not simply defined by sex, it's defined by love. And his tete-a-tete with newly-minted bear Karofsky, a nice epilogue to that storyline from last season, built on that: it underscored the point that being gay does not in itself settle your identity, it's simply one more step in figuring out what your identity is ultimately going to be, where you fit in.\n\nRachel and Finn's will-they-won't-they, meanwhile, hung on Rachel's insecurity as a performer - it is a Rachel story, after all - but also on their often-unspoken realization that there are forces that may push them apart after graduation. This got brought to a head for Finn in his disappointment with the Ohio State recruiter; hearing that he's reached his \"ceiling\" was a harsh and very real moment, and Cory Monteith really sold Finn's feeling of being helpless and overmatched, unable to keep up with Rachel as she moves on to bigger things. I'm not sure how romantic it is to see them end up in bed essentially as pity sex (I half-expected Rachel to say, \"Now I'm doing this for the right reason: Because I feel sorry for you\"). But it rooted the decision in their larger story: it's one way they can be together that's still in their control.\n\nOh, yeah: I guess I should say something about the whole plot-about-teens-having-sex business. Um, it's high school? I know some people hold stories set in school to a different standard, but I have a hard time with the idea that a TV show should (or can) try to influence teenagers\" sexual behavior-much less influence it toward never, ever having sex until marriage (or at least graduation).\n\nThe episode said a lot of things about sex, negative and positive, but the bottom line was that it made out first-time sex to be a big deal. That seems about right.\n\nNow a quick hail of bullets:\n\n* I hadn't thought there was much Glee could do to switch up its musical format, but I very much liked the device of using rehearsal performances of West Side songs to comment on the action. I don't know that the series can repeat the device once the musical is over, but I do hope it continues to mix things up.\n\n* Likewise, while there was a certain TV level of production in the musical itself, it was a good move to make the effort to have it sound like an actual high school production in an auditorium, rather than a highly-produced iTunes download.\n\n* \"Poison Arrow\" is easily my favorite ABC song - from back when I was a young person, before the Great War - so it was a little sad to see it now used as an auditory shorthand for \"seedy Ohio nightclub.\" But I cannot say it was entirely inappropriate.\n\n* I'm not sure if the musical scenes are meant to convey the sense that Santana is currently blowing everyone else in New Directions away, but that's how it looks to me.\n\n* Will and Sue? Did not miss them one bit.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [10, 14], "id": "Q152178", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q127872", "Q13747402", "Q152178",

{"id": 20181523890, "title": "20180220 - Feminists want Mila Kunis to turn down a Harvard award", "text": "Feminists want Mila Kunis to turn down a Harvard award\n\nA Harvard University theater group with an all-male cast is under fire from those who say it should allow women onstage - and they're asking Mila Kunis to take up their cause.\n\nDetractors are calling on the Hasty Pudding troupe to start casting women and to update sexist portrayals of women. Amid the debate, some are calling on Kunis to reconsider her acceptance of the group's Woman of the Year award on Thursday to protest the exclusion.\n\n'It would be a wonderful thing for her to not accept this award, to say this is gender inequality,' said Liz Kantor, a senior studying molecular and cellular biology, who auditioned for this year's show.\n\n'There are women on campus who are more than willing to take advantage of these opportunities, yet they're still being excluded.'\n\nTickets to the Man of the Year roast honoring Paul Rudd cost $200 - but the price for the Woman of the Year event are just $80.\n\nHasty Pudding is known for bawdy comedic revues that feature men in drag playing female characters, a longstanding tradition in the group, which says it was formed in 1795.\n\nBut more recently, women have sought acting roles in the student-written parodies, which are shown in Massachusetts, New York and Bermuda and have helped launch careers for former students ranging from Jack Lemmon to Broadway composer Larry O'Keefe.\n\nKantor is among about 20 women who auditioned for this year's show as a form of protest, an idea started by two women in 2015. Each year, the women have promptly been cut.\n\nWomen can instead take behind-the-scenes jobs, including writing the shows or working on the technical crew, the group says on its website.\n\nStudents on Hasty Pudding's executive board, which is led by a woman and includes several female members, declined to comment. Overall, about half the 50 students involved with the group are women.\n\nThe troupe has been criticized for its all-male cast before, including in a 2016 petition from dozens of former members.\n\nIts shows take cues from the Shakespearean era, when men played all roles. Harvard itself admitted only male undergraduates until a partial merger with Radcliffe College in 1977.\n\nThe Man and Woman of the Year awards precede the kickoff of the annual revue, which includes more than 30 performances in February and March.\n\nKunis, whose credits include 'That '70s Show' and 'Black Swan,' has spoken out sharply against sexism in entertainment, including in a 2016 essay. She did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSome students and alumni have also said this year's Man of the Year, Paul Rudd, should stand up against the exclusion. A message seeking comment was sent to a representative for the actor.\n\nOthers recently named Woman of the Year by the group include Octavia Spencer and Amy Poehler, who cracked a biting joke about the group's exclusion of women when she accepted the honor in 2015.\n\n'You know it's time for a change when the Augusta National Golf Club has lapped you in terms of being progressive,' Poehler said, referring to the Georgia club's 2012 decision to admit women.\n\nSome critics are also challenging the portrayal of women in the revues, which have featured characters with names like 'Donna My Knees' and 'Sheila Rowsya.'\n\n'It just magnifies the misogyny that men are portraying these characters,' said Kantor, of West Nyack, New York. 'They're usually just the most blatant stereotypes you could think of.'\n\nWomen who have pushed for a place in the cast say students are split. Some say women in drag wouldn't be as funny, and some say the all-male cast is a tradition that should be protected.\n\nHasty Pudding started as a social club, taking its name from the porridge members brought to meetings. The school recognizes it as a student group but doesn't necessarily endorse its views, a school spokesman said. Officials declined to comment on its casting policies.\n\nBut the administration has been working to curb groups that exclude members based on gender, including secretive all-male groups known as 'final clubs.'\n\nStudents who join single-gender social groups, for example, are banned from campus leadership positions, but Hasty Pudding is considered an arts group, not a social group, and isn't subject to the rule.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [15, 25], "id": "Q37628", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q37628"]}, {"span": [41, 48], "id": "Q13371",

'You're looking at yourself and taking a photo while looking at everyone.'\n\nShe explained: 'When I post a selfie and someone comments: \"Oh, sure, go ahead and reclaim your sexuality, I got my rocks off,\" that's not my problem.'\n\nIn Harper's, for which she posed nude on horseback, Emily praised social media as 'a format where you can be so direct with an audience'.\n\nShe said: 'Social media is something women didn't have ten years ago, and that's a big aspect in feminism today. I don't have to be filtered by anyone. I choose.'\n\nExhibitionism is not Emily's only motive; the swimwear she so frequently models is from her own line.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 17], "id": "Q5372335", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q5372335"]}, {"span": [83, 88], "id": "<NIL>", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": []}, {"span": [134, 151], "id": "Q5372335", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q5372335"]}, {"span": [375, 388], "id": "<NIL>", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q12207092", "Q13722936", "Q65084975"]}, {"span": [470, 479], "id": "Q209330", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q104868291", "Q209330", "Q3356118", "Q63865557", "Q65682397"]}, {"span": [560, 570], "id": "Q5669", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q151047", "Q3696579", "Q4949016", "Q4949017", "Q5669", "Q6828740", "Q840353"]}, {"span": [683, 690], "id": "Q38", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1056744", "Q1125341", "Q1404472", "Q15804", "Q162333", "Q172579", "Q192786", "Q1992919", "Q2023750", "Q2254415", "Q2257191", "Q2257793", "Q3149102", "Q3679098", "Q38", "Q48742118", "Q50001", "Q56446973", "Q6093340", "Q652", "Q669701", "Q676899", "Q74217", "Q838931", "Q855186", "Q903165", "Q929124", "Q938616", "Q948174", "Q974693"]}, {"span": [707, 721], "id": "Q151047", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1212861", "Q1283024", "Q151047"]}, {"span": [938, 948], "id": "Q237875", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q237875"]}, {"span": [952, 967], "id": "Q654606", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q654606"]}, {"span": [1051, 1056], "id": "Q5372335", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1153186", "Q1337584", "Q204672", "Q22004223", "Q2230773", "Q3588823", "Q4441", "Q446008", "Q51278422", "Q5371651", "Q5372018", "Q5372020", "Q5372024", "Q5372026", "Q5372027", "Q5372063", "Q5372132", "Q5372150", "Q5372163", "Q5372204", "Q5372252", "Q5372330", "Q5372335", "Q6738326", "Q696220", "Q80137", "Q8336615", "Q8348434", "Q901527", "Q989354"]}, {"span": [1290, 1298], "id": "Q1170076", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1019486", "Q1170076", "Q182658", "Q1932057", "Q206", "Q2546810", "Q262980", "Q2666657", "Q26689584", "Q3127693", "Q3127695", "Q3127696", "Q3127703", "Q322807", "Q3709583", "Q377171", "Q4354689", "Q46148445", "Q463536", "Q485001", "Q5663342", "Q5663346", "Q5663435", "Q5790909", "Q591915", "Q654606", "Q7345271", "Q853499", "Q95149", "Q982154"]}, {"span": [1339, 1344], "id": "Q5372335", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1153186", "Q1337584", "Q204672", "Q22004223", "Q2230773", "Q3588823", "Q4441", "Q446008", "Q51278422", "Q5371651", "Q5372018", "Q5372020", "Q5372024", "Q5372026", "Q5372027", "Q5372063", "Q5372132", "Q5372150", "Q5372163", "Q5372204", "Q5372252", "Q5372330", "Q5372335", "Q6738326", "Q696220", "Q80137", "Q8336615", "Q8348434", "Q901527", "Q989354"]}, {"span": [1611, 1616], "id": "Q5372335", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1153186", "Q1337584", "Q204672", "Q22004223", "Q2230773", "Q3588823", "Q4441", "Q446008", "Q51278422", "Q5371651", "Q5372018", "Q5372020", "Q5372024", "Q5372026", "Q5372027", "Q5372063", "Q5372132", "Q5372150", "Q5372163", "Q5372204", "Q5372252", "Q5372330", "Q5372335", "Q6738326", "Q696220", "Q80137", "Q8336615", "Q8348434", "Q901527", "Q989354"]}], "evaluation_span": [832, 1285], "labels": [{"id": 1, "span": [836, 843], "entity_id": "Q33999", "name": "actor", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871", "coref": false}, {"id": 3, "span": [938, 948], "entity_id": "Q237875", "name": "Naomi Wolf", "type": "Q215627", "coref": false}, {"id": 4, "span": [952, 967], "entity_id": "Q654606", "name": "Harper's Bazaar", "type": "Q17537576|Q2424752", "coref": false}, {"id": 5, "span": [971, 975], "entity_id": "DATETIME", "name": "Unknown", "type": "DATETIME", "coref": false}, {"id": 6, "span": [981, 987], "entity_id": "Q12068677", "name": "selfie", "type": "Q483394", "coref": false}, {"id": 7, "span": [1051, 1056], "entity_id": "Q5372335", "name": "Emily Ratajkowski", "type": "Q215627", "coref": false}, {"id": 10, "span": [1164, 1170], "entity_id": "Q12068677", "name": "selfie", "type": "Q483394", "coref": false}]}
{"id": 20174883997, "title": "20171227 - JustGiving waived fee on Claire Squires' page but does it really need to take 8% from a \u00a310 donation?", "text": "JustGiving waived fee on Claire Squires' page but does it really need to take 8% from a \u00a310 donation?\n\nBy Andrew Oxlade for the Daily Mail\n\n\nWhen the huge public reaction to the death of marathon runner Claire Squires became apparent, the reaction from JustGiving, which hosted her fundraising, should have been automatic: it should waive the substantial fee that it creams off donations.\n\nBut it was only late last Tuesday morning that the \"for-profit\" company said the charge would not be applied - after an email from us and the start of a backlash on their own homepage blog, which was urging people to donate.\n\nThis evening, Claire's fundraising total had hit \u00a3910,000, or \u00a31.1million including the gift aid top-up from taxpayers.\n\nJustGiving says it charges 5 per cent but this is applied after gift aid so the \u00a355,000 it would have made works out as more than 6 per cent of public donations. On top of this, there's a 1.3 per cent credit card charge.\n\nConsider if you donated \u00a310 by credit card. The amount is topped up to \u00a312.50 because of gift aid. The 5 per cent fee is applied - 63p - then 1.3 per cent credit card charge on the \u00a310 - 13p - taking the total to 76p.\n\nThis means fees account for 7.6 per cent of the original \u00a310 donation\n\nSome of the people I've spoken to this week, on social media and in person, don't realise there is a fee at all.\n\nIt's hardly surprising. There's no mention of it on the homepage and only a small reference way down at the foot of each giving page, which most donors are unlikely to see.\n\nJustGiving pioneered this method of online giving a decade ago but now it's the supine encumbent, surpassed by far cheaper rivals, such as Virginmoneygiving.com, Bmycharity.com and Charitygiving.co.uk.\n\nVirgin Money, which is not-for-profit, only charges 2 per cent on donations and not on gift aid, and Bmycharity.com applies no commission, just a flat charge on card payments.\n\nThey also charge the charities a lower fee than JustGiving just to register to accept donations. [Read the story on Justgiving and its cheaper rivals].\n\nIt's big business for JustGiving. Consider that the London Marathon raises more than \u00a350million a year. JustGiving will account for a large chunk of that each year - and take 5 per cent.\n\nJustGiving claims its revenues help to hone the process of giving and help it make more money for charities. It claims to have raised \u00a3770million since 2000, which should mean earnings of \u00a338.5million for the company. It insists \u00a314million has been 're-invested in technology alone'.\n\nPresumably after the staff are paid - there's 72 of them - there's potential for decent profits.\n\nTo be fair, innovation should be encouraged and rewarded when it contributes to the common good.\n\nBut for the sake of transparency the company should declare its cut of each donation during the actual payment process and publish its annual profits on the website.

{"id": 2018915691, "title": "20180105 - Taylor Swift's new song disses famous ex-boyfriends", "text": "Taylor Swift's new song disses famous ex-boyfriends\n\nShe's already lashed out at the likes of Katy Perry, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West on the first revenge-themed track from her new album.\n\nBut it appears absolutely nobody is safe from Taylor Swift's razor-sharp lyrics, as she seems to take aim at her impressive roster of famous ex-boyfriends in her new song Ready For It?\n\nThe sassy songstress uses the peppy new love anthem to lavish current boyfriend Joe Alwyn with praise, while not-so-subtly appearing to diss former lovers such as Tom Hiddleston and Calvin Harris.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nTaylor, 27, has released the second track from new album, reputation, and sleuthing fans have already started decoding the lyrics to work out just who Taylor is singing about.\n\nHer lyrics include: 'Knew he was a killer, first time that I saw him, wonder how many girls he had left haunted.'\n\nShe goes on: 'Some boys are tryin' too hard. He don't try at all though. Younger than my exes but he act like such a man so I see nothing better, I keep him forever.'\n\nFans immediately assumed Taylor was singing about actor boyfriend Joe, 26, who is younger than previous loves Tom, 36, and Calvin, 33, and made his movie debut as a solider in the 2016 film Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk.\n\nThe superstar then seems to allude to her past doomed romances with Tom, Calvin and the likes of Harry Styles, 23 and Jake Gyllenhaal, 26, by purring: 'Every love I've known in comparison is a failure, I forget their names now. I'm so very tame now. Never be the same now.'\n\nMeanwhile, others have asked if Taylor is poking fun at her serial dater reputation with the lyrics: 'Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me, stealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry.'\n\nTo an ebullient tune, the chorus blares that 'In the middle of the night, in my dreams, you should see the things we do, baby. In the middle of the night, in my dreams, I know I'm gonna be with you.'\n\nTaylor has been quietly dating Joe since last year, choosing to keep their romance away from the limelight, which means if Ready For It? was penned about Joe, it's the first time she's publicly acknowledged the relationship.\n\nSome fans have wondered whether the song title, Ready For It?, is directed at Joe, asking if he's ready for the attention that comes with dating the pop princess.\n\nThe song was released amid claims Taylor has filed paperwork to trademark phrases and lyrics connected with her new reputation album, including the line from Look What You Made Me Do, 'The old Taylor can't come to the phone right now. Why? Because she's dead.'\n\nAccording to TMZ, the award-winning singer-songwriter has also trademarked song titles from her reputation album so she can use the lyrics and titles on official merchandise.\n\nMeanwhile, a minute-long snippet of Ready For It? debuted during the Alabama versus Florida State football game on Saturday, before Taylor released the entire track to YouTube on Sunday.\n\nIn stark contrast to Look What You Made Me Do, the peppy new anthem struck a far more upbeat note, with Taylor singing of love and romance.\n\nBoth Taylor and ESPN shared a clip of the track with fans on social media, which was the background music for scenes of the two football teams prepared to hit the field.\n\nThe video featured scenes of cheerleaders, fans, football players, and seemed to herald a major shift from Look What You Made Me Do.\n\n'Are you ready for it?' Taylor sings in the pop country song. 'Baby let the games begin.'\n\nTwitter was ablaze with fan reaction, including YouTube personality Raphael Gomes, who wrote: 'oh my good i am shooketh, #readyforit sounds like red meets 1989 meets look what you made me do, it sounds magical'.\n\nAnother fan wrote a tweet in which his response to the song snippet was a GIF of Jim Parsons' The Big Bang Theory character Sheldon hyperventilating into a paper bag.\n\nAs some eagle-eyed fans noticed, Taylor had hinted at this single on August 24, in an Instagram post promoting Look What You Made Me Do.\n\nShe'd written: '...ready for it? New single #LookWhatYouMadeMeDo out now. Pre-order #reputation (link in bio) and find out about tickets and merch at taylorswift.com'.\n\nThe whole song will be the opener on reputation, according toPeople.\n\nDespite the fact Look What You Made Me Do proclaimed the 'old Taylor' was 'dead,' Ready For It? appears to be a return to form - a country-tinged, peppy love song.\n\nLook What You Made Me Do, on the other hand, had been a score-settling number aimed at those 'I don't like.'\n\nShe lashed out at betrayals: 'You asked me for a place to sleep, / Locked me out, and threw a feast,' and appeared to dredge up her on-off feud with Kanye West in the line: 'I don't like your tilted stage,' Kanye having performed on tilted stages on tour.\n\nThe lyrics insisted that 'I got smarter. I got harder in the nick of time,' and that 'Honey, I rose up from the dead. I do it all the time.'\n\nShe warned: 'I've got a list of names, and yours is in red underlined.'\n\nWhen that song's music video debuted at Sunday's MTV Video Music Awards, fans were treated to a smorgasbord of references to her old beefs.\n\nAt one point, she looks strikingly like Katy Perry while crashing a car and emerging from the wreck brandishing a Grammy Award.\n\nKaty's infamously a 13-time Grammy nominee and a zero-time winner, whilst Taylor's won a grand total of 10 Grammy Awards herself.\n\nIn the most scathing dig of the video, she lounges in a bathtub full of jewelry, possibly in reference to Kim Kardashian's robbery last October in Paris.\n\nThe robbers had bound her at gunpoint and flung her into the bathtub of her suite at the H\u00f4tel de Pourtal\u00e8s, making off with millions of dollars worth of her jewelry.\n\nAt one point, whilst sitting in the bathtub in the music video, Taylor even mimes firing off a gun.\n\nKim had involved herself in Taylor's feud with Kanye last year, after which Taylor accused the couple of 'character assassination,' so it's interesting that the bathtub bit of the music video sees Taylor gripe about 'How you laugh when you lie.'\n\nOld flames get a going over too, including Tom Hiddleston, who was notoriously photographed during their relationship in a tank top reading: 'I [heart] T.S.'\n\nTaylor appears in the video with male backup dancers wearing stilettos, hose and crop tops that have got that same inscription.\n\nBy the end of the video, there's a row of Taylors - each dressed to represent a different one of her past personae - and they all begin sniping at one another.\n\nOne, for example, is the gawky Taylor of the You Belong With Me video, and another's wearing the gown she wore to the 2009 VMAs, at which Kanye had interrupted her acceptance speech to shower praise on Beyonce.\n\nThe dorky, perpetually thrilled You Belong With Me Taylor is hectored by one of the others: 'You can't possibly be that surprised all the time.'\n\nWhen VMA Taylor expresses a desire 'to be excluded from this narrative' - a phrase she'd used last summer vis-\u00e0-vis the Kimye feud - all the others scream: 'SHUT UP!'\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 12], "id": "Q26876", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q26876", "Q842214", "Q845783"]}, {"span": [94, 104],

He ran on the weekend, so he will train as well.\n\n\"There will be some good inclusions on the track from guys who missed last week, so that's all positive news.\"\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span":

Kasem began that show in 1970 and hosted it and variations of it until finally ending his radio career in 2009.\n\nBut for more than just those encouraging words, Kasem will be remembered for helping to elevate the radio disc jockey gig to one of storyteller and observer of the human condition.\n\nFans would write in to his show for \"long-distance dedications\" -- requesting a song for a loved one, a friend or a personal connection far away. In his smooth baritone voice, Kasem would begin \"Dear Casey\" and proceed to tell tales that ranged from heartbreaking to inspirational.\n\nThe dedications poured in from around the world. In 1986, Kasem read a dedication request from a woman in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, who wanted to honor her sister who -- despite suffering paralysis -- was studying for her master's degree in the United States.\n\n\"I'm so proud of her, not only for her achievements, but proud of her will and toughness and of her stubborn determination to pick up the pieces and start all over again when most of us would break down and quit,\" Kasem read. \"Casey, could you kindly play 'Broken Wings' for my sister Ayesha at Oklahoma State University? I do hope she's listening, for this is a message from those who love her, all the way from home here in Malaysia.\"\n\nKasem got personal after the death of Beatle John Lennon. The DJ offered up moving words in 1980 after Lennon was gunned down near his New York City apartment by Mark David Chapman.\n\n\"But John died having discovered who he was,\" Kasem said. \"John Lennon, husband to Yoko, father to Sean [Lennon's young son with wife Yoko Ono].\"\n\nThe role of music orator was one Kasem took very seriously.\n\n\"It's so simple: what do people love?\" Kasem said to the New York Times in a 1999 article. \"Plato said it best. 'People who tell the stories rule society.' And we tell the stories, and people love to hear the stories. Of course, we've got tremendous responsibility to become accurate with those stories. And in most cases to be wholesome.\"\n\nOn Sunday, the \"AT40\" website posted a tribute to Kasem. The site for the program, now hosted by Ryan Seacrest, included audio clips of Kasem on the show throughout the years.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 11], "id": "Q1047230", "recognized_by":

In Cameron's case, losing another vote on Syria could trigger a leadership challenge against him, something that a significant minority in his fractious party would welcome.\n\nMany politicians and commentators have also expressed fears that Cameron's defeat could damage Britain's 'special relationship' with the United States given that President Barack Obama had asked for and not got British military support.\n\nHowever, another poll showed most Britons did not share that fear. The survey, by the BBC, showed that 72 percent of those asked did not think UK-U.S. ties would be harmed, and two thirds of respondents would not care if they were.\n\n(Reporting By Andrew Osborn;

{"id": 20173573669, "title": "20170926 - Piers Morgan: JK Rowling's Trump slur proves her hypocrisy", "text": "Piers Morgan: JK Rowling's Trump slur proves her hypocrisy\n\nJK Rowling hates Donald Trump.\n\nI don't just mean she dislikes him intensely, I mean she loathes him with a raw, visceral fury.\n\nThe billionaire Harry Potter author broadcasts this fact on a daily basis to her 11 million followers on Twitter.\n\nBarely an hour goes by without Ms Rowling publicly attacking, mocking, sneering at and generally abusing Trump.\n\nOf course, that is entirely her prerogative and she is far from alone in this regard.\n\nA lot of people, including many left-wing celebrities like her, feel the exact same way about the 45th President of the United States.\n\nPolitics is a passionate business. It inflames people.\n\nAnd no politician in the history of Planet Earth inflames people quite as much as Donald J. Trump.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nOn Friday, a video was posted on Twitter by Ansel Herz, deputy communications director for Democrat Rep. Pramila Jayapal.\n\nIt showed Trump appearing to avoid shaking hands with a disabled child before leaving a White House function.\n\n\"Child in wheelchair reaches up twice to shake the president's hand,\" was Herz's simple but devastating caption.\n\n\"If you're disgusted by this,\" he added, \"follow my boss: @RepJayapal. People call her \"the anti-Trump.\" \"\n\nDisgust duly followed.\n\nThe short video clip went viral within minutes, sparking horror and rage around the world.\n\nShare this article\n\nShare\n\n4.4k shares\n\nKeith Olbermann, infamous left-wing political commentator who now hosts a Trump-bashing GQ webshow \"The Resistance,\" led the charge, re-tweeting Herz's video clip with the words: \"About Trump, this is mortifying, revelatory. OTOH, I'm somebody who shook his damnable hand. The child is fortunate he didn't touch the evil.\"\n\nFor JK Rowling, this was the moment she had long been waiting for.\n\nHere, right before our very eyes, was actual visible proof that Trump really is a barbaric, callous monster as she keeps saying.\n\nShe hit her laptop faster than Usain Bolt hits his stride.\n\nFirst, Rowling retweeted Herz's tweet alongside a quote she had located from legendary civil rights activist Maya Angelou that read: \"When someone shows you who they are, believe them.\"\n\nIn other words, THIS was the real Donald Trump: a merciless man who would deliberately ignore a young disabled child reaching up to shake his hand.\n\nSeconds later, she tweeted again: \"Trump imitated a disabled reporter. Now he pretends not to see a child in a wheelchair, as though frightened he may catch his condition.\"\n\nWow.\n\nNo room for ambiguity there.\n\nRowling was very clear: Trump knew the disabled child was there and snubbed him because he was worried about being infected with whatever disease the boy may have.\n\nTweets No3 and No4 came together, fast and furious: \"This monster of narcissism values only himself and his pale reflections. The disabled, minorities, transgender people, the poor, women... (unless related to him by ties of blood, and therefore his creations) are treated with contempt, because they do not resemble Trump.\"\n\nThen, in tweet No5, Rowling got personal, invoking the spirit of her mother who died in 1990.\n\n\"My mother used a wheelchair. I witnessed people uncomfortable around her disability, but if they had a shred of decency they got over it.\"\n\nTweet No6 explained this was why Rowling felt SO enraged: \"So, yes, that clip of Trump looking deliberately over a disabled child's head, ignoring his outstretched hand, has touched me on the raw.\"\n\nAgain, she left no room for any doubt. Trump hadn't accidentally snubbed the boy, he had done it \"deliberately.\"\n\nTweet No7 clarified why this was so vile: \"That man occupies the most powerful office in the free world and his daily outrages against civilised norms are having a corrosive effect.\"\n\nAnd then, in Tweet No8, JK Rowling reached peak anger: \"How stunning,\" she wrote, \"and how horrible, that Trump cannot bring himself to shake the hand of a small boy who only wanted to touch the President.\"\n\nBy this stage, it would be hard not to share Rowling's uncontrollable rage - right? I suspect most of her 11.4 million Twitter followers would certainly have felt that way.\n\nThey trust Rowling.\n\nAs she never ceases to remind us from her high moral plinth, she is the very beacon of honesty, decency and fairness in a world increasingly blighted by Trump-related lies, indecency and unfairness.\n\nShe, like Rep. Jayapal, is the \"anti-Trump.\"\n\nShe is someone who would never snub a disabled boy.\n\nThere's just one problem: it was all a lie.\n\nTrump didn't snub the boy. In fact he did the complete opposite.\n\nThe full video of this incident emerged several hours after Rowling tweeted.\n\nIt shows Trump heading directly to the boy the moment he entered the room.\n\nHe greets him before he greets anyone else.\n\nThen the President crouches down, touches the boy and talks just to him for a few more seconds before moving on.\n\nIt turns out that Trump spent more time with the boy in the wheelchair than any other guest - displaying all the compassion and empathy he had been accused of failing to display.\n\nBy the time this longer video appeared, the original edited clip was everywhere, gleefully fuelled by high profile liberals.\n\nChelsea Clinton, who has 1.8 million followers, seized on Rowling's tweets, re-tweeting both the Maya Angelou quote and clip, and the one about how \"stunning and horrible\" it was that Trump snubbed the boy.\n\nAs Sir Winston Churchill once said: \"A lie gets halfway round the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on.\"\n\nAnsel Herz, once he saw the full video, immediately removed his tweets.\n\n\"Deleted because it turned out to missing some context,\" he said. \"Apologies.\"\n\nMissing some context? You can say that again, buddy.\n\nLet's be very clear: you made the whole world think Trump hates disabled kids.\n\nNow, at this point, some five hours after her vicious tweet-storm, JK Rowling started to be bombarded with demands to delete her own tweets and apologise. I tweeted her myself to say: \"What's stunning and horrible is how you lied to viciously smear Trump. Delete these lies.\"\n\nShe didn't respond, to anybody.\n\nThe world's most aggressively self-righteous tweeter went unusually silent.\n\nA whole day went by.\n\nThen another.\n\nFinally, more than 48 hours later, Rowling came back on Twitter yesterday.\n\nBut not, it transpired, to delete the tweets that she now knew were 100% wrong.\n\nNo, instead she wished to rant about some deeply offensive comments made by an Irish newspaper columnist.\n\n\"This filth was published in the Sunday Times,\" she seethed. \"Let that sink in for a moment.\"\n\nI didn't have much time to let it sink in before the newspaper concerned deleted the column, profusely apologised and fired the journalist who wrote it.\n\nYet, incredibly, indignant Rowling saw no inconsistency in allowing her own deeply offensive tweets about Trump and the disabled boy to remain on her feed.\n\nEven the boy's mother pleaded with her to remove the tweets.\n\n\"Ummm,\" said Marjorie Kelly Weer in a Facebook post, \"if someone can please get a message to JK Rowling. Trump didn't snub my son & Monty wasn't even trying to shake his hand (1. He's 3 and hand shaking is not his thing. 2. He was showing off his newly acquired secret service patch). Thanks.\"\n\nBut this too fell on deaf, or stubborn ears.\n\nLast December, in yet another rant about Trump, JK Rowling made her feelings crystal clear about people who don't apologise for getting things wrong.\n\nShe did so by tweeting this quote from the 17th century French writer Francois de la Rochefoucauld: \"No people are more frequently wrong than those who will not admit they are wrong.\"\n\nIt has now been three days since JK Rowling posted a pack of lies about Donald Trump to her 11 million followers.\n\nShe knows it was wrong. We all know it was wrong.\n\nYet, as I write, she still refuses to delete the tweets, correct her lies, or apologise.\n\nEven if she does so now, perhaps after reading this column, the damage has been done.\n\nBy contrast, everyone else I have mentioned did remove their tweets once they realised the truth.\n\nHerz deleted, Olbermann deleted and Chelsea Clinton, when I brought it to her attention yesterday, also deleted.\n\nRowling, however, would prefer to continue using a three-year-old disabled boy to falsely smear Donald Trump, such is her blind hatred for the man.\n\nBy doing so, she is telling her millions of young impressionable Potter fans that it's absolutely fine to lie and never correct or apologise for a lie - after spending the past two years telling them that Trump is disgusting because he lies and never corrects or apologises for his lies.\n\nThis makes her a shameful, disgraceful hypocrite.\n\nNobody should believe a word this self-appointed High Priestess of Honesty ever says again, about anything.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 12], "id": "Q557758", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q557758"]}, {"span": [14, 24],

{"id": 2011507124, "title": "20110302 - The Center for Radiation Therapy of Beverly Hills Earns ACR-ASTRO Accreditation", "text": "The Center for Radiation Therapy of Beverly Hills Earns ACR-ASTRO Accreditation\n\nBEVERLY HILLS, Calif., March 2, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- The Center for Radiation Therapy of Beverly Hills, a state-of-the-art cancer treatment center serving cancer patients in the Los Angeles area, has been awarded a three-year term of accreditation in radiation oncology as the result of a recent review by the American College of Radiology (ACR) and The American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO).\n\nRadiation oncology (radiation therapy) is the careful use of high-energy radiation to treat cancer. A radiation oncologist may use radiation to cure cancer or to relieve a cancer patient's pain.\n\nThe ACR-ASTRO seal of accreditation represents the highest level of quality and patient safety. It is awarded only to facilities meeting specific practice guidelines and technical standards developed by ACR and ASTRO after a peer-review evaluation by board-certified radiation oncologists and medical physicists who are experts in the field.\n\nPatient care and treatment, patient safety, personnel qualifications, adequacy of facility equipment, quality control procedures, and quality assurance programs are assessed in the review process. The findings are reported to the ACR-ASTRO Committee on Radiation Oncology Accreditation, which subsequently provides the practice with a comprehensive report it can use for continuous practice improvement.\n\nThe Center for Radiation Therapy of Beverly Hills, part of the Tower Hematology Oncology Medical Group, voluntarily underwent the rigorous review process to ensure the practice meets nationally accepted standards of care as determined by ACR. It is the first free-standing radiation center in California, and only the second radiation facility of any kind in the Los Angeles area, to earn the accreditation.\n\n\"We are honored to receive this prestigious accreditation, which acknowledges that the center's medical personnel are well qualified, through education and certification, to administer radiation therapy treatments,\" said Christopher M. Rose, M.D., Medical Director of The Center for Radiation Therapy of Beverly Hills and Chief Technology Officer of Valley Radiotherapy Associates. \"We look forward to continuing to offer patients the most effective and up-to-date treatment options, and providing care that meets the highest quality standards.\"\n\nBarry Rosenbloom, M.D., Managing Partner of the Tower Hematology Oncology Medical Group, said the accreditation reflects the entire group's commitment to safety and unsurpassed patient care.\n\n\"Earning the ACR-ASTRO accreditation ensures our patients that they will receive appropriate treatment from skilled medical professionals using superbly maintained equipment, in a facility that meets the most demanding professional benchmarks for safety and quality assurance,\" Dr. Rosenbloom asserted.\n\nThe ACR is a national professional organization serving more than 34,000 diagnostic and interventional radiologists, radiation oncologists, nuclear medicine physicians, and medical physicists, with programs focusing on the practice of medical imaging and radiation oncology and the delivery of comprehensive health care services. ASTRO is a professional organization serving more than 10,000 radiation oncologists, medical physicists, and other health care professionals involved in the treatment of cancer patients.\n\nAbout The Center for Radiation Therapy of Beverly Hills\n\nEstablished in 2006 by Tower Hematology Oncology Medical Group, The Center for Radiation Therapy of Beverly Hills (RTBH) is centrally located in the heart of Beverly Hills and adjacent to the cities of Santa Monica and Los Angeles. RTBH provides oncology patients with state-of-the-art radiation therapy care by a team of highly trained and experienced clinicians.

make a mess and teaches kids a life skill.\n\nHasbro has unveiled a robotic dog called Proto Max that educates kids on the basics of coding by letting them program its personality.\n\nThere are also 10 activation points on the robo-dog's body, which kids assign reactions to and the app is equip with a remote control so users can drive it around.\n\n\nHasbro unveiled a $120 coding toy for children ages six and older.\n\nCalled Proto Max, kids use an app to customize its personality.\n\nIt comes in eight pieces out of the box and is programmed with 400 sounds and 100 eye animations.\n\nThere are three personalities to choose from - small, medium and big - and these options determine the dog's 'general temperament'.\n\nThe 10 different activation points trigger different behaviors that users can customize, the points include the ears, nose, tail and two sensors in the patch of fur on its back.\n\nThe robot dog was unveiled at the New York Toy Fair this weekend and is part of the FurReal Friends line, reports Cherlynn Low with Engadget.\n\nHasbro is offering the coding toy for $120, which is geared towards children ages six and older.\n\nProto Max is specifically designed to teach your youngster how to code and comes with a downloadable free app for both iOS and Android.\n\nIt can be assembled with just eight pieces and is programmed with 400 sounds and 100 eye animations.\n\nThe app lets kids change the robotic dog's behavior and character only - none of his features such as eye color of nose shape can be altered.\n\nThere are three personalities to choose from - small, medium and big - and these options determine the dog's 'general temperament', reports Engadget.\n\nShare this article\n\nShare\n\n71 shares\n\nAnd there is a dial on the side of its face that lets kids adjust the pitch of Proto Max's voice and how it reacts to stimuli.\n\nThe 10 different activation points trigger different behaviors that users can customize, the points include the ears, nose, tail and two sensors in the patch of fur on its back.\n\nKids can set the robot to respond to interactions by 'dragging and dropping reactions to slots on an in-app diagram of the robot,' reports Engadget.\n\nProto Max's housing is mostly transparent, as it allows kids to see the inner workings of the robot.\n\nIts eyes consist of 2.6-inch LCD screens and speakers are placed around the machine.\n\nAnd kids can play fun games with Max such as feeding the robot and playing fetch.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 6], "id": "Q501476", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by":

{"id": 2013620236, "title": "20130524 - G4S contract to run sexual assault referral centres damned", "text": "G4S contract to run sexual assault referral centres damned\n\nG4S Forensic and Medical Services already provides similar services in Essex, Worcester and Telford. Photograph: David Jones/PA\n\nG4S, the controversial private security company, is to run services providing medical examinations and counselling for victims of rape and sexual assault in the West Midlands.\n\nThe company has been awarded a three-year contract to take over two sexual assault referral centres (Sarcs) in Birmingham and Walsall. The national network of 33 centres across England which have developed over the past decade also allow rape and sexual assault victims to report attacks without going to the police first.\n\nThe decision to award the contract for such sensitive services to the company, despite widespread criticism over its failings in the Olympics security contract, was made by local NHS commissioners who have recently taken over responsibility for the network of Sarcs from the police.\n\nUnion leaders and violence against women campaigners sharply criticised the \"sell-off\" of such sensitive services to a private company with such a chequered record.\n\nKaren Jennings, Unison's assistant general secretary, said: \"It is shocking that a private, profit-making company with such a chequered record should be put in charge of these highly sensitive and intimate support services. A woman at her most vulnerable must be treated with the ultimate respect, dignity and sensitivity by trained professionals who she feels confident about placing her trust in,\" she said.\n\n\"The police service has developed over the years experience and expertise in working with women at such difficult times. They have well-established links with supportive services and agencies and that progress should not be undermined by selling these services off.\"\n\nRape Crisis (England and Wales) said victims of sexual violence need to access long-term support and counselling as well as immediate medical and legal help: \"Our concern is that commissioning generic private contractors such as G4S to run Sarcs will lead to a focus on cost-efficiency above the needs of sexual violence victims and, in particular, that crucial long-term support services will be sacrificed in the name of cost-cutting.\"\n\nThe decision to give G4S the contract appears to follow complaints that the existing centre in the West Midlands had failed to meet official minimum standards for at least four years.\n\nG4S Forensic and Medical Services is already involved in providing similar services in Essex, Worcester and Telford. Women \"crisis workers\" staff the centres, assist with medical assessment and provide advice on follow-up services. G4S also provides women-only call handlers for dedicated phone lines for victims who contact Sarcs in Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire, Wiltshire and Hertfordshire. It also provides a specialist service for child victims of sexual abuse in Devon.\n\nThe company has recently advertised for \"female crisis workers\" to work at Sarcs at \u00a312.50 an hour and to be on call on a 24/7 rota.\n\nIn response to the criticism, Gary Green, managing director of G4S Forensic and Medical Services, said it has been working in this area since 2005 and had developed substantial expertise in providing a high standard of care while helping the police protect the evidence they need to secure a conviction: \"Our dedicated medical staff come from a range of backgrounds in health and social care and are absolutely committed to looking after the needs of the victim at what can be a very traumatic time. That's why we work with the local health services and the police to ensure that in the centres we manage, we have specially trained advocates focused solely on the welfare of those who come forward to report rape or sexual assault.\"\n\nAt the launch of the West Midlands G4S contracts earlier this week, Chief Superintendent Simon Hyde, the West Midlands police's head of public protection, said: \"Research and evidence stresses how important it is for victims to be able to access skilled, experienced forensic medical practitioners as part of the service, and that a high ratio of these physicians should be female.\n\n\"We wanted to bring the focus back on the service we provide to victims and have ensured that we have consulted with our partners and voluntary agencies to ensure the facilities provided through the NHS give the highest standards of victim care and treatment.\"\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 3], "id": "Q1322045", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by":

{"id": 2018172890, "title": "20181213 - Did Your Favorite Flicks Make the 2018 National Film Registry List?", "text": "Did Your Favorite Flicks Make the 2018 National Film Registry List?\n\nThe 2018 inductees into the National Film Registry represent microcosms of American history and not necessarily the best films in cinematic history. Each year the Library of Congress adds 25 more films that must be at least 10 years old, in order to \"safeguard\" American-made films.\n\nNational Public Radio reported Wednesday that the announced selections should mirror American culture as \"compositions of consequence.\"\n\nDiverse genres, length and style of film comprise the 25 the Library of Congress selected, such as Jurassic Park (1993), Disney's 1950 classic Cinderella, Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain (2005), the Rex Harrison-Audrey Hepburn musical My Fair Lady (1964), Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca (1940), Field of Dreams (1989), the Generation X favorite The Goonies (1985) and The Shining (1980), the Stanley Kubrick horror flick starring Jack Nicholson.\n\nLibrarian of Congress Carla Hayden said: \"These cinematic treasures must be protected because they document our history, culture, hopes and dreams.\"\n\nSelection criteria for the registry focus on \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\" films. Historically, the National Film Registry includes American company-produced films, \"typically for theatrical release or recognized as a film through film festivals or film awards,\" reads the Library of Congress website. The purpose is to \"safeguard\" U.S. films.\n\nThe registry originated in 1989, when some of the first films chosen included undeniably classic The Wizard of Oz (1939), Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958), Singing in the Rain (1952), On the Waterfront with Marlon Brando (1954), Star Wars (1977) and a slew of Academy Award winning movies.\n\nThe new crop boasts a broader selection, including a short film, Hair Piece: A Film for Nappy Headed People (1984) and Smoke Signals (1998), the first-ever Native American-written, directed, co-produced and acted movie.\n\nIn a democratic show of hands, the Library of Congress gleans ongoing nominations from the public. To glimpse a list of suggested movies - listed by year - that you may want to nominate for next year's list, the library posts an online nomination form.\n\n\"Please do vote,\" reads the page. \"Films that receive the most support each year are given special consideration during the process by members of the National Film Preservation Board.\"\n\nThat means that films released in 2009 are now eligible for consideration, ranging back to 1890. If you have a special fondness for Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel, Angels and Demons, Fantastic Mr. Fox, Julie and Julia, The Hangover, Monsters vs. Aliens or any preceding year's film, now is your chance to vote - up to 50 times per year.\n\nHere's the full list of the 2018 additions:\n\nBad Day at Black Rock (1955)\n\nBroadcast News (1987)\n\nBrokeback Mountain (2005)\n\nCinderella (1950)\n\nDays of Wine and Roses (1962)\n\nDixon-Wanamaker Expedition to Crow Agency (1908)\n\nEve's Bayou (1997)\n\nThe Girl Without a Soul (1917)\n\nHair Piece: A Film for Nappy-Headed People (1984)\n\nHearts and Minds (1974)\n\nHud (1963)\n\nThe Informer (1935)\n\nJurassic Park (1993)\n\nThe Lady From Shanghai (1947)\n\nLeave Her to Heaven (1945)\n\nMonterey Pop (1968)\n\nMy Fair Lady (1964)\n\nThe Navigator (1924)\n\nOn the Town (1949)\n\nOne-Eyed Jacks (1961)\n\nPickup on South Street (1953)\n\nRebecca (1940)\n\nThe Shining (1980)\n\nSmoke Signals (1998)\n\nSomething Good - Negro

{"id": 20171640236, "title": "20170418 - Inside the lavish lifestyle of lotto winner scammer Baron", "text": "Inside the lavish lifestyle of lotto winner scammer Baron\n\nFrom slugging packages to people's doorsteps to cruising in a $200,000 BMW convertible, 'lotto rat' Gary Baron appears to have had no problem adjusting a life of luxury after winning a $16.6 million group Powerball.\n\nWhile his colleagues and lotto syndicate members kept their day jobs, the 50-year-old former Victorian Toll courier splashed his newfound cash on a $600,000 home for himself and two more houses for his children, according to The Courier Mail.\n\nHe then went on to purchase the extravagant BMW convertible and a car for his kids, while entertaining the idea of a jet ski and new phones.\n\nMr Baron won $16.6 million in a $50 million Powerball in 2014, but claimed he had purchased the winning ticket with his own money - not funds from a workplace lotto syndicate at Toll's North Geelong depot he managed.\n\n14 of Mr Baron's co-workers and syndicate members sued him for their share of the money, claiming he used their funds to buy the ticket before taking off with the cash and not telling them.\n\nA settlement was reached on Wednesday between Mr Baron and the group, but it is unknown how much they will each be paid out.\n\nThe 50-year-old reportedly called in sick to work before resigning.\n\nIn the days following, Tattersalls revealed in a press release a Victorian man - reportedly Mr Baron - had won $16.6 million.\n\n'I'm still in disbelief ... I don't need that amount of money, it's too much for me,' the man told officials.\n\n'I'm going to share the prize money with my family. I'll make sure it doesn't change who I am but I'll definitely be able to live a better lifestyle, with a few more toys.\n\n'I love being out on the water so I'll buy myself a boat and a jet ski, and my kids have been wanting the new iPhone 6 so they can have that now and I might spoil them each with a new car,' the anonymous man said.\n\nMr Baron was in charge of collecting $20 from each syndicate member to purchase lottery tickets on behalf of the group, according to a writ filed last year.\n\nThere was an understanding any winnings would be split equally between all members.\n\nMembers of the Syndicate, who said they were friends with Baron, told A Current Affair they questioned him about his recent lavish purchases.\n\n'I said \"you haven't pulled off the Powerball and haven't told us or anything have ya?\" and he just goes \"nah, nah\" and he just laughed and walked away,' one of men in the syndicate said.\n\n'Winning Tatts lotto is like, everybody dreams of it, that it only happened to the lucky few once in a while, this was our shot, and it's gone - he took it away from us.'\n\nThe 14 syndicate members only learned the truth about Baron's newfound wealth after one of his Toll colleagues delivered him a congratulatory bottle of champagne from Tattslotto.\n\nThe civil trial ended on the same day it began in the Victorian Supreme Court on Wednesday. It was expected to carry on for five days.\n\n'Things have changed a bit,' Justice Kim Hargrave said after counsel for the group suing Mr Baron advised the court the case had been resolved.\n\nIt is understood each of the members wanted around $1 million in a pay-out but may get less than a quarter of that, according to A Current Affair.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [52, 57], "id": "<NIL>",

{"id": 2020669123, "title": "20200919 - Media celebrates Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's life, legacy", "text": "Media celebrates Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's life, legacy\n\nAcross television and streaming services, the life and legacy of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was already front and center Saturday, a day after her death at 87. A look at coverage and plans in her honor:\n\nLooking back on the film that spotlighted Ginsburg worldwide, and offered intimate insight for young people, one of the CNN executives who shepherded the 2018 release pointed to the justice's cultural relevance.\n\n\"We greenlit the film because of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's extraordinary legacy in equal rights and her stature within our national culture,\" Amy Entelis, executive vice president for talent and content development for CNN Worldwide, told The Associated Press in an email Saturday.\n\n\"We never expected the film to generate the reaction that it did. Many people were unfamiliar with her pre-judicial career as a lawyer for the ACLU and how she played such an essential role in securing equal rights, particularly for women, which meant all Americans benefited,\" she wrote. \"The stories of her personal struggle to become an attorney makes her singular contributions to the law that much more poignant. And her enduring marriage to Martin Ginsburg touched and moved audiences of all genders and generations.\"\n\nThis CNN Films documentary will be broadcast on CNN Saturday night at 10 p.m. ET, with encores Sunday at 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. Eastern. The film is also available via CNN on demand with cable and satellite subscriptions beginning Sunday, and for streaming via CNNgo platforms, also beginning Sunday until Sept. 26.\n\nThe documentary is also available for streaming on Hulu, Apple TV and for rent on Amazon Prime Video and in the iTunes store.\n\nTime magazine will feature Ginsburg on one of multiple special covers for an October double issue presenting the 2020 Time 100 list of the world's most influential people. It will include a special tribute to the justice, who was featured on the list in 2015.\n\nThe issues will be available on newsstands in the U.S. beginning Sept. 25.\n\nThe 2018 bio-drama focusing on Ginsburg's law school years and early legal career is available for purchase on Amazon Prime Video and in the iTunes store.\n\nFelicity Jones, who portrayed the young law student and fighter for justice, told the AP in an email Saturday that Ginsburg was a beacon.\n\n\"Ruth Bader Ginsburg gave us hope, a public figure who stood for integrity and justice - a responsibility she did not wear lightly,\" she wrote. \"She will be missed not only as a beacon of light in these difficult times but for her razor sharp wit and extraordinary humanity. She taught us all so much. I will miss her deeply.\"\n\nOther distribution plans for the movie were pending Saturday.\n\nTributes and re-broadcasts are trending on streaming services and the apps of major networks, with more to come.\n\nPlans for \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" beginning at 9 a.m. Eastern, include journalist Erin Moriarty looking back on the life and times of the judge. Rita Braver, who covered Ginsburg, will offer an appreciation. John Dickerson of \"60 Minutes\" will report on the political implications of her death and \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker will have a tribute at the end of the Sunday night broadcast.\n\nAt NBC, the news division and those of its other networks are already out with special reports. On MSNBC, a past profile, \"Justice Ginsburg,\" was re-broadcast as word of her death spread, with plans to show it again Saturday night. The NBC streaming service Peacock has available a 2020 National Constitution Center even t honoring Ginbsurg.\n\nThroughout Saturday, Fox News shows \"FOX & Friends,\" \"CAVUTO Live\" and \"America's News HQ\" will discuss the legacy and historic career of Ginsburg. Joining the live coverage will be Chris Scalia, a son of Ginsburg's close friend and colleague, late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [25, 44], "id": "Q11116",

Here's the joke these days right, a friend of mine says 'hey man how's your sex life?' and I'm like 'oh it's just f---ing perfect because HIV is such a great pickup line!\" he told the show's hosts.\n\nWhen asked whether he's still sexually active he replied: 'not anymore' and added that his sex life suffered instantly after his shocking health revelation.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span":

Pantone has declared Ultra Violet the shade of 2018, so expect to see it on make-up counters in everything from eyeliner to lipstick.\n\nIf that feels a step too far, try a violet nail polish. Nailberry's L'Oxygene Polish in Extravagant (\u00a314.50, nailberry.co.uk) ensures nails won't dry out, or for a deeper shade, try YSL La Laque Couture Nail Polish in Violet Baroque (\u00a319.50, yslbeauty.co.uk).\n\nI love L'Oreal Color Riche Oil Nail Polish in Violet Vendome (\u00a34.95, nailpolishdirect.co.uk), a rich, vibrant hue.\n\n\nAll eyes have been on Meghan Markle and her glowing skin since her engagement.\n\nSo it's nice to hear she loves a multi-tasking bargain just as much as the rest of us. Her must-have travel product is a bottle of Tea Tree Oil.\n\nA natural antiseptic, it can be used to heal blemishes, inhaled with steam to treat a cold and even as a hand sanitiser. Try Thursday Plantation Tea Tree Oil (\u00a39.99, Boots).\n\n\nIt's always tempting to relax in a long, hot bath - especially on a day like today. But it is not such good news for your complexion. Hot water strips the natural oils and moisture from your skin, leaving it parched, dry and even scaly. This can also lead to more wrinkles, as drier skin tends to crease more readily.\n\nTry to resist using water that is too hot, and limit baths or showers to 15 minutes tops. Most importantly, make sure you add a moisturising product to the water.\n\nBramley Bubble Bath (\u00a312, bramley products.co.uk) contains geranium and lavender, with sweet orange essential oils. It's gentle and gets to work hydrating the skin while you relax.\n\n\nIf you feel like your complexion needs extra help to counteract overindulgence and revive dull skin (who doesn't at this time of year) Chanel's new palette is your secret weapon.\n\nThe Palette Essentielle (\u00a352, chanel.com) contains a blush, a concealer and a highlighter in natural, complementary colours to hide blemishes and give cheeks a glow.\n\n\nIn your 50s: Perfect for brightening under the eyes, Rimmel Wake Me Up Concealer (\u00a36.49, Boots) can also be used on pigmentation. Pat over your foundation with the applicator and blend with your finger.\n\nIn your 60s: MUA Cover and Conceal Wand (\u00a31.50, Superdrug) should be used before applying foundation for long-lasting coverage. It works particularly well on thread veins or dark under-eye shadows.\n\nIn your 70s: Available in 12 shades, NYX Studio Photogenic Wand Concealer (\u00a36, Debenhams) works for most skin tones. It brightens and camouflages and even comes in a green shade to neutralise redness.\n\n\nJanuary is when our immune systems most need a boost to ward off coughs and colds.\n\nEchinacea has been shown to aid the body's defence against germs and now - thanks to Fresh cosmetics - the immune boosting plant extract can benefit our skin, too.\n\nThe Fresh Creme Ancienne Ultimate Nourishing Honey Mask (\u00a3116 John Lewis) uses echinacea to detoxify, and pure honey to help seal in moisture, soften skin and improve elasticity.\n\nApply to dampened face, leave on for 10 minutes, then rinse as normal. It feels very rich, but not sticky. A pricey, but worth it, New Year treat.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [98, 102], "id": "Q297410", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q297410", "Q4745162",

But the famously discreet Duchess of Cambridge may have dropped her guard a little on a walkabout.\n\nAccording to one member of the crowd, Kate, who is five months pregnant, appeared to hint she might be having a baby girl.\n\nSandra Cook 67, was among the 2,000 wellwishers who greeted the Duchess on her visit to Grimsby.\n\n\"The lady next to me gave her a teddy bear and I distinctly heard her say 'Thank you, I will take that for my d....',\" she told the Daily Mail.\n\n\"Then she stopped herself. I leant over and said to her: 'You were going to say daughter, weren't you?' She said: \"No, we don't know!\" I said: 'Oh, I think you do' to which she replied: \"We're not telling!\"\n\n\"I have been here since 10am and it was worth every cold minute of the wait to see her. She is just beautiful and so lovely and friendly.\"\n\nDiana Burton, 41, who gave Kate the teddy, was too shell-shocked to recall the conversation.But Mrs Cook, who works in a local charity shop and lives in Grimsby, was adamant about what she heard.\n\nCatherine, Duchess of Cambridge, took a teddy bear from a well-wisher and allegedly said \"Thank you, I will take that for my d....'.\" (Photo Bruce Adams - WPA Pool/Getty Images)\n\n\"I only hope that she doesn't now give birth to a boy or I'm going to look pretty stupid,\" she said.\n\n\"But she definitely said 'd------'.\"\n\nSt James's Palace did not comment on the matter, although royal sources insisted the couple had not yet found out the sex of the baby, which is due in July.\n\nThere was more baby talk and plenty of gifts for Kate as she went on a ten-minute walkabout outside the National Fishing Heritage Centre.\n\nKate, Duchess of Cambridge, with the teddy bear given to her by Diana Burton, to whom she allegedly said: \"Thank you. I will take that for my d....\" Picture: Splash\n\nOne admirer, Bobbie Brown, 42, asked Kate whether she had felt the baby kicking yet.\n\n\"She said: 'Yes it is, very much so',\" she said.\n\nAlthough it is still one of the largest centres for fish processing in Britain, Grimsby has been in decline since the 1950s and youth unemployment is among the highest in the country.\n\nUnfortunately the Duchess's arrival was almost 90 minutes late after her helicopter was delayed by thick fog.\n\nRoyal artist Paul Emsley explains the new portrait of The Duchess of Cambridge\n\nShe had been due to be collected from Kensington Palace by the Queen's helicopter, known as the Royal Fight, at 10am in time for a 11.35am start. The flight is paid for by taxpayers and will cost around \u00a33,500.\n\nBut dignitaries and flag-waving wellwishers were left shivering in the cold as her pilot waited for a break in the weather.\n\nMany grumbled that the foggy conditions had been known about well in advance and asked why Kate had not simply taken the train, a three-and-a-half hour journey which costs \u00a342.50 each way.\n\nA St James's Palace spokesman said: \"A number of factors are taken into consideration when deciding on transport, including cost, practicality and security arrangements and what the member of the Royal Family is doing before and after the engagement.\"\n\nCatherine, Duchess of Cambridge greets children in Grimsby, England. (Photo Darren Staples - WPA Pool/Getty Images)\n\nAt a later visit to the Humberside Fire and Rescue Service, Claire Moss-Smith, 86, a patient at a local hospice told the Duchess: \"I'm waiting for you to be Queen.\"\n\nKate replied with a smile: \"You might be waiting for a long time.\"\n\nCatherine, Duchess of Cambridge, may have let slip the sex of her unborn baby.

{"id": 2015812096, "title": "20150211 - Bill Shorten and the chamber of petulance", "text": "Bill Shorten and the chamber of petulance\n\nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten in Parliament on Wednesday.\n\nPhoto: Alex Ellinghausen\n\nIf puerile nastiness entertains you, or watching adults behave like petulant adolescents, then Federal Parliament was the show to watch this week. Anyone who witnessed question time, especially from inside the chamber, would have seen small-mindedness triumphant. If Australia is suffering from a failure of political leadership, causing a loss of business confidence and investment, then that failure is clearly bi-partisan.\n\nWith a precipitous decline in revenue as the price of all our major energy exports have plunged, and the Senate serving as a chamber where budget cuts go to die, Australia has a real challenge in finding new sources of revenue and new ways of curbing spending. The government has made efforts, and most of them have been rebuffed in the Senate and rejected by the public. New measures are needed. The time for posturing is over.\n\nIf Australia is suffering from a failure of political leadership, causing a loss of business confidence and investment, then that failure is clearly bi-partisan.\n\nYet this is what the alternate leader of the nation, Bill Shorten had to offer on the first day of Parliament in 2015:\n\nQuestion one: \"Given that nearly half of his parliamentary colleagues, including two-thirds of his Liberal backbenchers, have today expressed a lack of confidence in the Prime Minister, how can the Prime Minister claim to have a mandate from this country?\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo: \"Is the Prime Minister planning to abandon any of his budget measures? Or is he just planning to abandon his Treasurer, as he did at the press conference today?\"\n\nThree: \"I refer to the Liberal member for Brisbane's perceptive comments yesterday: We cannot govern ourselves in an internal climate of fear and intimidation. And that is the unacceptable situation we have endured for the past five years. Does the Prime Minister agree with the member for Brisbane?\"\n\nFour: \"My question is to the Minister for Communications [Malcolm Turnbull]. Minister, why are you still on the front bench?\"\n\nThe answers were (question one) no; (question two) yes; (question three) no; (question four) because I'm not a treacherous back-stabber who helped bring down both leaders I have served under.\n\nMr Shorten then moved a no-confidence motion in the Prime Minister, yet devoted much of his energy to a gratuitous personal attack on Turnbull: \"He, the Zorro of the dispatch box, has said that he wants the job but he will not fight for the job. He is prepared to injure his Prime Minister but he leaves his supporters hanging. He is a veritable ball of ambivalence!\"\n\nAnd so on. Shorten will not be remembered for his wit.\n\nThis week was an opportunity for him to display that he was a better man than the Prime Minister, that he was more than a vindictive point-scorer, that he had policies to address the nation's drift into debt and deficit. He did not take that opportunity. He missed it completely.\n\nThen there were the voyeurs of the opposition, the members waving goodbye to the Prime Minister and Treasurer Joe Hockey. They were led from the front row by Jenny Macklin, who, you would think, would know better, having reached her 60s and been in parliament for 19 years. Nineteen years in which six Labor leaders were deposed in eight leadership changes, with all but Paul Keating departing at the behest of their own colleagues (Kim Beazley, Simon Crean, Mark Latham, Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard).\n\nThe Dummy-Spit Award for the most childish member of the house was a tie between Pat Conroy and Nick Champion, both former union officials and both serial brats. Labor breeds haters. It is famous for that. Even the most colourless in its ranks, like Macklin, can revel in pettiness.\n\nObserving all this was the omnipresent, non-partisan political editor of Sky News, David Speers, who, after noting the bilious gloating of the opposition, also noted that karma had come back to bite the Prime Minister. He pointed out that Abbott had baited Gillard with some similarly goading questions after she had suffered political near-death at the hands of her colleagues.\n\nKarma is also repaying Abbott for his ingloriously unwise comment that \"the adults are back in charge.\"\n\nTuesday was more of the same. Shorten's first question: \"If good government starts today, what on earth has the Prime Minister been doing for the past 521 days?\"\n\nIn summary, the second sitting day of 2015 was almost identical to the first. Unedifying.\n\nWednesday, however, was different. Shorten asked a series of constructive, penetrating questions. Perhaps feedback had come back that he had gone too far, been too nasty, too petty, and his gloating had been bad optics.\n\nTwitter: Paul_Sheehan_\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 12], "id":

{"id": 2013501918, "title": "20130214 - Dorner's 'last stand' after hiding in plain sight", "text": "Dorner's 'last stand' after hiding in plain sight\n\n13 February 2013 Last updated at 19:47 By Alastair Leithead BBC News, Big Bear Lake\n\nThick snow still blankets the small ski town of Big Bear Lake after a weekend storm which had hindered the search for Christopher Dorner.\n\nA massive manhunt led sheriffs here last week after the 33-year-old's truck was found burning on a mountain road.\n\nThe authorities went from house to house in the snow, looking for the ex-policeman who was suspected of double murder and of killing a former colleague while on the run.\n\nThey used snow cat vehicles to scour the area for any sign of the 270lb (122kg) African American, who was not thought to have had any winter survival training.\n\n'Heartbroken'\n\nThe ex-Navy reservist and former police officer was heavily armed. As the trail appeared to go cold, there was speculation that someone else was involved - or that the burning car was a decoy.\n\nSecurity was stepped up across southern California and there were long delays at the US-Mexico border as every vehicle was searched.\n\nBut it appears he was hiding out in one of the hundreds of mountain cabins in the centre of town - just half a mile from the police control centre.\n\n\"We haven't had so much excitement around here in 20 years since that armed bank robbery,\" one local said, getting a coffee as this tourist city 7,000ft (2,133m) up in the mountains could finally relax.\n\nRon White, from Big Bear Donuts, said the locals weren't afraid: \"He was targeting police, not us.\"\n\nPlease turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play.\n\nFootage has emerged of the gunfight which took place at the cabin\n\nThe mayor of Big Bear Lake had said he was more worried that anyone who saw Dorner might have taken the law into their own hands.\n\n\"We are certainly very relieved that residents and tourists are now safe,\" Mayor Jay Obernolte told the BBC as police were still trying to identify the charred remains found in the burned-out cabin.\n\n\"But we are also heartbroken that we lost a sheriff's deputy. Our thoughts go out to his family.\"\n\nHe praised the action of the law enforcement agencies.\n\nWhen asked how they could have missed the suspect in their search, he explained many of the cabins are holiday homes, locked up and left empty. Police could not just smash down every single door.\n\nWho started fire?\n\nBut when Dorner decided to make a run for it back down the mountain and stole a car, the alarm was quickly raised and police were soon in pursuit.\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\nDorner's timeline\n\nFeb 3: Allegedly kills Monica Quan, 28, the daughter of a police captain who assisted Dorner in his disciplinary hearings, and her fiance Keith Lawrence, 27, in Los Angeles\n\nFeb 7: Shoots at two officers in Riverside, California, killing one instantly and injuring the other\n\nFeb 7: Dorner's truck found burning in Big Bear, California\n\nFeb 9: A man alleging to be Dormer calls Quan's father\n\nFeb 12: Dorner is located at a cabin in Big Bear, ensuing shoot-out leaves one officer dead, two injured\n\nThere was an intense gunfight as he tried to escape from a mountain lodge he had barricaded himself into, no doubt aware from his military training that he would be surrounded.\n\nThe mountain roads were sealed off as dozens of police, FBI agents, sheriffs and snipers moved in.\n\nJournalists followed the operation as it unfolded by listening into police radios.\n\nFrom the recordings, since posted online, it appeared the police may have started the fire, which soon overwhelmed the wooden building.\n\nAs the lodge burned and there were mixed reports about whether or not a body had been found in the building, the authorities appeared pretty confident they had got their man.\n\nAt an Italian restaurant in Big Bear, staff and diners were relieved to hear the manhunt was finally over.\n\nIt might be a stereotype but when they said \"it's such a calm place - nothing like that ever happens here,\" it seemed accurate in this laidback mountain town.\n\n'Ghost town'\n\n\"A lot of citizens were worried,\" one diner told me. \"As soon as people heard what was going on, this place was like a ghost town.\"\n\nIt's peak ski season and there's a great combination of California sunshine and well-covered slopes - the bars and restaurants are normally heaving.\n\nOn Wednesday morning police were still blocking roads approaching the valley where the manhunt had come to an end.\n\nThe news helicopters buzzing overhead showed there was little left of the lodge but burned timbers.\n\nIt could be some time before forensic scientists can confirm the body is Dorner, but the manhunt is over.\n\nLife here and down the mountain in Los Angeles, is getting back to normal.\n\nMost of the protection teams deployed to guard dozens of potential targets of the former cop's grudge have returned to normal duty - LAPD is no longer on high alert.\n\nEfforts now will switch to establishing what drove this disgruntled former employee to go on a deadly rampage as some form of revenge.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 6], "id": "Q7612414", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q110094", "Q114650", "Q1938272", "Q2911621", "Q441583",

France\n\nEgyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi is in France for talks on terrorism, the Libyan conflict and other regional issues amid heavy criticism over the Egyptian leader's crackdown on dissent.\n\nThe Egyptian head of state has overseen a large crackdown on critics, jailing thousands of Islamists along with pro-democracy activists.\n\nOver 20 human rights groups denounced France's strategic partnership with Egypt as the country \"is abusively using counter-terrorist legislation to eradicate the legitimate work in favour of human rights and suppress all peaceful dissent in the country.\" They called for a demonstration on Tuesday near the National Assembly in Paris.\n\nEl-Sissi has said that his tough rule has ensured stability, pointing to war and destruction in Syria, Yemen and Libya as the alternative.\n\nAt a press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron, el-Sissi said: \"You cannot present the state of Egypt, with all that it has done for its people and for stability in the region, with it being a dictatorship.\"\n\nHe said that religious values were more important than human values.\n\nMacron said he had discussed the question of human rights with the Egyptian leader.\n\nFrench authorities see Egypt as a key country in efforts to stabilise the troubled region, and Macron has warned that in the absence of Western support, Egypt could turn to the West's authoritarian rivals China and Russia.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [33, 41], "id": "Q79", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1061510", "Q11768",

{"id": 2013390195, "title": "20130608 - Turkey protests pose a new threat to Syria peace efforts", "text": "Turkey protests pose a new threat to Syria peace efforts\n\nEuropeans are worried Turkey's controversial handling of protests over a minor urban development in Istanbul is damaging the whole EU-NATO peacemaking and security project in Syria.\n\nISTANBUL, Turkey, June 7 (UPI) -- Europeans are worried Turkey's handling of protests over a minor urban development in Istanbul is damaging the whole EU-NATO peacemaking and security project in Syria.\n\nTurkey has staked its reputation as a non-partisan, non-Arab arbiter of disputes and flare-ups in its neighborhood and as the modern inheritor of the mantle of the old Ottoman Empire.\n\nArabs tolerated Turkey's role as a mediator and facilitator despite strong reservations about Ottoman rule over their lands before independence or creation of modern Arab states, preferring it to British and French mandates.\n\nBut Turkey bared new ambitions during the turmoil in Iraq after the 2003 allied invasion that brought down Saddam Hussein and more recently in Syria, both former colonies of its Ottoman predecessors.\n\nAs Syria plunged deeper into strife and thousands of Syrians sought refuge in southeastern Turkey, Ankara could convincingly argue it had a stake in Syria's future.\n\nEurope saw Turkey as a valuable rear guard as it tried to shield itself from political and security fallout from Syria. As the Syrian conflict threatened to spill over into Turkey along with the fleeing multitudes, European defense commanders promptly sent and installed Patriot missile batteries along Turkey's Syrian border.\n\nBut it all appeared to be going wrong as Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, riding high approval ratings amid what Turks saw as their country's resurgence as a regional power, began to implement a long-cherished Islamization of the country's deeply entrenched secular society.\n\nLast month authorities began shutting down establishments that served alcohol or what Erdogan aides saw as the lewd westernization of society. With his popularity on the rise, Erdogan easily silenced critics who saw his measures as an attempt to recast Turkey after his own Islamist model.\n\nTurks in general are not against some Islamic elements marking day-to-day pursuits and lifestyle that link them to their heritage and tradition, but most draw a line at what they see as going beyond \"moderation\" -- a term open to heated debate over the decades since Kemal Ataturk ushered in the republic in 1922.\n\nErdogan is adamant that forces inimical to his rule rather than Turkish masses turned the Istanbul protests into a movement increasingly questioning his legitimacy.\n\nHe also shocked European partners by insisting his handling of the protests was mild compared to what EU partners would have done in similar circumstances.\n\nEuropean criticism of Erdogan has been sharp but cautiously coded.\n\nThe protests have also demonstrated that, through years of exposure to mainland Europe and yearning for Turkey's eventual entry into the club of nations, Turks are more Europeanized than the ruling party's ideologues.\n\nMost Turks see the government's conduct as indicative of its eastward push rather than a westward reach to Europe and democratic values enshrined in EU rules for letting new members in.\n\nTurkey has been vying for EU entry since 2005 but lags behind almost everyone being considered as part of EU enlargement. The eight new potential entrants are Albania, Bosnia, Croatia, Iceland, Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey.\n\nEU Enlargement Minister Stefan Fuele, who was in Istanbul for talks, delivered a public reproach.\n\n\"Peaceful demonstrations constitute a legitimate way for groups to express their views in a democratic society,\" Fuele said.\n\n\"Excessive use of force by police against these demonstrations has no place in such a democracy.\"\n\nThe widely publicized chastisement was music to the ears of Erdogan's many foes on the right, left and center of Turkey's volatile political spectrum. The civil strife complicates Turkey's overt support for Syria's armed opposition, based in Istanbul, and a dangerous balancing act with eastern Kurdish factions known to have strong links with armed groups in Syria, Iraq and Iran.\n\nTurkey is a major player in international peacemaking efforts now under way in Syria, involving negotiators from the EU, the United Nations, Russia, the United States and the Arab world.\n\nErdogan has banked on continued popularity, a robust economy and a strong power base within the political establishment, but his response to the protests threatens to change all that.\n\nIstanbul and the southwestern tourism belt were the worst hit after the protests, with hotels reporting mass cancellations. Turkey's service sector provides the bulk of the national earnings -- up to 63 percent according to latest data.\n\nAs the sixth most popular tourism destination in the world, Turkey drew 31 million tourists in 2011. This week the Turkish stock market was reeling under the impact of the protests. Analysts predicted job losses in the service sector, a potent new flashpoint.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 6], "id": "Q43", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates":

Five or six? Are you serious?' one Twitter user said.\n\nAnother said that 'eight is the only acceptable answer', while a different user wrote: 'I'd go up to 7. That one looks nice n gooey on the inside.'\n\n'Really anything from four to seven is acceptable. But five is ideal,' one man said.\n\nMeanwhile, a mother-of-two wrote: 'As an ex-Girl Scout and mom who spends every summer at Boy Scout camp with my two sons: You need a 7 or 8 on that marshmallow char scale to achieve the internal molten gooey-ness to make a proper S'more...'\n\nSimilarly another user, who said she was once a Girl Scout, said: 'Eight is perfect. Most needs to be toasted with a slight burned area. I was a Girl Scout.'\n\nSome others shared stronger opinions on the topic of toasting marshmallows, as one woman said: 'Anyone who chooses one-six must have some real issues in their lives......or they could be diagnosed with ADHD.'\n\n'Always disturbed me, the people who set their marshmallows on fire. Like damn, be patient,' another said.\n\nMeanwhile, one user shared a small 'guide' of their own, as he jokingly detailed what he believes is the meaning behind each marshmallow.\n\n'One-two is a waste of a stick. Three-four is what you give the kids who really want one but are doing what their told.\n\n'Five-six is good seven-eight is being thankful it didn't turn into... nine-ten is a waste of a stick, do not eat that trash,' he added.\n\nAnother said: 'Dude, no. If you can still see white, it ain't right.\n\n'You should have to blow it out after admiring its torch-like qualities. You gotta hear that shishing [sic] sizzle.'\n\nOther users were in total disagreement with the chart. One said: 'There's a massive spectrum between seven-nine that is not fully explored in this image.'\n\nAnother jokingly said: 'Which number is the one where your marshmallow catches on fire, then you wave the stick back and forth to put it out, and the flaming treat slips off, flies through the night air, and sticks to your friend's leg, causing third degree burns?'\n\n'The only correct answer is zero. Graham cracker and chocolate, and NO marshmallow!' one woman said.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 7], "id": "Q918", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1126556", "Q16927722", "Q30099997", "Q7858627", "Q7901759", "Q918"]}, {"span": [114, 121], "id": "Q918", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1126556", "Q16927722", "Q30099997", "Q7858627", "Q7901759", "Q918"]}, {"span": [217, 224], "id": "Q918", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1126556", "Q16927722", "Q30099997", "Q7858627", "Q7901759", "Q918"]}, {"span": [230, 240], "id": "Q41997628", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q41997628"]}, {"span": [568, 582], "id": "Q60", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q60"]}, {"span": [583, 590], "id": "Q918", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1126556", "Q16927722", "Q30099997", "Q7858627", "Q7901759", "Q918"]}, {"span": [1096, 1103], "id": "Q918", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1126556", "Q16927722", "Q30099997", "Q7858627", "Q7901759", "Q918"]}, {"span": [1395, 1399], "id": "<NIL>", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q104055806", "Q1145803", "Q15039770", "Q1526740", "Q15741930", "Q16083122", "Q1930296", "Q1967387", "Q2287303", "Q2455415", "Q2457643", "Q25218794", "Q2825865", "Q3031", "Q51843955", "Q5564333", "Q5564334", "Q5564335", "Q5564336", "Q5564337", "Q5564338", "Q5564339", "Q5564341", "Q5564342", "Q61875850", "Q641066", "Q64841091", "Q655220", "Q67873217", "Q97161765"]}, {"span": [1441, 1450], "id": "Q608132", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q10874690", "Q18121791", "Q1995166", "Q3067851", "Q3097565", "Q3476384", "Q3553444", "Q4118784", "Q4206779", "Q608132", "Q6314445", "Q6528209", "Q7438537", "Q7438538", "Q7438550", "Q7438551", "Q7438565", "Q7438567", "Q7438569", "Q7438574", "Q7438581", "Q7438585", "Q7438588", "Q7438599", "Q7438642", "Q7762673", "Q7887340", "Q849740", "Q872181", "Q941193"]}, {"span": [1955, 1959], "id": "Q181923", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q17985546", "Q181923", "Q18636027", "Q18712720", "Q1993146", "Q4647086", "Q4647087", "Q61788429", "Q90047383"]}], "evaluation_span": [1265, 1751], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [1287, 1291], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY", "coref": false}, {"id": 1, "span": [1295, 1300], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY", "coref": false}, {"id": 2, "span": [1320, 1324], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY", "coref": false}, {"id": 3, "span": [1336, 1343], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER", "desc": true, "coref": false}, {"id": 4, "span": [1362, 1377], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER", "desc": true, "coref": false}, {"id": 6, "span": [1464, 1467], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY", "coref": false}, {"id": 7, "span": [1485, 1486], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY", "coref": false}, {"id": 8, "span": [1490, 1491], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY", "coref": false}, {"id": 9, "span": [1582, 1588], "entity_id": "Q2339814", "name": "s'more", "type": "Q2424752", "coref": false}, {"id": 10, "span": [1604, 1616], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER", "desc": true, "coref": false}, {"id": 12, "span": [1661, 1666], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY", "coref": false}]}
{"id": 20171932977, "title": "20170504 - Former ballerina says pressure fuelled her eating disorder", "text": "Former ballerina says pressure fuelled her eating disorder\n\nA former ballerina has described how the pressure to be 'lean' led her to develop an eating disorder that nearly ended her life.\n\nAnais Garcia, from Baltimore, Maryland, told how she starved herself in a desperate bid to please dance teachers who favoured 'taller and thinner' students.\n\nAt the height of her sickness she weighed just 80lbs (5.7st) and was told by doctors that if she danced again her heart would stop.\n\nNow the 20-year-old is recovering from the illness and is determined to help other dancers struggling with body image and eating disorders.\n\nAnais, who majored in dance at a performing arts high school, said staff and students placed a 'huge emphasis' on body type.\n\n'You wear skin tight leotards and tights in front of full length mirrors for hours each day,' she said. 'I was constantly told to change my body, specifically to develop longer and leaner muscles.\n\n'Many teachers promote the dancers who are thinner and taller and ignore the dancers who are not.'\n\nShare this article\n\nShare\n\n426 shares\n\nEager to win better parts, Anais started to diet. At the age of 16 she was surviving on just 600 calories a day. This developed into restriction, purging and over-exercising.\n\nShe continued: 'When I began to lose weight unhealthily, I was awarded with multiple lead roles for the first time and placed in the highest level.\n\n'This fuelled my disorder and only made me more determined to get sicker.'\n\nBy the time she graduated, Anais was battling a severe eating disorder and was hospitalised during her first year of university.\n\nShe was forced to give up ballet and gained 20lbs. However 18 months after she returned to dance she suffered a 'very deadly relapse'.\n\nShe said: 'I was devastated because after all the sacrifice and work, I had regressed to a point even lower than before.\n\n'This time it was different. No longer was I purging, abusing laxatives, or over exercising. This time I simply refused to eat; it was anorexia at its worst.\n\n'I would dance for hours with nothing in my system, and I would rely on caffeine to get me through each day.'\n\nHer turning point came when she was rushed to the emergency room after collapsing on a photo shoot.\n\nShe said: 'I felt really weak and delirious however, I wasn't scared. I thought I was going to die and I felt at peace knowing that I wouldn't suffer anymore from my eating disorder.\n\n'It's sad to say but at the time I wouldn't have minded dying. I felt bad that my mum had to see me so sick. This event really woke me up to the reality of my disorder.'\n\nAnais pledged to gain weight, saying she was 'fueled by her anger, determination and fear'.\n\nShe forced herself to meal prep and up her calories each week until she had reached 2000 calories a day.\n\nShe added: 'The most important thing I did was rest. My body had a lot to catch up on, so I slept for weeks.\n\n'Slowly but surely my energy began returning and my weight began increasing.\n\n'I only weighed myself at the doctor's office because I refused to be a slave to the scale in my own house considering I use to weigh myself after each meal.'\n\nNow she is reclaiming control over her life both mentally and physically.\n\nShe said: 'In the past, I would turn down invitations, parties, meals, anything that possibly involved food.\n\n'Now, I am rediscovering life and it's many benefits.

{"id": 2007145307, "title": "20070928 - Tonga have been one of the major surprises in this tournament.", "text": "\nTonga have been one of the major surprises in this tournament.\n\nAfter beating the USA, they upset Pacific Island neighbours Samoa before giving South Africa, one of the form sides and competition favourites, a big scare.\n\nThe Springboks, who eventually won 30-25, were forced to send their frontline players into the fray as the Tongans threatened to pull off a major upset.\n\nComing into the competition, Tonga, who are bidding to reach the last eight for the first time, only had two wins in three World Cups and lost every match in 2003.\n\n\"We have already made history for our country,\" said captain Nili Latu. \"We want to go further.\"\n\nCoach Quddus Fielea added: \"It is very important for the boys, and I know they will be throwing everything into this game.\"\n\nIn contrast to Tonga, England have failed to play to their potential in this World Cup.\n\nAfter beating the USA, they were crushed 36-0 by South Africa before bouncing back with a 44-22 win over Samoa.\n\nNow their chances of progressing face another serious threat - and England coach Brian Ashton is under no illusions about the size of the task facing his side.\n\n\"We are still looking down the barrel of a gun,\" he said.\n\n\"Tonga are probably a stronger side than Samoa and they are no longer the surprise team. They've played pretty well throughout and we have enormous respect for them.\n\n\"They have a massive enthusiasm, cohesion up front and an ability to stay in the game for 80 minutes, which has not always been the case.\n\n\"Any momentary lapse in concentration could cause us lots of problems.\"\n\nWith prop Vickery starting the game on the bench following his two-game ban, Martin Corry will skipper the side.\n\nAnd the Leicester forward says the team will not make the mistake of underestimating Tonga.\n\n\"We are going to have to win the game, and we expect to win the game, but that is taking nothing away from Tonga,\" he said.\n\n\"They are coming into this game full of confidence, but we are just focusing on ourselves and looking to improve on what we did against Samoa.\"\n\nAshton has made some bold choices in his selection, leaving Vickery on the bench and bringing Lewis Moody in at open-side flanker for his first start of the tournament.\n\nBut Jonny Wilkinson will continue his half-back partnership with scrum-half Andy Gomarsall.\n\nWilkinson missed the first two games of the tournament because of an ankle injury but kicked 24 points on his return as England beat Samoa.\n\nHe now needs another 22 points to become the record points scorer in World Cups, eclipsing the 227 amassed by Scotland great Gavin Hastings.\n\nEngland and Tonga have met only once before in an officially recognised Test. It came in the 1999 World Cup, with England easing to a 101-10 victory.\n\nBut this time round promises to be a lot closer, with Latu promising: \"We are going to throw the kitchen sink at England.\n\n\"People back home have been over the moon with what we have done, and it is rewarding for us to see where the country is now. Even being here is bringing Tongans together as one, but it's not just for us.\n\n\"We are here to do a job and change the face of rugby in the Islands, and in Tonga especially.\"\n\nThe Tongans had planned to take to the field with their hair dyed green to thank an Irish bookmaker for supporting them financially in France.\n\nBut the International Rugby Board says that would constitute advertising and has ordered Tonga not to go ahead with the publicity stunt.\n\nEngland: Lewsey; Sackey, Tait, Barkley, Cueto; Wilkinson, Gomarsall; Sheridan, Chuter, Stevens, Borthwick, Kay, Corry

{"id": 2016287481, "title": "20161125 - Storm Otto kills four in Costa Rica, moves out to Pacific", "text": "Storm Otto kills four in Costa Rica, moves out to Pacific\n\nSAN JOSE Tropical storm Otto killed at least four people and forced thousands to evacuate after battering Nicaragua and Costa Rica with hurricane-force winds and torrential rains, then moved out into the Pacific Ocean.\n\nOtto hit the coast on Thursday from the Atlantic as a hurricane in southeastern Nicaragua, but weakened rapidly and became a tropical storm by early Friday as it drifted deeper into the Pacific, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.\n\nIn Costa Rica, the national emergency commission (CNE) reported that two men and two women were killed by the storm, which dumped over a month's worth of rain in some areas near the Nicaraguan border. Some 255 communities were affected, with over 5,500 people housed in 50 shelters across the country, the CNE said.\n\n\"After a fateful night in parts of the country, we're starting to realize the scale of the tragedy that hit us,\" Costa Rican President Luis Guillmero Solis told a news conference.\n\nNevertheless, in Nicaragua, there were no immediate reports of deaths. In the port of Bluefields, north of where the storm landed, there was very limited damage.\n\n\"It was a relief for us,\" said William Salmeron, a 39-year-old businessman in the city. \"I wasn't scared, just the normal fear you need to have with hurricanes.\"\n\nThe sun shone in Bluefields on Friday, and people went shopping in the market. Down by the shore, others took their boats out of storage and down to the water.\n\nAcross Nicaragua, people in evacuation shelters were making their way home, local authorities said.\n\nOtto, the seventh Atlantic hurricane of the season, landed north of the town of San Juan de Nicaragua as a Category 2 storm, the Miami-based NHC said.\n\nBy Friday morning Otto was heading out to the Pacific with top sustained winds of 65 mph (105 kph) and churning about 245 miles (394 km) south-southeast of San Salvador.\n\nIn a freakish coincidence, soon after Otto landed on Thursday, a 7.0-magnitude quake struck 93 miles (149 km) southwest of Puerto Triunfo, El Salvador.\n\nThere were no reports of major damage from the quake, which along with Otto, prompted Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega to declare a state of emergency.\n\n(Additional reporting by Ivan Castro in Bluefields; Writing by Gabriel Stargardter)\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [6, 10], "id": "<NIL>", "recognized_by":

BALDOR Associated Press Writer\n\nThe Associated Press\n\n\nThe United States must deliver weapons to Iraq more quickly, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Thursday, in the wake of an announcement that the Iraqis have ordered $100 million in military equipment from China.\n\nHe agreed that there are concerns that it is harder for the U.S. military in Iraq to track weapons purchased from countries other than America. In many cases, the Iraqis cannot account for weapons, which often end up in the hands of insurgents.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Gates said the issue also came up at his meeting with Chilean Defense Minister Jose Mario Goni just prior to a news conference.\n\n\"This is an issue that we have to look into and see what we can do in the United States to be more responsive and be able to react more quickly to the requests of our friends,\" Gates said. \"Unfortunately the (foreign military sales) program was set up in a way that was not intended to provide sort of emergency or short term supplies.\"\n\nThe Washington Post reported Thursday that Iraqi President Jalal Talabani said in an interview that Iraq ordered the Chinese weapons for its police force in part because the U.S. is not delivering the arms fast enough.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 2], "id": "Q30", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1116609", "Q11211", "Q11220", "Q11223",

Add your meat - I really like to use pork and sage in a lasagne. Brown off meat and add sage then add a glug of wine.\n\n4. Next add some whole plum tomatoes, tinned, and sweat that down.\n\n5. Add puree, some stock, salt and sugar to counteract the acidity of the tomatoes, some chilli flakes and let that bubble down for about two hours.\n\nFor plain tomato sauce:\n\n1.

{"id": 2008435436, "title": "20080401 - Hangzhou Municipal Government Selects TIBCO Software for Enhancing Efficiency of E-Government Services", "text": "Hangzhou Municipal Government Selects TIBCO Software for Enhancing Efficiency of E-Government Services\n\n/PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- TIBCO Software Inc. (Nasdaq: TIBX) today announced\nthat the Hangzhou Municipal Government has successfully completed the\ndeployment of TIBCO Enterprise Message Service (TM) and TIBCO ActiveMatrix\nBusinessWorks (TM) for its government information sharing and business\ncollaboration initiative to facilitate the integration and real-time flow of\ndata across its information systems.\n\nPrior to the project, cross-departmental information sharing had been a\nmajor challenge for the municipal authorities, as various departments had\nadopted differing technology standards. In addition, the Web sites of the\nvarious levels of government -- from the municipality down to villages and\ntownships -- had been developed independently, impeding timely information\ndistribution to the public. However, using the TIBCO Enterprise Message\nService as its information backbone and TIBCO ActiveMatrix BusinessWorks for\nsoftware integration through service-oriented architecture, the municipal\ngovernment's information sharing and business collaboration initiative has\nbeen able to leverage its existing information systems, while paving the way\nfor future services and growth.\n\n\"TIBCO's integration and real-time information processing solutions have\nallowed us to create a centralized, multi-level framework for information\ncataloging and sharing, even though our data exchanges are physically\ndispersed. The near instantaneous access to information we gain from this\nsystem across multiple departments empowers us to carry out our duties,\nincluding tax administration and regulatory enforcement, more efficiently, and\nmake better policy decisions for our people,\" said Guo Liqiao, deputy director\nof Hangzhou Municipal Government Informatization Office.\n\nMr. Guo said TIBCO was selected for the e-government project after an\nevaluation of several integration and real-time information processing\nsolutions, and an onsite visit to one of TIBCO's other customers.\n\n\"TIBCO's software was simply the fastest, most secure and most reliable\nsolution we evaluated. And importantly, TIBCO allowed us to achieve real-time\ndata exchange in a multi-vendor environment, so we did not need to replace the\nincompatible legacy applications and platforms that had been deployed\nthroughout government,\" Mr. Guo explained.\n\nAs the informatization of the civil services government continues to\ngather momentum across China, TIBCO has set its sights on increasing its\npenetration into the country's e-government market.\n\n\"Bringing government services online will have a number of tangible\nbenefits for both the authorities and the public. While enabling authorities\nto perform administrative duties and disseminate information quickly and more\nefficiently, e-government will also provide individuals and businesses with\neasier access to information, streamlined reporting requirements and faster\ntransaction channels. The savings in time and money for everyone are\npotentially enormous,\" said Ram Menon, executive vice president, Worldwide\nMarketing, at TIBCO Software.\n\n\nTIBCO Software Inc. (NASDAQ: TIBX) provides enterprise software that helps\ncompanies achieve service-oriented architecture (SOA) and business process\nmanagement (BPM) success.

(Reuters / Robert Galbrait / David McNew)\n\nIt appears that both the Democrats and Microsoft took a beating on Tuesday, after CNN presenters ignored a corporate sponsorship deal by turning the tech giant's $799 Surface tablet into the world's most expensive iPad kickstand on air.\n\nCNN received the Surface Pro 3 tablets from Microsoft as part of an election 2014 partnership deal, along with an updated Multi-Touch Collaboration Wall, colloquially known as CNN's \"Magic Wall,\" to be used on air.\n\nAnd while the Microsoft tablets were featured prominently during CNN's Tuesday night election coverage, it was what was going on behind the scenes that really got everyone's attention.\n\nWhile the \"barricade of Pro 3s\" managed to cover the clandestine iPad activity during straight shots, the panning camera revealed Jake Tapper tapping away on his iPad one finger at a time.\n\nIn another shot, political contributor Ana Navarro could clearly be seen using her Pro 3 to prop up her Apple tablet.\n\nAstute social media users quickly began circulating the images online, a few employing the hashtag #productplacementfail.\n\nThis is not the first time Microsoft has ended up with egg on its face after inking a promotional deal to pull its Pro 3 out from under a massive apple-shaped shadow.\n\nEarlier this year, Microsoft and the NFL agreed upon a five-year $400 million deal which required that the Microsoft Surface became \"the official tablet of the NFL.\" During live broadcasts, coaches and players were expected to use the tablet on the sidelines during games. It must have been a bitter (and expensive) pill to swallow when commentators began referring to the Surface as \"iPad-like tools\" or even simply \"iPads.\"\n\nSpeaking with CNet, CNN's chief synergizer, Matt Dornic, said their arrangement with Microsoft was nothing like the NFL deal. According to Dornic, the Surfaces were there to help connect with CNNs Magic Wall, which works best with Microsoft's Internet Explorer.\n\n\"There was no product-placement deal,\" he said.\n\nMicrosoft is yet to comment on the incident.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 3], "id": "Q48340", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1104153",

Here, I kind of have to do a recap of my 25-year career.\n\n'I started when I was six years old, so it's hard to make that story short! I'm glad that I get to share it with the world now, though.'\n\nEarlier this year, Chris was slapped with a restraining order from his 29-year-old ex Karrueche, alleging that he threatened to kill her.\n\nIn June 2009, the singer pleaded guilty after violently attacking his then-girlfriend Rihanna in his car the night before that year's Grammy Awards. He was sentenced to community labour, five years of probation and domestic violence counselling.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 11], "id": "Q155700", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by":

Troopers said the bears left the area after one of the victims used pepper spray.\n\nThe names of the guides were not immediately released. Officials said they are crew members of the 74-passenger cruise vessel Wilderness Explorer and were leading 22 people on the hike in southeast Alaska.\n\nThe injured woman was flown to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, where she was listed Friday in serious condition in intensive care, according to hospital spokeswoman Susan Gregg.\n\nBoth guides were initially transported by helicopter to

{"id": 2019182345, "title": "20190404 - 2020 Democratic candidates - CNNPolitics", "text": "2020 Democratic candidates - CNNPolitics\n\nHere's a look at the Democrats who have thrown their hats into the ring. We're going to keep updating this list through the campaign season as candidates announce their intentions or drop their bids.\n\nSTATE: New Jersey\n\nKNOWN FOR: Booker, who boasts a Twitter following of more than 4 million people, gained national recognition during his tenure as Newark's mayor, at times answering pleas to shovel residents out after major snowstorms.\n\n\n\nKNOWN FOR: The son of a Chicana activist, Castro served as mayor of San Antonio in 2009, focusing on education initiatives. Castro is currently the only Latino in the 2020 field, but whether he will be the only Texan will depend on former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke's decision about making his own bid.\n\n\nSTATE: Maryland\n\nKNOWN FOR: A self-made businessman, Delaney at one point was the youngest CEO on the New York Stock Exchange. Delaney has been running the longest -- he declared his candidacy in July 2017 -- but is still working to gain name recognition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATE: California\n\n\nSTATE: Colorado\n\nKNOWN FOR: As the head of Colorado from 2011 to 2019, Hickenlooper helped steer the state through several tragedies, including the 2012 shooting in a movie theater in Aurora that left 12 people dead and catastrophic wildfires and floods in 2013. Before his two terms as governor, he served as Denver's mayor for eight years, after opening a large brewpub there in 1988 that went on to help reinvigorate the LoDo area of Denver.\n\n\nSTATE: Washington\n\nKNOWN FOR: Inslee, who has held elected office for much of the last three decades, has been an outspoken progressive executive since he became governor in 2013. He has been a vocal opponent of President Donald Trump, including suing the President after he tried to ban immigration from several Muslim-majority countries. Now, Inslee is running as the climate change candidate.\n\nKNOWN FOR: Klobuchar announced her run outdoors as it snowed, which she tied to her commitment to a \"homegrown\" campaign with \"grit.\" The Minnesota moderate is looking to work across the aisle and win back fellow working class midwesterners.\n\n\nSTATE: Florida\n\nKNOWN FOR: The child of Jamaican immigrants, Messam is a first-generation American who holds progressive views on immigration, guns and the environment. He was part of a group that sued the state of Florida in 2018 over a law that restricted his ability to create municipal gun regulations after he wanted a new amphitheater in his city to be a \"gun-free venue.\"\n\n\n\nKNOWN FOR: O'Rourke, a rising star in the Democratic Party, ran unsuccessfully for a Senate seat in 2018 while serving his third term in the House. With roots in El Paso, O'Rourke gained national attention during his Senate race when a video of him answering a question about NFL players kneeling during the National Anthem went viral. He made an off-the-cuff riff about the civil rights movement as he defended players for making their case \"nonviolently, peacefully, while the eyes of this country are watching.\"\n\n\n\nKNOWN FOR: Ryan, whose district includes Youngstown, Ohio, enters the presidential race as a longshot candidate with less name recognition than most candidates and a far smaller political network. He has become most known in Democratic circles for his opposition to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi retaining her leadership positions, though he later voted for her when Democrats elected her speaker earlier this year.\n\n\nSTATE: Vermont\n\nKNOWN FOR: Sanders' democratic socialist platform gained significant traction during the 2016 primaries, when the independent senator who caucuses with Democrats ran against Hillary Clinton. His policy agenda includes various progressive proposals, many of which have been embraced by the Democratic Party, like expanding health care, broadening the social safety net and making higher education free.\n\n\nSTATE: Massachusetts\n\nKNOWN FOR: Warren was appointed as assistant to President Barack Obama and special adviser to the Treasury secretary in order to launch the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. She was also appointed to a congressional oversight panel overseeing the $700 billion Trouble Assets Relief Program that was passed in response to the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n\n\nKNOWN FOR: Williamson is best known for being a spiritual counselor to Oprah Winfrey and has written several best-selling books, including her debut \"A Return to Love.\" She is calling for \"a moral and spiritual awakening in the country\" with her campaign.\n\n\n\nKNOWN FOR: Yang is an entrepreneur who launched Venture for America, a fellowship program that aims to connect recent grads with startups. He wants to give all Americans a universal basic income of $1,000 per month to address economic inequality.\n\nAnnounced exploratory committees\n\n\nSTATE: Indiana\n\nKNOWN FOR: Known locally in South Bend, Indiana, as \"Mayor Pete,\" Buttigieg served as a naval officer in Afghanistan. Buttigieg, though a long shot, would be the youngest and first openly gay president if elected.\n\nConsidering a run\n\nFormer Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams\n\nSen. Michael Bennet\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden\n\nMontana Gov. Steve Bullock\n\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio\n\nFormer Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel\n\nFormer Secretary of State John Kerry\n\nFormer Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe\n\nRep. Seth Moulton\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell\n\nDecided not to run\n\n\n\nKNOWN FOR: A liberal populist, Brown won three terms in Ohio, a state that has been trending Republican in recent years. Brown would've offered Democrats a candidate who could reconnect with voters in the Midwest. Before deciding not to run, he had embarked on a \"listening tour\" that included stops in the four key early voting states in the 2020 primary.\n\n\n\nKNOWN FOR: Bloomberg hinted at a run for months before deciding against it. He had portrayed himself as a moderate against progressive projects such as Medicare-for-all but with extensive experience and campaign funds to put toward key Democratic issues such as climate change and gun control.\n\n\n\nKNOWN FOR: Holder served as President Barack Obama's attorney general until 2015. Holder had told several Democrats -- and \"The Late Show\" host Stephen Colbert -- that he was \"interested\" in pursuing the nomination, but ultimately he opted not to launch a campaign.\n\n\n\nKNOWN FOR: Merkley, the junior senator from Oregon, has focused on holding the Trump administration accountable on immigration policy, specifically family separations at the southern border. He opted in March to devote himself to his Senate re-election campaign over the next two years.\n\nDropped out\n\n\nSTATE: West Virginia (dropped out January 25, 2019)\n\nKNOWN FOR: A former Army paratrooper, Ojeda served for 24 years, earning the rank of major and serving in both Iraq and Afghanistan. A 2016 Trump voter, he focused on school finance reform and issues facing the middle class before dropping out of the race in late January.\n\nCNN's Steve Brusk, Riddhi Sarkar, Sophie Tatum, Gregory

The Dutchman only returned to action late last year after a nine-month injury lay-off and the latest set-back highlights the concern that still surrounds him. Roma coach Rudi Garcia has admitted it is \"still a delicate area.\"\n\nManchester United face competition from Real Madrid in their bid to sign Athletic Bilbao defender Aymeric Laporte. The highly-rated 20-year-old has been linked with a move to the Premier League, and United are ready to firm that up with a bid for the France Under-21 international, according to the Daily Mail. However, with Sergio Ramos stalling on a new contract at the Bernabeu, the European champions have entered the race to sign Laporte from their La Liga rivals.\n\n\nDespite featuring sparingly this season, Adnan Januzaj is unlikely to leave United before next week's transfer deadline. Speaking to Italian media outlet Foot Mercato, Januzaj's agent Dirk de Vriese confirmed interest has come from PSG, but United manager Van Gaal has personally halted any potential departure - temporary or permanent.\n\nDe Vriese said: \"Yes, PSG have shown themselves to be interested this winter. They directly contacted Manchester United for information. But Louis van Gaal announced that he [Januzaj] cannot leave this winter. Not as a permanent transfer nor as a loan. The coach considered him as an important player for squad. He is counting on everyone. It seems like a definitive decision, I don't think that it can change.\"\n\nJanuzaj\n\nRead more:\n\n\nDarren Fletcher has been told he can leave Old Trafford on a free-transfer. The Scot was made vice-captain when Van Gaal arrived at the club and was a fixture in the side during pre-season. But the arrivals of various players in big-money deals has seen him fall down the pecking order and United are prepared to let him leave. Numerous clubs have been linked, including West Ham.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 17], "id": "Q18656", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1812021", "Q18656",

{"id": 201754217, "title": "20170203 - Council members, pension board wrangle over fossil-fuel investments", "text": "Council members, pension board wrangle over fossil-fuel investments\n\nAfter 11 drafts and months of behind-the-scenes negotiations, a bill to start divesting Montgomery County's employee pension funds from fossil-fuel company stocks is nowhere near a final vote.\n\nFossil-fuel holdings represent just $70 million of the county's $4 billion pension portfolio. But the debate has become a broader fight over power, prerogative and the best way for the liberal-minded county to fight climate change.\n\nThe bill, sponsored by Council President Roger Berliner (D-Potomac-Bethesda) and Council member Nancy Navarro (D-Mid-County), has drawn fierce opposition from many retirees as well as the board that oversees their money.\n\nThe thirteen-member Board of Investment Trustees regards the bill as unwarranted interference with the panel's legal obligation to maximize returns.\n\nBoard chairman Gino Renne told county lawmakers that there is no disagreement about the moral urgency of limiting climate change. But policies are in place directing professional fund managers to seek out socially responsible investments, he said, rendering the legislative proposal unnecessary.\n\n\"None of us on the board disagrees with the goal. We're not taking a blind eye to climate change,\" Renne said Thursday at a council committee work session on the bill. \"Trust us. We're not novices.\"\n\nThe proposal is supported by the Montgomery chapter of 350.org, the grass-roots group whose name refers to the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide many scientists say the planet must achieve to avoid the most severe consequences of climate change.\n\nPassage of the bill would make the county one of the largest jurisdictions in the country to join the fossil-fuel divestiture movement. San Francisco, Seattle and Portland are among the localities that have approved some form of divestment.\n\nSince the bill's introduction last fall, Berliner has agreed to significant revisions. A measure requiring complete divestment after five years has been dropped. New language sharpens a provision that the board would not be required to do anything it considered inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under law.\n\nBerliner expressed exasperation that opponents were not reassured by his amendments. He noted that the board has opposed past efforts by the council to regulate certain county investments to advance social or political interests.\n\nIn 1986, the council enacted a law requiring the board to restrict certain investments in companies doing business in South Africa. The measure was rolled back when apartheid ended. In 2008, the council barred investments in companies doing business in Sudan.\n\n\"I and some of my colleagues just struggle as to whether this is in fact drawing a line in the sand saying . . . keep your nose out of our business,\" Berliner said.\n\nRenne and Linda Herman, the board's executive director, agreed to continue discussions with the council and reconvene on the issue later this month.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [157, 174], "id": "Q488659", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q2283212", "Q26756", "Q269164", "Q374547", "Q378527",

That's why we called on regulators to take a greater role in protecting residents and hold care homes to account where needed.\"\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"Abuse of vulnerable people in care is abhorrent, and we're determined to stop it.\"\n\nYou can read more about Betty's story in the new Katie Morley Investigates column on p4 of the Money section in tomorrow's paper\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [84, 90], "id": "Q9630", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1048192", "Q1142007", "Q13440398", "Q178790", "Q190219", "Q208701", "Q210703", "Q216082", "Q275441", "Q28161", "Q3179541", "Q34581", "Q3485549", "Q503614", "Q5291057", "Q55604512", "Q59029", "Q6016713", "Q608190", "Q628967", "Q6396591", "Q6467372", "Q6467545", "Q6508513", "Q656365", "Q684886", "Q6958747", "Q832685", "Q949973", "Q9630"]}, {"span": [97, 114], "id": "Q24668273", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q24668273"]}, {"span": [628, 631], "id": "Q18363996", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1026832", "Q1053463", "Q10538", "Q1116201", "Q1137230", "Q1137234", "Q11733861", "Q15897109", "Q1655426", "Q1772201", "Q18363996", "Q2946927", "Q2989973", "Q36312", "Q3705105", "Q3792262", "Q411948", "Q4806125", "Q5012845", "Q5025794", "Q5030342", "Q5030349", "Q505588", "Q5065197", "Q5100551", "Q5176442", "Q65588044", "Q7889459", "Q906716", "Q955990"]}, {"span": [1126, 1162], "id": "Q3044742", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q16829382", "Q3044742"]}, {"span": [1291, 1296], "id": "<NIL>", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1083155", "Q16746418", "Q18043217", "Q18149337", "Q213122", "Q2562776", "Q2900232", "Q3051256", "Q3639189", "Q4085992", "Q469198", "Q4802805", "Q4898693", "Q4898694", "Q4898710", "Q4898758", "Q4898790", "Q4898815", "Q4898848", "Q4898863", "Q60770361", "Q614768", "Q616633", "Q65087050", "Q656219", "Q697583", "Q850238", "Q850421", "Q86703458", "Q97929991"]}, {"span": [1316, 1328], "id": "<NIL>", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": []}], "evaluation_span": [84, 836], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [84, 90], "entity_id": "Q9630", "name": "Labour Party", "type": "Q43229", "coref": false}, {"id": 1, "span": [91, 93], "entity_id": "Q16707842", "name": "Member of Parliament", "type": "Q4164871", "coref": false}, {"id": 2, "span": [94, 114], "entity_id": "Q24668273", "name": "Rosena Allin-Khan", "type": "Q215627", "coref": false}, {"id": 3, "span": [170, 196], "entity_id": "<NIL>", "name": "Unknown", "type": "OTHER", "children": [5], "desc": true, "coref": false}, {"id": 5, "span": [178, 180], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY", "parent": 3, "coref": false}, {"id": 6, "span": [628, 631], "entity_id": "Q18363996", "name": "Competition and Markets Authority", "type": "Q43229", "coref": false}, {"id": 7, "span": [632, 641], "entity_id": "Q17221", "name": "spokesperson", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871", "coref": false}]}

The company is scheduled to deliver the ship to the Navy in 2021.\n\nSeventeen Virginia-class submarines have been commissioned, and 11 are under construction.\n\nAll but two of subs -- the John Warner and the Hyman G Rickover -- are named after states.\n\nThe New Jersey was named in 2015 in Jersey City,\n\n\"New Jersey's relationship with our Navy has been defined by innovation, leadership, and courage- in conquest and in combat,\" Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus said at the time. \"The name of our newest nuclear-powered fast-attack submarine will carry on that strong tradition.\"\n\nThe Navy's first submarine, USS Holland, was designed and constructed in 1900 in New Jersey.\n\nTwo naval ships have been named New Jersey, a battleship commissioned in 1906 that was part of the Great White Fleet and another battleship commissioned in 1943.\n\nEach Virginia-class submarine is 7,800 tons and 377 feet in length, and can operate at more than 25 knots submerged.

But the Swans showed courage to post a gutsy win and leave Port Adelaide's premiership hopes in tatters.\n\nA disappointed Port Adelaide coach Ken Hinkley after the Power lost to the Swans. Picture: Phil Hillyard Source: News Corp Australia\n\nKEN Hinkley has one simple message for Port Adelaide - \"Man, up\" or perish.\n\nHinkley has demanded his men show the gumption that depleted Sydney delivered as they scored a 10-point win without injured midfielder Gary Rohan (hamstring) and key defender Ted Richards.\n\nIt was a case of \"no Kurt Tippett, no Lance Franklin, no issue\" as Sam Reid and Adam Goodes shared six goals against a Port defence missing a sick Jackson Trengove.\n\nTippett and Franklin were watching from the stands as a 199cm former Tasmanian fast bowler, Toby Nankervis, celebrated his debut with a second term goal.\n\n\"Our own skill errors are killing us at times,\" said Hinkley referring to Port's 65 turnovers against the Swans - including with Jasper Pittard's last-quarter error which handed Lewis Jetta a crucial final-term goal.\n\n\"It's the pressure they (the Power players) feel out on the footy field but you have to be better than that. Man up, that's what we have to do in those times.\"\n\nHowever Pittard wasn't Port worst player.\n\nBrad Ebert well held by Luke Parker.\n\nPort ruckman Matt Lobbe and Paddy Ryder won hit outs 63-35 but didn't goal.\n\nJay Schulz is unlikely to front next week due to concerning form or pending suspension.\n\nHinkley refuses to give up on the season but Port needs to prevail in eight of nine games starting next Thursday against Collingwood at Adelaide Oval.\n\n\"Richmond won nine of nine last year, it is always there and we cling to the chance we can turn our form around and get it back to where it needs to be,\" said Hinkley.\n\n\"It is starting to get harder and harder.\"\n\nPlay was stopped for six minutes after Richards\" injury at the 10-minute mark of the third term from a Schulz tackle.\n\nHinkley noted the game changed from that moment, though Port had threatened to run away from a tiring Sydney. Instead two goals from Adam Goodes provided a 24-point three-quarter time lead.\n\n\"I thought there was a crucial moment in the game,\" said Hinkley.\n\n\"The momentum was in our favour and you have to admire, tough hard footy - we didn't stand up for 16 or 17 minutes in the back half of the third quarter the way you have to in footy.\n\n\"Our history says we have to fight harder and we weren't prepared to.\"\n\nOriginally published as Time for Power to \"man up\": Hinkley\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 13], "id": "Q948900", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED",

{"id": 201914061, "title": "20190411 - Black Hole, William Barr, Human Species: Your Wednesday Evening Briefing", "text": "Black Hole, William Barr, Human Species: Your Wednesday Evening Briefing\n\n(Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.)\n\nGood evening. Here's the latest.\n\nSeparately, SpaceX's Falcon Heavy, the world's most powerful rocket in operation, is set to launch at 8 p.m. Eastern time, carrying a Saudi Arabian communications satellite. You can watch.\n\n2. President Trump sharpened his anti-immigration message through the voices of his base.\n\nDuring a high-dollar fund-raiser in Texas, Mr. Trump urged several donors to stand up and describe finding the bodies of migrants. The president, pictured arriving in San Antonio, said that he had never heard the stories of migrants dying, even from his top immigration and border patrol officials.\n\n\"Dangerous people are coming here and the good people are dying,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that all the donors had told him that building a border wall was the answer.\n\nFor years, both political parties have tried - and failed - to overhaul the nation's immigration laws, mindful that someday the system could reach a breaking point. That time may be now, our reporters write in a sweeping analysis.\n\n3. \"Spying did occur\" on the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election, Attorney General William Barr told lawmakers.\n\nAppearing before Congress for a second consecutive day, Mr. Barr said he would review \"both the genesis and the conduct of intelligence activities directed at the Trump campaign,\" including possible improper \"spying\" by American intelligence agencies.\n\nMr. Barr shifted slightly on when he would make public a redacted version of the Mueller report on Russian interference in the election. On Tuesday, he said \"within a week,\" but today, he said he hoped to deliver it \"next week.\"\n\n\n6. Alaska is the fastest-warming state in the country.\n\nIn March, temperatures were as much as 20 degrees above historical averages. And when the ice softens early, it can spell serious danger. Alaskans are not just accustomed to hard-frozen winters, they depend on them for essential transportation, subsistence hunting, industry and recreation. Above, Portage Lake, where a namesake glacier is no longer in sight.\n\nThis weekend, The Times Magazine dedicates an entire issue to climate change, including this story about the intersection of policymaking and economics.\n\nSeparately, we're tracking a powerful, though not uncommon, storm in the Midwest. Denver could get up to 10 inches of snow, and temperatures plunged well below freezing from the mid-70s in a day. The storm is also headed for states recently hit by flooding.\n\n\n7. Speaking of climate change: More than 3,500 Amazon employees urged the company to take bold action to reduce its carbon footprint. They're using their power as shareholders to press for a concrete plan.\n\nThey also urged Amazon to stop offering custom cloud computing services that help the oil and gas industry explore for and extract more fossil fuels.\n\nIn other tech news, Uber gave the first sign of how big its initial offering might be: The ride-sharing giant told some investors that its stock sale may value it at up to $100 billion.\n\n8. The songwriter who helped give Ariana Grande the sound of her two latest mega-smashes is stepping into her own spotlight.\n\nA former child actress who now performs as Tayla Parx, above, contributes melodic and lyrical ideas to some of the biggest artists in the world, and those aspiring to be. Now 25, she's paying the same attention to her debut album.\n\nOur music critic also sat down with T Bone Burnett, another stay-busy-behind-the-scenes-musician. But every so often he returns with his own music, as he does this week with a new album. \"The Invisible Light: Acoustic Space,\" is the first of a planned trilogy.\n\n\n9. This was not the season anyone envisioned for the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nLeBron James ended the season on the bench with an injury. Magic Johnson, the team's president of basketball operations, quit. And the Lakers had a losing record. Our N.B.A. reporter explains why the team fell apart.\n\nAnd after 21 seasons as a Dallas Maverick, Dirk Nowitzki, above, will play his last game tonight. The league's sixth career leading scorer with 31,541 points, he is credited with ushering in the modern era of power-forward play.\n\n\n10. Finally, our family tree is growing.\n\nArchaeologists in the Philippines have turned up the bones of a previously unknown human species from at least 50,000 years ago.

I'm only getting started.'\n\nOminous words indeed for anyone who knows his antics from the previous seasons.\n\nHouse Of Cards, which is based on the superior BBC show of the same name, returns on March 4.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 14], "id": "Q3330940", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1055984", "Q1169273", "Q15731070", "Q16994341", "Q19364045",

We heard from people celebrating across the world, from pipers in Catalonia to rousing toasts in Montana. There was even a kilt spottd in Shanghai, albeit alongside a giant mechanical horse.\n\nFrom all the pictures and stories we received, certain themes emerged. Below, we list 10 signs you're probably at a Burns Night supper.\n\n1) You've dug out your best Saltire\n\n2) Kilts abound in your surroundings\n\nBurns Night in Helsinki\n\nAround 30 Scots gather in a pub, each bringing a contribution to the food table.\n\nEverything from Haggis to tablet, & a crate of Irn-Bru.\n\nFinishing the night off with a sing-along & poem recital.\n\n3) There's a piper lurking about somewhere\n\nBagpipes\n\nAbout 75 people gathered in the caveau of the abbey to drink (mostly the local red wine) and feast on haggis and sing \"On the bonnie banks of Lock Lomond.\"\n\n4) In fact, you're wearing your \"special occasion\" sporran\n\nWhat the fox?\n\nBurns night celebrations, one guest had a very unusual sporran!\n\n5) There is plenty of whisky available\n\n6) And, ahem, teacakes?\n\n7) You find yourself talking to offal\n\nByford Burns Night\n\nCelebrating Burns Night in Herefordshire with a large gathering of family. Pictured is my nephew, Greg performing the address to the haggis.\n\n8)... and scrabbling around for the collective noun for Haggis\n\nA twenty haggis Burns' night\n\nThis year we collected together haggises from all over Scotland (also two from Yorkshire and Wales) and made a few ourselves. After the piping in of the haggis, address to a haggis, poem recitals, there was big regional haggis tasting. Great fun.\n\n9) Finally, you settle down to your healthy meal...\n\n10)...

Police said the attack appeared to be criminal rather than terrorist. Witnesses said the gunman, dressed in black, fired indiscriminately after entering the Cafe Noir, in the centre of the city.\n\nThe gunman burst into the basement of the Tel Aviv Gay and Lesbian Association and sprayed the interior, where a support group for gay teenagers was being held, with automatic rifle fire. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said it was \"most likely a criminal attack and not a terror attack.\"\n\nPolice are searching the area for the gunman, who fled the scene, he said. Roadblocks were set up.\n\nRescue services said six of the wounded were badly hurt. \"This was a hate crime, a premeditated attack,\" witness Yaniv Weisman told Channel 10 TV. He said Cafe Noir, the basement club, was popular with youth.\n\n\"Those hurt were very young,\" he said.\n\nOpenly gay Knesset lawmaker Nitzan Horowitz said it was \"without a doubt the biggest ever attack on the Israeligay community, we are all in shock.\"\n\nWitnesses told Israeli media that the gunman was dressed all in black, and described the scene as a \"bloodbath.\"\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [20, 27], "id": "Q801", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1116961", "Q12020074", "Q12404065", "Q12410593", "Q1268267", "Q128480", "Q1462454", "Q1674688", "Q1674691", "Q1752440", "Q1851808", "Q191406", "Q2578249", "Q2620910", "Q2665847", "Q2696109", "Q2910156", "Q34216", "Q385334", "Q3858", "Q462211", "Q496254", "Q510534", "Q582706", "Q58967", "Q62458", "Q801", "Q8141", "Q869675", "Q875556"]}, {"span": [137, 144], "id": "Q801", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1116961", "Q12020074", "Q12404065", "Q12410593", "Q1268267", "Q128480", "Q1462454", "Q1674688", "Q1674691", "Q1752440", "Q1851808", "Q191406", "Q2578249", "Q2620910", "Q2665847", "Q2696109", "Q2910156", "Q34216", "Q385334", "Q3858", "Q462211", "Q496254", "Q510534", "Q582706", "Q58967", "Q62458", "Q801", "Q8141", "Q869675", "Q875556"]}, {"span": [153, 161], "id": "Q33935", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q12406444", "Q1389899", "Q181479", "Q192811", "Q206585", "Q223728", "Q2637357", "Q2905705", "Q2915697", "Q2916134", "Q299802", "Q319233", "Q319239", "Q33935", "Q3725327", "Q4578886", "Q53444085", "Q555356", "Q675901", "Q750948", "Q7695534", "Q7695556", "Q781491", "Q801", "Q950347"]}, {"span": [331, 340], "id": "<NIL>", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q6648761", "Q7460340"]}, {"span": [412, 448], "id": "<NIL>", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": []}, {"span": [575, 590], "id": "Q6838928", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q6838928"]}, {"span": [874, 887], "id": "<NIL>", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": []}, {"span": [893, 906], "id": "<NIL>", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": []}, {"span": [916, 925], "id": "<NIL>", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q6648761", "Q7460340"]}, {"span": [1022, 1029], "id": "Q133396", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q133396", "Q19879613", "Q2668563"]}, {"span": [1039, 1054], "id": "Q2916662", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q2916662"]}, {"span": [1115, 1125], "id": "<NIL>", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": []}, {"span": [1175, 1182], "id": "Q801", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1116961", "Q12020074", "Q12404065", "Q12410593", "Q1268267", "Q128480", "Q1462454", "Q1674688", "Q1674691", "Q1752440", "Q1851808", "Q191406", "Q2578249", "Q2620910", "Q2665847", "Q2696109", "Q2910156", "Q34216", "Q385334", "Q3858", "Q462211", "Q496254", "Q510534", "Q582706", "Q58967", "Q62458", "Q801", "Q8141", "Q869675", "Q875556"]}], "evaluation_span": [971, 1273], "labels": [{"id": 1, "span": [1022, 1029], "entity_id": "Q133396", "name": "Knesset", "type": "Q43229", "coref": false}, {"id": 2, "span": [1030, 1038], "entity_id": "Q4175034", "name": "legislator", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871", "coref": false}, {"id": 3, "span": [1039, 1054], "entity_id": "Q2916662", "name": "Nitzan Horowitz", "type": "Q215627", "coref": false}, {"id": 4, "span": [1115, 1122], "entity_id": "Q801", "name": "Israel", "type": "Q27096213|Q4164871|Q43229", "children": [5], "coref": false}, {"id": 5, "span": [1115, 1122], "entity_id": "Q875556", "name": "Israelis", "type": "Q33829", "parent": 4, "coref": false}, {"id": 6, "span": [1175, 1182], "entity_id": "Q801", "name": "Israel", "type": "Q27096213|Q4164871|Q43229", "children": [7], "coref": false}, {"id": 7, "span": [1175, 1182], "entity_id": "Q875556", "name": "Israelis", "type": "Q33829", "parent": 6, "coref": false}, {"id": 8, "span": [1198, 1204], "entity_id": "Q619851", "name": "gunfighter", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871", "coref": false}, {"id": 9, "span": [1224, 1229], "entity_id": "Q23445", "name": "black", "type": "Q1075", "coref": false}]}

{"id": 2011131453, "title": "20110811 - 2nd blast draws scrutiny to alternative-energy firms", "text": "2nd blast draws scrutiny to alternative-energy firms\n\nThe scenes were oddly similar.\n\nOn June 17, 2010, an explosion at a Simi Valley alternative energy company blew off part of the roof and caused parts of the building to collapse. Employee Tyson Larson, 28, was killed and two others injured.\n\nOn Tuesday, another explosion rocked an alternative energy company in Sylmar, tearing a hole in the roof and shattering windows of neighboring businesses. This time Timothy Larson, a veteran Los Angeles city firefighter who has been on disability leave for several years, was critically injured. Another employee was also injured.\n\nInvestigators are now looking into the connection between the two companies, both of which are owned by Timothy A. Larson, the father of the two men.\n\nIn Simi Valley, the company operated under the names Realm Catalyst Inc. and Realm Industries. An explosion at the company in 2008 blew out the garage door of one of its nearby offices, said Bill Nash, a spokesman for the Ventura County Fire Department.\n\nTwo years later, the massive fatal explosion forced firefighters to evacuate nearby areas and resulted in three citations totaling more than $5,600 after a California Division of Occupational Safety and Health investigation. Investigators said the company had used an air compressor and two pressure vessel tanks that it was not permitted to use, and that it used altered tanks in a way that were not \"good engineering practice\" and \"not in accordance with\" national standards.\n\nThe company was in the process of appealing the citations and a hearing was held Tuesday before an appeals board judge in Van Nuys, said Erika Monterroza, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Industrial Relations. She had not received a report on the results of the hearing as of Wednesday evening, she said.\n\nTuesday's explosion occurred while workers were transferring hydrogen gas from one cylinder to another, Monterroza said. Fire officials said the company was in the business of extracting hydrogen from water to create an alternative-fuel source.\n\nA few months after his death, Tyson Larson was granted a patent for a process he and a co-inventor named William A. Stehl said could create energy from water molecules by using an electrical circuit to create resonance in the molecule. The energy they created, they said, could be used to power motorized vehicles.\n\nStehl was indicted last year in U.S. District Court in northern New York on charges of selling investors on a similar process to create energy from water. The indictment alleged that Stehl and a co-defendant sold investors on the process but used the money for personal expenditures.\n\nThat case is ongoing and was scheduled to go to trial in September.\n\nThe California Division of Occupational Safety and Health has said it will investigate the latest blast. The Los Angeles Fire Department's arson/counter-terrorism section will also investigate.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [122, 133], "id": "Q323414", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by":

{"id": 2018648790, "title": "20180903 - Bankrupt man with 'sick' foot fetish caught filming girls as young as eight", "text": "Bankrupt man with 'sick' foot fetish caught filming girls as young as eight\n\nA bankrupt man with a foot fetish has avoided jail after he was caught filming girls as young as eight in an Aldi store.\n\nKristian Stephan, 38, filmed the legs and feet of young girls 'for his own sexual gratification' in the supermarket and in the city centre of Solihull, West Midlands, a court was told.\n\nHe was spotted by security guards after staff noticed him acting suspiciously and initially thought he was a shoplifter.\n\nStephan, of Aldridge, Walsall, swerved a jail sentence at Birmingham Magistrates' Court after pleading guilty to two counts of outraging public decency.\n\nHe was handed a three-year community order - the maximum length available.\n\nThe 38-year-old was first spotted acting suspiciously in Shirley's Aldi store on April 19 this year, the court heard.\n\nMagistrates were told staff initially suspected him of being a shoplifter. A PCSO was asked to watch him before staff spotted Stephan on CCTV 'filming a child of around 12 years of age from the waist down'.\n\nThe court heard the incident was reported to police but Stephan was not detained at the time.\n\nOn May 5, a security guard at Boots saw Stephan bending down near two girls aged around eight and 11, filming them from the waist down on his phone.\n\nDavid Devine, prosecuting, said: 'He approached Mr Stephan. The guard said he felt shocked and outraged as he has nieces of a similar age. He said he felt sickened by Mr Stephan's behaviour.'\n\nMagistrates were told the guard challenged Stephan, who told him he was doing 'nothing wrong' and he planned to 'delete the video anyway'.\n\nHe walked out of the store but was detained and arrested by police who had been called by Boots staff.\n\nMr Devine said Stephan admitted to both offences at police interview. He also admitted his motives.\n\n'He did it for his own sexual gratification. He told police he had a sexual fetish for feet and that he finds it hard to control his sexual needs.'\n\nFollowing the Boots incident, police carried out a search of Stephan's property and found a small quantity of cannabis in a plastic box. He also pleaded guilty to a charge of possession of the drug.\n\nStephan, who declined legal representation in court, told magistrates on Tuesday: 'I apologise sincerely. I am having counselling and just trying to change my life around.\n\n'I went bankrupt. That's not an excuse but I was in a rut. In a way, this thing that happened to me, it stopped me going out there again.'\n\nAppearing on Wednesday for sentencing he told magistrates hewas seeing a psychiatrist and working ten hours a day.\n\nHe said: 'It is horrendous what I did. I have never done anything like this before. I got myself into a horrendous rut. I have no excuse. There is no excuse for what I have done.'\n\nHe had no previous convictions and the court heard he was of previous good character.\n\nStephan said he did not have a solicitor because he did not want 'someone to make out I have done nothing wrong', but he challenged part of a pre-sentence report presented to the court.\n\n'The report says I am going to be a threat to society but I am not a threat to anyone. I have already promised many people this is not going to happen again,' he said.\n\nHe must complete a 60-day rehabilitation order, a 60-day programme to target sexual offending and 100 hours unpaid work.\n\nHe was ordered to pay court costs of \u00a3185 and an \u00a385 victim surcharge.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [186, 190], "id": "Q125054", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by":

There were large brown patches and chunks of the pitch frequently came loose.\n\nThe 69,000-seater stadium was only part-full as the top tier remained closed for the clash\n\nGoals from Branislav Ivanovic (centre) and substitute Yohan Mollo secured a 2-0 victory\n\nThe grass had to be replaced recently after turf on the first field died. Lack of light has been blamed because the stadium's roof has often been closed and the mechanism allowing the retractable field to be moved outside isn't in use. That had to be fixed recently after complaints it was making the entire field wobble.\n\nVisiting team Ural Yekaterinburg finished with just eight men as they were beaten 2-0 by Zenit St. Petersburg.\n\nThe stadium was only partly full because organizers decided not to open the top tier.\n\nUral's Roman Emelyanov hit the post in the 51st minute before the game changed when Eric Bicfalvi earned a second booking for what seemed to be a legitimate tackle. Enraged Ural striker Roman Pavlyuchenko confronted the referee and was also sent off.\n\nGround staff were forced to tend to the playing surface during Zenit's victory on Saturday\n\nThe ground will host the Confederations Cup final this year and a World Cup semi-final in 2018\n\nFormer Chelsea defender defender Branislav Ivanovic scored with a header in the 86th minute, swiftly followed by Ural's third red card - this time for Emelyanov after he and Zenit's Artyom Dzyuba shoved each other.\n\nSubstitute Yohan Mollo added a second goal for the hosts in stoppage time.\n\nDesigned to look like a spaceship on the shore of the Baltic Sea, the St. Petersburg Stadium will host the Confederations Cup final this year and a World Cup semifinal in 2018.\n\nShare or comment on this article\n",

{"id": 2020848425, "title": "20200821 - Homes in Blue Mountains most at risk from bushfires, insurer says", "text": "Homes in Blue Mountains most at risk from bushfires, insurer says\n\nLoading\n\n\"Bushfire risk is increasing across the country mainly due to higher temperatures coupled with lower humidity and higher evaporation rates,\" Mr Leplastrier said.\n\nAccording to IAG estimates, rebuilding a typical four-bedroom home in a high-risk bushfire area can cost more than $100,000 extra to meet upgraded bushfire standards.\n\nHomeowners may not be prepared for the costs of cleaning up if they are hit by fires. The average cost for removing debris is $46,000 per house, rising to $68,000 if asbestos is found, IAG estimated.\n\nRecent wet weather does not mean this season's fire risks have been eliminated. \"It may have been headed off, but it's still there,\" Mr Leplastrier said.\n\nThe 'Tutti Frutti' shop at Bilpin in the Blue Mountains goes up in flames in December 2019. A report says the public should get access to more information to understand what has worked and not worked during big bushfire events.\n\nCredit:Nick Moir\n\nLoading\n\nMeanwhile, the report by former firefighters said tackling long-term threats required greater transparency to identify what worked and didn't during major events.\n\nThe dozen, boasting a combined 400-plus years in roles at the NSW Parks and Wildlife Service and as volunteers in the Rural Fire Service, said Australia \"must do better in managing increasingly dangerous bushfires\" as the climate warms and dries.\n\nIan Brown, one of the members of the Independent Bushfire Group responsible for the 179-page report, said many issues \"were not getting talked about,\" even at the bushfire Royal Commission.\n\nIan Brown, one of the report's authors, in a part of the Blue Mountains National Park near Mount Victoria, which burnt because an RFS backburn got out of control.\n\nCredit:Janie Barrett\n\nThese include the general lack of research into the most effective ways to suppress a fire, how agencies decide which blazes get priority, the poor performance of fire-behaviour models, and the absence of objective post-fire analysis.\n\n\"Things are getting worse and we need to review what we're doing,\" said Mr Brown, who has helped fight more than 100 bushfires.\n\nThe report comes as the Berejiklian government prepares to release the results of the NSW Bushfire Inquiry report, possibly within days.\n\nThat report, by former deputy NSW Police commissioner Dave Owens and the chair of the Independent Planning Commission Mary O'Kane, is expected to detail the increasing bushfire risks from climate change and the efficacy of prescribed burning to moderate those threats.\n\nLoading\n\nMr Brown's group said more planned burns to reduce fuel loads may actually exacerbate fire risks.\n\nFor instance, burning usually moist forests when conditions permit can alter their species mix, making them more fire prone while reducing natural fire breaks in the landscape.\n\n\"Analysis of vegetation across the landscape shows that the North Coast region has only 33 per cent of 'treatable' vegetation [or planned burns],\" the report said. For the Sydney Basin, the share is about two-thirds, and just under half for the South Coast and Tablelands.\n\nAt least 20 homes were destroyed when the Mt Wilson backburn got away. A new report says specialist training is needed for teams conducting such potentially high-risk operations during the bushfire season.\n\nCredit:Nick Moir\n\nThe group also took aim at the so-called \"after action reviews,\" typically conducted by the RFS.\n\n\"There is no public reporting, independent expert advice, objective research or outside oversight,\" the report said. \"Fire controllers report on fires they themselves have managed.\"\n\nUnlike for similar government functions such as the police and the military, the RFS \"is both the lead agency and also the chief reporter to government on outcomes,\" it said.\n\nIn need of some good news?\n\nStories that will brighten your outlook, delivered weekly to your inbox.

One person who won't be there: Hudson. \"Kate was invited, but she's not going to come,\" says a Koi source.\n\nNo \"Oprah\" for K-Fed\nSince just about anything is possible when it comes to Britney Spears and Kevin Federline, it didn't appear entirely out of the realm of possibility that K-Fed could be making an appearance on \"Oprah,\" as was reported Monday.\n\n\"Not true,\" says Federline's rep, setting the record straight shortly after the news broke. Federline has remained mostly out of the spotlight since he and Spears announced their split last November. This is in stark contrast to his ex, who was spotted shopping for chandeliers on Sunday, while kids Jayden and Preston stayed behind in the car along with the court-appointed parenting coach.\n\nWhat's Federline up to? For starters, he is not working on a follow-up album to \"Playing With Fire.\" Recently he filmed a guest spot on the CW's \"One Tree Hill.\" According to his rep, the air date for that episode has not yet been announced.\n\nBarbara Walters offers glimpse into Sir Paul's life\nAdd Barbara Walters to the list of people who aren't fond of Heather Mills. During Monday's taping of \"The View,\" Walters, who rarely disparages her interview subjects, told the audience that she's interviewed Mills twice and during one of the interviews, Mills went so far as to complain about the temperature of the water she was given, and that \"she was extremely difficult. ... She was so impossible to our producers.\"\n\nEarth to Heather: You don't have many people in your corner. Don't you think it's time to settle this once and for all?\n\n\u00a9 2007 MSNBC Interactive\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 11], "id": "Q169946", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by":

The prime minister and cabinet continued to stand by him on Thursday.\n\nAs part of their inquiry, detectives examined the aide's press conference on Monday, where he repeatedly said that he had done nothing wrong, and concluded he probably did.\n\nPolice stopped short of a definitive declaration of rule-breaking because lockdown regulations had not been tested in the courts, sources with knowledge of the force's thinking told the Guardian.

{"id": 20171788343, "title": "20170531 - Cardiff 0-2 Newcastle: Match report", "text": "Cardiff 0-2 Newcastle: Match report\n\nA week in which Newcastle United had experienced the highs of Premier League promotion and the lows of a HMRC raid ended with a win in Wales last night.\n\nNewcastle's stars have had an unusual five days, to say the least, but they did their job in Cardiff with two super second-half strikes from Christian Atsu and Isaac Hayden.\n\nIt means there is still an outside chance of Newcastle claiming the Championship title if Brighton blink. It is unlikely but Rafa Benitez believes it can be done.\n\nShare this article\n\nShare\n\n18 shares\n\n\"You never know,\" said Benitez, who will not watch Brighton's game against Bristol City today. \"We did our job. We can do nothing now. It's depending on them. We have to wait.\n\n\"Maybe someone will call me (after the Brighton match) and say, \"They did this, they did that.\" Fine. No problem.\"\n\nA win for Brighton at the Amex Stadium today would confirm them as champions and all Newcastle could do was put pressure on their opponents. They did so, despite the distractions of this week.\n\n\nNewcastle: Elliot, Clark, Dummett, Mbemba, Yedlin, Colback (Shelvey 73), Hayden, Diame, Perez (Sterry 90), Atsu, Murphy (Mitrovic 66)\n\nGoalscorers: Atsu 55, Hayden 65\n\nCardiff: McGregor, Bennett, Morrison, Ecuele Manga, Richards, Whittingham (Pilkington 64), Halford (Ralls 64), Gunnarsson, Harris (Noone 24), Zohore, Hoilett\n\nBookings: Richards\n\nThe players\" preparations for this trip to Cardiff were not helped by the sight of officers searching their training ground in Benton on Wednesday.\n\nThat followed the news that Newcastle managing director Lee Charnley had been arrested at his home at 6am, before later being released without charge.\n\nCharnley usually attends Newcastle matches but was absent at the Cardiff City Stadium. Had he been here, he would have seen Benitez's squad put on a professional performance.\n\nAsked about this week, Benitez said: \"The reaction of the players, especially after the promotion on Monday, we gave them Tuesday off, and it's always more difficult to control what they do.\n\nChampionship\n\nPremier League\n\nChampionship\n\nLeague One\n\nLeague Two\n\nScottish Premiership\n\nScottish Div 1\n\nScottish Div 2\n\nScottish Div 3\n\nLigue 1\n\nSerie A\n\nLa Liga\n\nBundesliga\n\n\"During the week they were training well. I think they were quite focussed.\"\n\nMore than 4,000 away fans made the 600-mile round-trip to Cardiff. They refused to allow a HMRC raid to ruin their promotion party and so did the players.\n\nIt was Cardiff who looked the likelier to open the scoring in the first half, however.\n\nThey thought they had in the 20th minute, when Sean Morrison headed home Peter Whittingham's corner. Referee Graham Scott spotted an infringement, however, and ruled it out.\n\nIt left Neil Warnock unhappy as the Cardiff boss took aim at PGMOL chief Mike Riley as well as Scott.\n\n\"I thought he was very, very poor in general,\" Warnock said. \"His positioning and interpretation.\n\n\" (Aleksandar) Mitrovic comes on, never looks at the ball three times, he looks at Morrison, it's a foul every time and he never sees it.\n\n\"Why? Because he's not educated. It's no wonder if Mike Riley is his tutor. It's no wonder.\"\n\nNewcastle started the second half on top and a free-kick from 20 yards gave Atsu the perfect opportunity to make his mark. He did so.\n\nWith a fine finish, Atsu put the ball over the wall and beyond McGregor, who did not attempt to dive. \"The Mags are going up,\" was the song from Newcastle's supporters.\n\nSoon after, it was 2-0. A fine strike by Hayden from 25 yards saw him smash the ball into the bottom corner, and that was that.\n\nGetting back to business on the pitch was what Newcastle needed after a tumultuous week off it and the players did not let Benitez down. Now, they need Bristol City do them a favour at Brighton today.\n\nHayden's goal was Newcastle's second in ten minutes and put the Friday night game to bed\n\nShare this article\n\nShare\n\n18

It's more thrilling than it sounds.\n\n\nOne night, after making this terrifically simple Melissa Clark ginger-scallion chicken dish for dinner, I eyed the leftover hairy scallion butts, laying discarded near the cutting board. On a whim, I arranged them roots-down in a jelly jar with a little bit of water. By the next morning, they were happily back on their way, a tender, alive thing, stretching toward the light.\n\nSince then, checking on my scallions has become my favorite daily activity, the way taking a walk to get a coffee or picking up the mail used to be. I grew up in Virginia, helping out in my mother's garden, and I know that we can regrow most of our everyday food: potatoes, ginger, celery, even carrot tops. Usually, it's not terribly helpful knowledge in my Brooklyn kitchen, with each precious foot of counter space already overcrowded and accounted for.\n\nBut there's nothing like a viral pandemic to inspire resourcefulness, especially when food feels so expensive and each trip to the store is laden with anxiety and fear. The Covid-19 crisis is asking us to reconsider so many things: Our relationship to wellness, our priorities, our values. Everything suddenly feels precious, and nothing should be wasted - time, energy, even food scraps. Maximizing every resource we have feels productive and reassuring, when little else does. It's free comfort, and we shouldn't squander that, either.\n\nThe green of my second-generation scallions is fainter somehow, and they taste gentler, too. They're easier on the palette and my stressed-out stomach. The milky shoots remind me of a line from the poem \"Sorrow Is Not My Name,\" by Ross Gay, that reads: \"My color's green. I'm spring.\"\n\nSpring, the season of renewal, is on hold. And for now, summer is too. Outside my home, there is little to no certainty. But my scallions? Each day, they rebound a little more, oblivious to anything else but growth.\n\nJenna Wortham is a staff writer for the NYT Magazine and co-host of \"Still Processing.\" She is the co-editor of the forthcoming visual anthology \"Black Futures,\" due out from One World in 2020.\n\nDoodles by Shannon Lin and Jonathan Corum.

It marked a sudden fall from grace for the royal consort, who for several years was seen often at the side of King Vajiralongkorn.\n\nEven after the king's marriage to Queen Suthida, Sineenart was a regular guest at royal events.\n\nWhat did the palace say?\n\nThe statement published on Monday said Sineenat had \"shown resistance and pressure in every manner to stop the appointment of the Queen\" ahead of the coronation in May.\n\n\"The king gave her a royal consort position, in hopes of relieving the pressure and a problem that could affect the monarchy,\" the statement said.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption King Vajiralongkorn and his consort pose at the Grand Palace in Bangkok\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Sineenat had held the military rank of major general\n\nIt also accused the royal consort of \"resistance against the king and the queen\" and of abusing her power to give orders on the king's behalf.\n\nThe king, the statement said, had learnt \"she neither was grateful to the title bestowed upon her, nor did she behave appropriately according to her status.\"\n\nHe ordered her stripped of all royal titles, decorations, status in the royal guard and her military ranks.\n\nKing Vajiralongkorn ascended the throne after the death of his father in 2016.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device\n\nMedia captionThe king is seen pouring sacred water on the head of Queen Suthida when they were married in May\n\nWhat about the king's wives?\n\nHe has had four wives - Princess Soamsawali from 1977 to 1993; Yuvadhida Polpraserth from 1994 to 1996; Srirasmi Suwadee between 2001 and 2014; and Queen Suthida.\n\nThe true cause of Sineenart's removal as royal consort may never be made public, given the secrecy which cloaks palace affairs in Thailand. The nation's lese-majeste law forbids any insult of the monarchy and is among the strictest in the world.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device\n\nMedia captionSasiwimon was jailed in 2015 for insulting Thailand's monarchy\n\nThe removal of Sineenat echoes the cases of two of the King's former wives. In 1996, he denounced his second wife, who fled to the United States, and disowned four sons he had with her.\n\nIn 2014, his third wife Srirasmi Suwadee was similarly stripped of all her titles and banished from court. Her 14-year-old son has been raised by King Vajiralongkorn in Germany and Switzerland.\n\nThe King has also exercised his royal powers in a more direct way than his recent predecessors. Earlier this month, the two most important army units in the capital, Bangkok were placed directly under his command - a concentration of military power in royal hands unprecedented in modern Thailand.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 4], "id": "Q869", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1209722", "Q1293283", "Q1347711", "Q1354367", "Q1787389",

{"id": 2016289541, "title": "20161221 - Earth's temperature to dip but still sizzle in 2017", "text": "Earth's temperature to dip but still sizzle in 2017\n\nOSLO World temperatures are likely to dip next year from a sizzling record high in 2016, when man-made global warming was slightly boosted by a natural El Nino event in the Pacific Ocean, scientists said on Tuesday.\n\nIt is still likely to be the third warmest since records began.\n\nThe year-on-year decline will coincide with the first year of Donald Trump's presidency. He has sometimes dismissed as a hoax the idea that global warming is caused by human activity.\n\n\"Next year is not likely to be a record but it will still be a very warm year,\" Professor Adam Scaife of the British Met Office told Reuters of a report on Tuesday based on new computer data.\n\nHe said it would be wrong for anyone who doubts that climate change is caused by humans to interpret the expected 2017 dip, prompted by the end of El Nino, which released heat from the Pacific Ocean, as a sign of an end to the long-term trend of global warming.\n\nThe Met Office projected that 2017 was likely to be the third warmest year since records began in the mid-19th century, behind 2016 and 2015.\n\nAmong signs of warming, sea ice in both the Arctic Ocean and around Antarctica is at record lows, according to mid-December data by the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center.\n\nGlobal average temperatures for 2017 would be about 0.75 degree Celsius (1.35 Fahrenheit) above the long-term 1961-1990 average of 14.0 C (57.2 F), the Met Office said.\n\nThis year is so far 0.86 C (1.55 F) above average, matching a forecast made in 2016, Scaife said. El Nino accounted for about 0.2 C (0.36 F) of the warming in 2016, far less than the extra heat from human-generated greenhouse gases.\n\nSeparately, the Geneva-based World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said 2016 was on track to be the warmest on record, ahead of 2015, with data from November confirming projections issued a month ago.\n\n\"2016 has been remarkable for all the wrong reasons,\" WMO spokeswoman Clare Nullis said of the heat.\n\nThe WMO says the build-up of human-created greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is causing ever more harmful heatwaves, droughts, floods and a rise in global sea levels of about 20 cm (7.87 inches) in the past century.\n\nEl Ninos happen every few years and can disrupt weather worldwide. After a powerful El Nino in 1998, it took until 2005 for a year to match that year's record heat.\n\n(With extra reporting by Stephanie Nebehay in Geneva, Nina Chestney in London Editing by Jeremy

{"id": 2014238098, "title": "20140717 - Review of The Divide on WeTV", "text": "Review of The Divide on WeTV\n\nMarin Ireland in The Divide. WE\n\nIt's generally a good thing for a new series to introduce itself with a clear, simple title, but in the case of The Divide, the first scripted drama from WeTV, the title makes it seem much more simple than it is. The eight-episode legal drama is, in brief, about a controversial effort to reopen the death-penalty convictions of two white prisoners in the murder of a black family. You might assume, then, that the show is about a single, sharp, unambiguous divide between white Americans and black Americans in the justice system-the law-drama equivalent of Crash.\n\nBut to its credit, and like the case it begins to explore in its two-hour premiere Wednesday night, The Divide is much more complicated than it seems. Yes, there is a racial divide at the center of the show: Christine Rosa (Marin Ireland), an advocate for a Philadelphia group based on the Innocence Project, and most of her colleagues working to overturn what they believe to be wrongful convictions, are white. District attorney Adam Page (Damon Gupton), his police-commissioner father (Clarke Peters) and the surviving daughter of the victims are black.\n\nAs the case unfolds, however, it becomes clear that neither side of this (purposely unsettled) case has a monopoly on righteousness or ethical conflict. Christine and Adam are each driven, if to different ends, and each is vulnerable to being blinded by their determination and external motivations. (He's politically ambitious; her father is in jail for a crime she knows he's innocent of because she was with him when it happened.)\n\nThe divides that emerge in this series are not simply between two races but between prosecution and defense, between the desire for justice and for resolution. In the two-hour premiere, we get to see multiple sides of each character, including the inmates-who, the script suggests, may be innocent, may be guilty, may be innocent of this crime yet bad people in other ways. There's a remarkable scene between one convict (Chris Bauer) and his mother (Ann Dowd) before his scheduled last meal, for which he requested a brand of hot dogs he used to hate when she served them when he was a kid-it packs a while life's history of mutual blame and sorrow into a few brief minutes.\n\nThere's a certain amount of melodrama in the premiere (which is all that was previewed for critics), but the beginning fits a fair amount of nuance into a package that could have been a soapbox. Ireland in particular gives Christine fine shading, and the way that race plays into the story-and into Adam's career ambitions-feels more natural than engineered. The Divide provides a good head start on a fall network season that's unusually diverse in its casting; if The Divide continues the way it started, it will set an example of how to tell stories of black and white (and brown, and yellow...) in shades of gray.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [10, 20], "id": "<NIL>", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1203182",

The new restrictions will cover around 1.5 million people, nearly half the country's population. Wales's health minister Vaughan Gething urged people not to have a \"big blowout\" ahead of the introduction of the new restrictions.\n\nScotland saw a daily record number of cases on Friday with a total of 558 people testing positive for Covid-19 in 24 hours.\n\nRead more\n\nPositive cases jumped by an estimated 60 per cent in England in one week, according to a survey from the Office for National Statistics. The survey also found an estimated 103,600 people had the virus in the week from 13-19 September.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK's largest supermarket chain began rationing key items in an effort to prevent a return to shortages seen during the early stage of the pandemic.\n\nTesco has introduced a three-item per customer limit on flour, dried pasta, toilet roll, baby wipes and anti-bacterial wipes, a measure the supermarket chain said was to \"ensure everyone can keep buying what they need.\" Morrisons had introduced similar rationing measures on Thursday.\n\nA new phase three trial for a vaccine was launched by US biotech company Novavax, the second trial to reach phase three in the UK.\n\nTen thousand people will be invited to take part in the new phase at locations including London,

The Georgian section of the pipeline runs within 34 miles of South Ossetia, controlled by Russia since regional conflict erupted 10 years ago.\n\nFor natural gas, the first phase of deliveries from the Shah Deniz field off the coast of Azerbaijan, heralded as BP's largest gas discovery when it was announced in 1999, moved through Georgia and Turkey in 2006. The second phase will push gas through a network of pipelines dubbed the Southern Gas Corridor deep into southern Europe.\n\nEurope gets about a quarter of its gas needs met by Russia, though most of that runs through the Soviet-era transit network in Ukraine, where geopolitical conflicts present a risk to energy security. The broader Southern Corridor is in a race against plans by Russian energy company Gazprom to twin the Nord Stream gas pipeline through the Baltic Sea to Germany.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0,

Designers in Japan are.\n\nCarmaker Nissan Motor is using a specialized driver's suit and goggles to simulate the bad balance, stiff joints, weaker eyesight and extra 11lbs that may accompany senior citizenry.\n\nAssociate chief designer Etsuhiro Watanabe says the suit's weight and constriction help in determining functionality and accessibility within cars by putting young designers not only in the minds of the mobility-challenged, but also in their bodies.\n\n\"Difficulty in walking, back pains, trouble in lifting arms - we wanted to consider assorted infirmities,\" said Watanabe of the concept known as universal design.\n\n\"It's easy to do this for the young, but we wanted to design for adverse conditions and see what modifications are needed.\"\n\nAn ageing suit was first used by Nissan a decade ago, while Japanese washlet maker Toto uses such suits to simulate bathroom mobility, even including tub water as part of the program.\n\nLaunched in a rapidly graying nation where over 40 percent of the population is expected to be over 65 age by mid-century, the design strategy also aims to find traction abroad.\n\nOver 40 percent of Nissan's Japanese and U.S. sales are to customers over 50 years old, according to the company.\n\nNissan says the suit and glasses help decide dashboard angles and visibility issues, as well as driver space and support.\n\n\"It's very difficult to drive, says Nissan's Naoki Yamamoto after a turn at the wheel in a suit that runs from neck to feet.\n\n\"You lose the freedom you're accustomed to, and while you can move, there are limitations, such as turning the steering wheel or switching on the blinker.\"\n\nUniversal design is not just for the elderly, as larger drivers with space and mobility concerns also look for greater access and share of the road.\n\nCopyright 2008 Reuters.

Rain, hail or shine? Not exactly\n\nThey say you can play football in all weather but that's not exactly true, is it? A waterlogged Suncorp Stadium turned into a giant kiddy pool during the second half of the Brisbane Roar-Wellington Phoenix match. True, Matt McKay and the Brisbane Roar players, plus coach Frans Thijssen, wanted to play on and who could blame them? With 15 minutes plus stoppage time still to go, they sensed an equaliser. Brisbane desperately needed points to keep pace with Melbourne City in the race for sixth spot and were fuming at being denied. However, it was clearly unsafe for players and images shown 30 minutes later showed the ground had become almost wholly submerged.\n\n2. More kids please, Popa\n\nI'm probably in the minority here but I was pleased to see so many youngsters getting their chance for the Western Sydney Wanderers on Saturday. They were overwhelmed by Newcastle but these next few weeks marks a great chance for Tony Popovic to blood so many young players on the big stage. Very few managers ever get that luxury but the well-documented fixture troubles mean he can expose some big talents to the senior tier and see if they're up to it. Besides, if any team needs to find some hidden gems before next season, it's the Wanderers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Glory close but deeper flaws are being exposed\n\nIt all depends on whether your glass is half-empty or half-full - either Perth Glory are getting their slump out of the way at the right time or they've hit the wall. And you might feel the Glory were stiff to have conceded an injury-time equaliser against Central Coast but they were perhaps fortunate to have led given the hosts had the better of the day. The good news for the Glory is that they've got the best run home of the \"big five,\" starting with matches against Western Sydney and Newcastle. They then host Sydney FC and Melbourne City on home soil and finish with the Wanderers away. If they can't find form in that stretch, they don't deserve to be there.\n\n4. Class factor matters\n\nThis may not go down with Melbourne Victory fans but Gui Finkler seems off his game. The Brazilian was buzzing around earlier in the year like a man possessed, relishing being given the reins as the team's leading attacking midfielder. However, he's lost his way somewhat in terms of setting up the play around him. That said, it was his pass that led to Archie Thompson's equaliser, which shows his touch hasn't completely deserted him. Aaron Mooy also had a surprisingly quiet night on Friday but it was his vision which set James Brown away for the winner. Moral of the story? Never discount individual brilliance (just ask anyone who tried to stop Nathan Burns).\n\n5. Where the bloody hell are you?\n\nJust 11,638 turned out to see Sydney FC try to go to the top of the table on Friday. Then we're down to 10,000 at Wanderland on Saturday and only 5000 at Gosford on Sunday. They barely managed to tick into five figures in Brisbane (although they had a good reason in hindsight). There's so many excuses being bandied about it's hard to keep pace. Is going to the game a bit too hard these days? Kudos to the fans in Adelaide, however. Their primal hatred of Victorians knows no bounds and over 16,000 saw Hindmarsh packed with passion. A small army of 1200 marched across from Melbourne, helping create one of the fiercest atmospheres we've seen this season.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [27, 59], "id": "<NIL>", "recognized_by":

{"id": 201015839, "title": "20100329 - Modest Rise in Consumer Spending in February", "text": "Modest Rise in Consumer Spending in February\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Consumers spent modestly last month, a sign that the economic recovery is proceeding at a decent - but not spectacular - pace.\n\nThe government said Monday that consumers increased their spending 0.3 percent in February, a tad slower than the 0.4 percent increase in January. Still, the increase was considered a respectable showing, especially given the snowstorms that slammed the East Coast.\n\nAmericans\" incomes, however, were flat.\n\nIncomes were flat in February, following a 0.3 percent gain in January. It marked the weakest showing since July, when incomes actually shrank. Income growth is the fuel for future spending. February's flat-line reading suggests shoppers will be cautious in the months ahead.\n\nSpending growth in February matched economists\" expectations. The reading on income was a bit weaker than forecast.\n\nBoth the spending and income figures in Monday's report point to a modest economic recovery.\n\nMany analysts predict the economy slowed in the first three months after logging a big growth spurt at the end of 2009.\n\nThe economy will expand at a 2.5 percent to 3 percent pace in the first quarter, analysts predict. That is roughly half the 5.6 percent pace seen in the final quarter of last year.\n\nUnlike past recoveries, where consumer spending led the way, this one is hinging more on the spending of businesses and foreigners.\n\nHigh unemployment, sluggish wage gains, hard-to-get credit and record-high home foreclosures are all expected to keep consumers relatively cautious - one of the main reasons why the pace of the recovery will be more subdued than in the past.\n\nWith spending outpacing income growth, Americans\" savings dipped in February.\n\nAmericans saved 3.1 percent of their disposable income, down from 3.4 percent in January. It was the lowest reading on the savings rate since October 2008.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [46, 56], "id": "Q61", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1018448", "Q1026008", "Q1088831", "Q1223", "Q166186", "Q1999182", "Q212654", "Q219563", "Q23", "Q2446223", "Q2555815", "Q263418", "Q484538", "Q48525", "Q485408", "Q489571", "Q495037", "Q496486", "Q497200", "Q501559", "Q511164", "Q550397", "Q56149", "Q594697", "Q61", "Q61148", "Q761885", "Q79281", "Q7971948", "Q7971960"]}, {"span": [58, 60], "id": "Q40469", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1159", "Q1247890", "Q16001327", "Q180311", "Q190219", "Q2268417", "Q244150", "Q250058", "Q2684311", "Q2838243", "Q321014", "Q326717", "Q3400773", "Q348125", "Q3625678", "Q379676", "Q40469", "Q410203", "Q4653445", "Q4653456", "Q4686251", "Q4794947", "Q4826716", "Q488415", "Q500716", "Q532", "Q5637340", "Q599149", "Q616386", "Q868534"]}, {"span": [446, 456], "id": "Q4268", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1046126", "Q118863", "Q1189650", "Q1277782", "Q1340296", "Q140246", "Q1901211", "Q2091502", "Q233467", "Q24460", "Q246972", "Q2785106", "Q30603068", "Q3347918", "Q3521764", "Q4268", "Q48006", "Q5138298", "Q5138395", "Q5328100", "Q5328102", "Q5328107", "Q5328118", "Q5328141", "Q5330590", "Q5330629", "Q672271", "Q876171", "Q941023", "Q9759"]}, {"span": [459, 468], "id": "Q30", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q11211", "Q11883242", "Q1365374", "Q1389353", "Q139750", "Q147927", "Q15133865", "Q16056052", "Q1640548", "Q164134", "Q1965974", "Q2299158", "Q244847", "Q2654269", "Q30", "Q3172032", "Q36747", "Q4745454", "Q4745632", "Q4745634", "Q49085", "Q4916593", "Q54122", "Q7892320", "Q7892341", "Q7892600", "Q828", "Q846570", "Q913651", "Q9212"]}, {"span": [1706, 1715], "id": "Q30", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q11211", "Q11883242", "Q1365374", "Q1389353", "Q139750", "Q147927", "Q15133865", "Q16056052", "Q1640548", "Q164134", "Q1965974", "Q2299158", "Q244847", "Q2654269", "Q30", "Q3172032", "Q36747", "Q4745454", "Q4745632", "Q4745634", "Q49085", "Q4916593", "Q54122", "Q7892320", "Q7892341", "Q7892600", "Q828", "Q846570", "Q913651", "Q9212"]}, {"span": [1746, 1755], "id": "Q30", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q11211", "Q11883242", "Q1365374", "Q1389353", "Q139750", "Q147927", "Q15133865", "Q16056052", "Q1640548", "Q164134", "Q1965974", "Q2299158", "Q244847", "Q2654269", "Q30", "Q3172032", "Q36747", "Q4745454", "Q4745632", "Q4745634", "Q49085", "Q4916593", "Q54122", "Q7892320", "Q7892341", "Q7892600", "Q828", "Q846570", "Q913651", "Q9212"]}], "evaluation_span": [1109, 1665], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [1138, 1141], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY", "coref": false}, {"id": 1, "span": [1153, 1154], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY", "coref": false}, {"id": 2, "span": [1175, 1180], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY", "coref": false}, {"id": 3, "span": [1190, 1198], "entity_id": "Q485178", "name": "analyst", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871", "coref": false}, {"id": 4, "span": [1233, 1236], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY", "coref": false}, {"id": 5, "span": [1279, 1288], "entity_id": "DATETIME", "name": "Unknown", "type": "DATETIME", "coref": false}, {"id": 6, "span": [1321, 1329], "entity_id": "Q22855", "name": "consumer", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871", "coref": false}, {"id": 7, "span": [1542, 1551], "entity_id": "Q22855", "name": "consumer", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871", "coref": false}, {"id": 8, "span": [1574, 1577], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY", "coref": false}]}

Shanghai Film already operates three Chinese Imax theatres.\n\nBox office revenues in China surged 27 percent last year to $3.6 billion, making the country a crucial market for international film

Extinction,\" the latest instalment of Michael Bay's blockbuster robot film franchise, earned nearly $10 million at Chinese Imax screens on its opening weekend, more than double the previous record, the company said.\n\nThe deal comes a year after Imax partnered with another Chinese company, Wanda Cinema, to open up to 120 of the Canadian company's theatres.\n\nAt the end of 2013, Imax had 173 cinemas in China and plans for 230 more by 2021, according to its latest annual report.\n\nThat puts China on track to become Imax's No. 1 market globally, overtaking the United States, where box

I just know that I don't want to go home.\"\n\nEarlier, she had said she hoped the show would help correct the public image of her, saying: \"I wanted to come on Dancing With The Stars to show people exactly who I am. And just prove to my son that I can be Super Muva.\"\n\nAmber and Maksim dressed as Khaleesi and Khal Drogo for their dramatic dance number on Monday, with Amber sporting a platinum blond wig covering her signature shaven head.\n\nReceiving a disappointing field of sixes from the judges, host Tom Bergeron admitted: 'I was surprised they didn't go a little higher.'\n\nTuesday's elimination was narrowed down to between shamed Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte, 32, and former child star Jake Austin, 21 - before Jake was sent home.\n\nOlympic gymnast Laurie Hernandez, 16, was the first to be told she was safe, coming as no surprise given that she was top of the leaderboard with a combined score of 63 from her first two dances.\n\nShe had insisted it had been a dream to be on the show since she was \"a little kid,\" saying: \"Now that I've got my gold medal I'm ready to get the mirrorball.\"\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 10], "id": "Q4741266", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by":

{"id": 2020571434, "title": "20201201 - Fijian British army veterans in high court battle to remain in UK", "text": "Fijian British army veterans in high court battle to remain in UK\n\nEight Fiji-born soldiers who served with the British army in Iraq and Afghanistan have gone to the high court to try to overturn what they say were bureaucratic errors that have left them as illegal immigrants in the country they once served.\n\nThey include Remesio \"Pat\" Waqaliva, 42, who was suddenly discharged from the army in 2009 after nine years, including two tours of Iraq, and not advised that he had to immediately apply for the UK citizenship to which he was legally entitled.\n\nWaqaliva, who was married and has four children, discovered subsequently that he was unable to work and has had to rely on handouts to survive. Without an income, he says, he has been unable to save up the \u00a32,389 plus lawyer's fees for a visa.\n\n\"I didn't have any time to prepare myself,\" Waqaliva said in his first interview. \"I wasn't told that my UK visa would expire when I left the army. Once I did realise, I just didn't have the money. It's not just the \u00a32,000, it's that I would have to hire a solicitor as well.\"\n\nThe British army recruits actively from Fiji. Recruits from the Pacific nation currently number about 1,300, and they are often noted for their commitment and bravery.\n\nThose who serve more than four years without serious blemish are entitled to live and work in the UK, but most of the veterans had assumed the process was automatic and have struggled with the paperwork as well as the fees involved.\n\nInstead they have found themselves unable to resolve their immigration status. Some returned to their native country but a group has come together to seek a judicial review of the handling of their cases in a crowdfunded action.\n\nOthers in the group include Taitusi Ratucaucau, who is recovering from an operation to remove a brain tumour that could cost him \u00a350,000 if he loses the case.\n\nWaqaliva was discharged after he had nearly completed a short period at the army correction centre in Colchester because he had overstayed his leave. He said he had family problems, which he was trying to fix, and thought having served his penalty that would be the end of the matter.\n\nBut Waqaliva was surprised to discover he had been told to leave the army with one week's notice. Family friends said the only money he was given was for a train ticket from Colchester to Wales, where his family were.\n\nThe veteran served with the 20th Armoured Brigade, and undertook tours of Iraq in 2006, and again just before he was discharged. The first tour was particularly dangerous: \"Every day you got out of the camp, you wouldn't know if you would come back alive.\"\n\nWaqaliva said he hoped the legal hearing, which begins on Tuesday, would help get his immigration status resolved. \"I think the first thing is to get a visa. That would put everything to rest, the stress the worry.\"\n\nMinisters have allowed several hundred Afghan interpreters who worked with the British in Helmand province to relocate to the UK. The scheme initially let in 450 but was recently expanded to allow in a further 100 at risk of reprisals from the Taliban.\n\nA government spokesperson said: \"The Home Office and Ministry of Defence work closely with our foreign and Commonwealth recruits to make sure they are fully aware of how they and their families can settle in the UK, and the costs involved.\"\n", "entity_mentions":

{"id": 20171094790, "title": "20170328 - Cynthia Erivo makes an expression at Oscars party", "text": "Cynthia Erivo makes an expression at Oscars party\n\nDirector Barry Jenkins, who shared a best adapted screenplay Oscar with co-writer Tarell Alvin McCraney for the - eventual - best film victor, Moonlight.\n\nJenkins has several projects on the go at the moment, including a television adaptation of Colson Whitehead's novel Underground Railroad, about Cora, an American slave on the run from a slave\u2011catcher whose accomplice wears a necklace made from human ears.\n\nI first saw an unfinished cut of Moonlight last July, and a completed version at the Telluride Film Festival in late August.\n\nI saw Damien Chazelle's La La Land early, too, and caught it again at Telluride. Regular readers of this space will know that I loved both movies.\n\nJenkins described the situation on stage at the Dolby Theatre after the screw-up over the best picture Oscar as a \"gorgeous\" mess. The actor Andrew Garfield put his finger on it, calling the mingling of La La Land and Moonlight \"symbolic and poetic.\"\n\nThe La La Land producers behaved with uncommon good grace in handing over the statuettes to Moonlight producers Adele Romanski and Jeremy Kleiner.\n\nI bumped into Hal Luftig in New York. He was one of the lead producers of the musical Kinky Boots and he told me that if he'd been in a similar situation he wouldn't have given up the statuette. \"They'd have had to wrestle me to the ground to get my Olivier or Tony,\" he said. And he was not joking.\n\n\"In future, at these awards shows, they'll have to give out confirmation cards that we flash to an audience so there's no misunderstanding,\" Luftig added.\n\nWell, that's what he said. But in the moment, I think something else kicks in. A sense of honour, one would hope.\n\nLook, it's just showbusiness! But I bet more people now know about, and will go to see, Moonlight than if it had been a \"regular\" win.\n\nAnd I hope folk who have dissed La La Land will go back and see it again, too. There's more to it than meets the eye; and Emma Stone deserved her win.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 13], "id": "Q21592474", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates":

For example, do you need to be near a beach for families.'\n\nAnd he added: 'The downside of buying on the coast is that it is going to be more expensive, you could pay a third of the price a few miles inland. So it is worth taking a look at different areas.'\n\nBuying agent Henry Pryor suggests that having a place abroad ahead of Brexit may prove a shrewd investment.\n\nBut he also adds a warning, saying: 'Historically places at the end of a Ryanair route have proved popular and lucrative investment areas - Perugia in Italy for example and similar secondary airports in Greece and Montenegro have similar appeal but be wary that post Brexit the airline routes may shift so don't bet the house on one carrier.\n\n'Remember that if you plan to rent out your property then guests demand top services but if you provide them the evidence suggests that they will pay for them.\n\n'Don't cut corners, keep some authenticity and make sure that your a accommodation is flexible - works for families with babies, house parties and increasingly importantly for silver stayers who have time and money for the best places.'\n\nAnd finally he added: 'Above all, buy something you want to use. After all, if it doesn't let and you can't sell it then you may end up living in it.'\n\nShare this article\n\nShare\n\n27 shares\n\n\nWe've selected eight properties around the world, from but can

{"id": 20172921747, "title": "20170817 - Army Redundancies: Will it be the brightest and best who volunteer?", "text": "Army Redundancies: Will it be the brightest and best who volunteer?\n\nBy Allan Mallinson for the Daily Mail\n\n\nI can still remember an undergraduate lecture by that fine economic historian Duncan Bythell, who could out-Bowra Bowra himself in Wadham waspishness, in which he quoted Harold Macmillan on his time with the Grenadiers in the Great War: \"There were many in the regiment who were killed on the Western Front who would have made better Prime Ministers than I;' - dramatic pause, and then Bythell added 'He was probably right.\"\n\nIn ten years\" time there may be a Chief of the General Staff who says \"there were many in the army who took redundancy in 2012 who would have made a better CGS than I.\"\n\nAnd there may be many who will say, \"he is probably right.\"\n\nExcept that staying power is itself a quality of command that should not be underestimated. Atlee, when Prime Minister, chose to recall Bill Slim from retirement to be CIGS because he was not convinced by the names put before him by Montgomery, the outgoing chief.\n\nAtlee, himself a former infantry major, said he admired Slim, who had commanded the XIV Army - \"the Forgotten Army\" - in Burma, because \"he makes do with the scrapings of the barrel.\"\n\nThe focus in the army redundancies, perhaps inevitably, on the example of Brigadier Nicky Moffat is misplaced. At 50, and as an officer in the Adjutant-General's Corps, her future would have been limited (a brigadier is guaranteed only one job). She had done well to get where she had - not because she was a women, but because it is difficult for officers in the administrative and support services to compete with those in the combat arms when it comes to promotion boards. At her age, a fine second career will be available, and I suspect that she made a pragmatic calculation.\n\nLucky the enterprise that snaps her up.\n\nThe name that really does disturb me, however (and there may be others, for no lists are being published), is that of Brigadier Justin Maciejewski, who is much younger. Talk to him for five minutes and you will recognise a future CGS. Talk to his superiors for two minutes and you will be in no doubt.\n\nBesides coming from a fine military family - the Maciejewskis fought Stalin's armies and the Nazis - he was a star at Sandhurst and Cambridge, and later at the Staff College, and as a young officer was well-schooled in the thoughtful, no-nonsense infantry way of the Greenjackets. Like Field Marshal Dwin Bramall.\n\nHe won a fine DSO in Iraq in command of his battalion, was then promoted early to be chief of staff of the 3rd Infantry Division, then promoted to be a brigade commander, following which he was made Director of Combat Arms without the usual year at the Royal College of Defence Studies.\n\nIn that job he would have been immersed in the planning for the re-shaping of the army after the cuts.\n\nMore from Allan Mallinson for the Daily Mail...\n\nIn an email to his staff he has made it clear that he is leaving for positive rather than negative reasons.\n\nI do not doubt it.\n\nHowever, what I do know is that Brigadier Maciejewski's intellect, experience and quality of character will be a huge loss to the Army, and will not easily be replaced - if at all. There are few officers who are so widely admired - let alone liked - as he.\n\nHis going will have as much effect in some quarters as the cap-badge cuts to be announced on Thursday.\n\nTwenty years ago, at the time of the \"Options for Change\" redundancies at the end of the Cold War (when it was fashionable to think that it was also the \"End of History\"), losses of names such as Brigadier Maciejewski's made few ripples, for the army was still a pretty big organization.\n\nBut at 82,000 the army will be, in the opinion of many, below critical mass.\n\nSenior commanders in the army will have their work cut out to steady the boat after Thursday's announcement of which cap-badges will face the axe - which families are to be broken up - and also the drip-feed of redundancy names.\n\nI can only hope that they have done and are doing all in their power to persuade the very brightest and best to stay, rather than just accepting volunteers for redundancy because that plays well politically.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 4], "id": "Q222595", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1038047", "Q1076619", "Q128781", "Q1322103", "Q1546449",

This is totally unexpected,\" said political analyst Ignacio Labaqui. \"An eventual Scioli victory, which was the consensus forecast, is clearly at stake.\"\n\n\"I'm not surprised that the margin is narrow but I never imagined Macri would be on top,\" said one stunned Scioli supporter as silence fell over the ruling party's campaign bunker.\n\nOutgoing Argentinian president Christina Fernandez de Kirchner.\n\nPhoto: www.losandes.com.ar\n\nMr Scioli, Buenos Aires governor, drew support from poorer Argentinians who credit Mrs de Kirchner and her late husband and predecessor, Nestor Kirchner, with an expansive welfare system and hauling the economy out of a devastating 2001-2002 depression.\n\nEarly polling showed Mr Macri was popular with the middle class and was favoured by foreign investors who are interested in Argentina's vast energy and metal reserves but are deterred by the stifling controls that Mrs de Kirschner has placed on the economy.\n\nArgentina's next leader will face near-empty liquid reserves in the central bank, a gaping fiscal deficit and high inflation. The main candidates all propose policy reforms to put growth on a more sustainable footing, but differ on the pace and depth of reform.\n\nCentrist candidate Sergio Massa was running in third place in the count.\n\nTo avoid a second round , a candidate would have needed 45 per cent support on Sunday, or 40 per cent with a 10 percentage point lead over his closest rival.\n\nIn another damaging blow to the ruling party, Mr Macri's alliance won the gubernatorial election in Buenos Aires province, Argentina's most populous.\n\nReuters\n\nFollow FairfaxForeign on Twitter\n\nFollow FairfaxForeign on

{"id": 20182192281, "title": "20180411 - Manchester United star Paul Pogba finally has something to shout about", "text": "Manchester United star Paul Pogba finally has something to shout about\n\nPaul Pogba was back in Jose Mourinho's starting line-up and maintained he has respect for the Manchester United manager after their feuding.\n\nIt is a story that has unquestionably harmed United's season, with Mourinho harbouring concerns about an out-of-sorts Pogba and, more specifically, his vociferous agent Mino Raiola. There was definite ignominy in sitting on the bench against Sevilla and Brighton last month, although Pogba insisted otherwise.\n\n'It's true (being benched) has never happened to me, but it can strengthen me,' Pogba told French TV show Telefoot in an interview conducted before his return and released on Sunday.\n\nShare this article\n\nShare\n\n468 shares\n\n'You have to go through these periods to make you stronger. There is no problem with Mourinho. It's not me who picks the team. Ask the coach if you want to know why I play less. I respect his choices.\n\n'It's too early to talk about a departure from United, the situation can change.'\n\nThat Pogba addressed potentially leaving Old Trafford at all seemed surprising if there is absolutely no issue with Mourinho, as he stressed.\n\nEven so, it feels inconceivable that the 25-year-old will not be at United next season and against Swansea he showed he is capable of discipline in a midfield two next to Nemanja Matic.\n\nAny praise is laced with mitigation, of course, given the opposition and that Swansea did not offer any sort of attacking threat before half-time. Pogba had all the time he wanted to take balls off his central defenders and get United moving and this was occasionally a stroll. He won't always be afforded that luxury, and there were some stray passes, but you can only play what's in front of you and so this was encouraging.\n\nThe simple stuff was executed well. Everything was completed with a little more purpose. That was definitely the case after five minutes, when Pogba screened the midfield to intercept a Swansea clearance. Romelu Lukaku was celebrating his 100th Premier League goal 14 seconds later, thanks to Pogba doing the donkey work.\n\nThere were other examples, too, particularly hunting down Sam Clucas to turn Swansea over as the visitors threatened to break. Pogba showed good defensive work at corners and a willingness to break into the box from deep.\n\nHe actually looked like one of those dynamic midfielders who can do a bit of everything and are invaluable in this division. The problem is that United expect more from someone who cost \u00a389million, but mastering the basics is a good start for now.\n\n'I think he played like the team,' Mourinho said.\n\n'The team played very well in the first half, he played very well in the first half.\n\n'The team in the second half went a little bit down and Paul also went a little bit down, but he played 90 minutes in Russia and it's normal to go a little bit down with the rest of the players.'\n\nThey can't play like this against Manchester City if Mourinho is to stop Pep Guardiola wrapping up the title on Saturday. City will see some of the spaces out wide and believe they can overload United.\n\nMourinho, whose son Jose Jnr was on the bench with the coaching staff on Saturday, claimed he is not even thinking about that game. 'I think we have 10 more points than last season, something like that,' he added. 'We have more goals scored, we have conceded fewer, we finished sixth, we're going to try to finish second, so the season is not as bad as you try to make it.\n\n'Manchester City is not important for me. Important is that since we left first position and went to second, we stayed there for the whole season.\n\n'We deserved to feel second in spite of what you can say. You all say the third, fourth, fifth, sixth teams are better than us but they are not better than us because we have more points than them.'\n\nThat was delivered with Carlos Carvalhal, Mourinho's great mate, sitting alongside him. Swansea were far better after a double substitution at half-time - 'Not many coaches do that,' said Mourinho - and look likely to survive. 'This guy is going to keep Swansea up,' Mourinho added. 'He is the manager of the season because they were dead and he is going to save them.'\n\nThat felt an apt description given that one of the colourful Carvalhal's metaphors centred on hospitals and intensive care. Swansea have been discharged and are in the sea now, apparently.\n\n'We are swimming,' Carvalhal said. 'We still need to swim faster. The sharks can push you down.' For Pogba and United, the City sharks are circling.\n\nShare this article\n\nShare\n\n468 shares\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 17], "id": "Q18656", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by":

{"id": 20152373, "title": "20150324 - In Italy, Plans for an Easter Blessing Yield a Lawsuit for a Public School", "text": "In Italy, Plans for an Easter Blessing Yield a Lawsuit for a Public School\n\nBOLOGNA, Italy - The 16 board members of Giosu\u00e8 Carducci Elementary School took their seats, chatting amicably, until the agenda turned to Easter. The board had already agreed to let a Roman Catholic priest offer a blessing at their public school. Now the questions involved setting the date and whether to hold the prayer in the gym.\n\nAnd the matter of the lawsuit.\n\n\"I am absolutely against this motion,\" declared Monica Fontanelli, a board member, who accused the majority of trying to pre-empt the Thursday court hearing by setting the blessing for an earlier date. \"It is wrong that this board is not waiting for the decision of the administrative court.\"\n\nYet others quickly countered that most of the school's students were Catholic, and that the rights of the majority mattered, too. \"I support holding it in the garden so that even passers-by get a blessing!\" offered one board member, jokingly.\n\nNo country in the world is more synonymous with Catholicism than Italy, where the overwhelming majority of the population is baptized as Catholics, and where the pope lives in a city-state surrounded by the heart of Rome.\n\nPhoto Angela Giardino, mother of a student at the Giosu\u00e8 Carducci school in Bologna, Italy, opposes the plan for a blessing. Credit Alessandro Grassani for The New York Times\n\nIn Bologna, like so many of Italy's ancient cities, the history and landscape are intertwined with Catholicism. A statue of the city's patron saint, Petronius, rises between the city's two medieval towers. Catholic churches are scattered throughout a city center known for its elegant sidewalks shaded by porticoes.\n\nYet here, as elsewhere in Italy, Catholicism has long been in retreat. Attendance at Mass has fallen sharply over the decades as many Italians became either nonpracticing or nonbelievers.\n\nThe case over the blessing at the school is part of a continuing debate in Italy over where exactly the church-state boundary lies. A similar case arose at the same school years ago when the issue was whether a priest could offer an Easter prayer in a classroom during school hours. A local court prohibited the prayers.\n\nThis time, the prayers are voluntary and, while still held on school grounds, timed for shortly after the closing bell of classes. A group of parents and teachers filed a legal action, arguing that the prayers are unconstitutional.\n\nSupporters of the voluntary prayers say they fall within the latitude that Italy allows for the church. Italy is a secular state but has a special treaty with the Vatican, which provides that public schools offer an hour of voluntary weekly religious instruction, coordinated by local dioceses.\n\n\"The majority of teachers and students in public schools are Catholics,\" said the Rev. Vittorio Zoboli, one of the priests who made the requests to hold prayers. \"So they are happy to have this.\"\n\nEven as church attendance declines, the influence of the church on politics and public life remains significant - and has been upheld in Italian and European courts.\n\nIn 2011, the European Court for Human Rights overturned its own earlier decision and ruled that state schools in Europe could hang crucifixes in classrooms, concluding that they were \"an essentially passive symbol whose influence on pupils was not comparable to that of didactic speech or participation in religious activities.\"\n\nThat second ruling came after an uproar in Italy when the crucifixes were initially banned.\n\nThe latest prayer controversy in Bologna emerged after priests began their Lenten ritual of canvassing their parishes, carrying supplies of consecrated water, in order to offer Easter blessings to shops, offices and individual homes.\n\n\"There are many people who have never been to church - but they are happy to have their houses blessed!\" Father Zoboli said.\n\nYet a group of parents and teachers was not happy about blessing Giosu\u00e8 Carducci Elementary and two other schools in the same district. Angela Giardino, a mother of a Carducci student, said she sent an email to all the parents of her child's classmates, trying to stir a discussion, warning that the prayer infringed on the rights of non-Catholics and could violate the Constitution.\n\n\"No one answered me,\" said Ms. Giardino, who added that she did not oppose religion or anyone's right to practice it (or their right to receive a blessing) - only where it is conducted.\n\n\"Everything has a place, and the school is not the place for these blessings,\" she said.\n\nEuropean countries delineate the church-state split in different ways. France is famous for its la\u00efcit\u00e9, a strict division that largely forbids religious expression in the public sphere.\n\n\"In Italy, it is different,\" said Francesco Clementi, a constitutional law expert at Perugia University. \"We do not have religion in the state, but we have tradition and relationships that link the Italian Republic with the Catholic Church.\"\n\nMany Italian schools have nativity scenes around Christmas or hold assemblies to sing Christmas songs. The argument is that these rituals are part of the cultural legacy of Italy, a point contested by staunch secularists.\n\n\"Is it fair that everyone has to see this, even if some students are Muslims, Buddhist or atheists?\" asked Adele Orioli, legal adviser to Italy's Union of Atheists and Rationalistic Agnostics.\n\nThe Rev. Raffaelle Buono, who oversees religious education in the Bologna schools, disagreed.\n\n\"What do you mean by this term \"laity\"?\" he asked. \"Two words: inclusive and exclusive. The French way of understanding laity is to exclude. You have to ban every religious symbol. In Italy, by tradition, we understand laity as inclusive. You have to put value on your \"belongings,\" including your religious \"belongings.\"\"\n\nHe added: \"It is not a matter of faith. It is a matter of belonging to a tradition.\"\n\nIn Bologna, the prayer controversy quickly rippled into local newspapers and stirred anger on social media against the complainants. Some said that liberals were willing to make special accommodations to Muslims but not Catholics. Others warned that stripping schools of Christian rituals would open society to an Islamic invasion.\n\nThe March 12 school board meeting at Carducci Elementary was also contentious. The board had selected March 20, 21 and 28 for prayers at Carducci and the two other schools in the district. With anger boiling over, the board voted for the dates.\n\n\"The debate was heated because there is a lot of hatred against anything that has to do with religion,\" said Giovanni Prodi, 43, the board chairman, after the meeting. \"I am a practicing Catholic. I think it is a good thing.\"\n\nThe court hearing will be held Thursday, and Italy's association of atheists and agnostics is also a party to the case. \"We are defending the laity of the state and of public schools,\" Ms. Orioli said.\n\nNo matter what the court decides, the decision's impact will come. The prayers were held at all three district schools last Friday and Saturday. The prayer scheduled for this Saturday, two days after the court hearing, has been canceled.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [3, 8], "id": "Q38", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED",

Where is the consistency?\"\n\nMkhwebane was addressing students about \"good governance, accountability and transparency.\"\n\nIn July, Mkhwebane found that Ramaphosa had deliberately misled Parliament when responding to a question about a R500 000 donation to his 2017 ANC presidential campaign. She recommended that the campaign be investigated for money laundering.\n\nBut Ramaphosa has taken that report on review, and has argued that Mkhwebane overstepped her authority by expanding her investigation from the R500 000 donation, to the financing of his entire campaign.\n\nRamaphosa had raised questions about where Mkhwebane received some of the bank statements contained in her Bosasa report, going as far as suggesting that she obtained them unlawfully.\n\nMkhwebane's office, however, maintains that her report is above board.\n\nRamaphosa had approached the Gauteng High Court in a bid to have certain bank statements in her report sealed and not made available to the public.\n\nDeputy Judge President Aubrey Ledwaba later issued a directive which effectively sealed the file, until the dispute over the legality of the evidence could be resolved.\n\nSource: News24\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 12], "id": "Q258", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED",

Matt Long, a longshot for a backup outfield spot, homered to raise his spring average to .444. Albert Pujols had two hits; he has seven hits in his last 14 at-bats after starting the Cactus League with one hit in 15 at-bats.\n\nON THE MOUND: Jered Weaver worked five innings, giving up three runs and nine hits, including a long home run to Carlos Gonzalez. Manager Mike Scioscia said Weaver's fastball command is \"still developing.\" Weaver said he focused on off-speed pitches Saturday and said the home run came on a slider with poor location. Closer Ernesto Frieri and setup man Joe Smith each worked a scoreless inning.\n\nEXTRA BASES: Trout was hit by a pitch on the left arm. He shrugged it off, took first base, then stole second base on the next pitch. Outfielder Brennan Boesch got a rare spring-training ejection for arguing a called third strike.\n\nUP NEXT: Seattle at 1 p.m. at Tempe Diablo Stadium. On the air: TV: FS West.

Given that there have been new arrivals almost every day for the past few weeks, the total is expected to surge past the 5,000 mark today.\n\nMore than 1,400 migrants have already crossed the Channel in small boats in August alone - a record for a single month - despite there still being ten days before September.\n\nBy contrast, just 1,850 successfully crossed the Channel in the whole of last year.\n\nThe death of the Sudanese migrant on Wednesday once again stoked up cross-Channel tensions, with Calais MP Pierre-Henri Dumont claiming Britain's asylum policy was to blame for the tragedy.\n\nTory MP Tim Loughton, a former children's minister, hit back, claiming the \"lack of humanity\" lay with the French for letting migrants attempt to cross the Channel.\n\nFormer marine Dan O'Mahoney, who is leading Britain's response to the illegal crossings, arrived in France yesterday to continue searching for a solution.\n\nFollowing his meetings, he said: \"[Wednesday's] incident, where a Sudanese migrant lost his life attempting to cross the Channel, served as a tragic reminder of the vital importance of the work the UK and France are engaged in to make this route completely unviable.\"\n\nMr O'Mahoney added: \"People should seek asylum in the first safe country they enter.\n\n\"Those attempting to cross the Channel, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, in unsuitable boats and without appropriate... skills are putting at risk the lives of all those on board.\"\n\nParis has demanded \u00a330million from the UK Government to bolster its Channel patrols, but Home Secretary Priti Patel said any such funds are conditional on France taking back some of the migrants.\n\nAlmost 450 migrants, who claim to be under the age of 18, have arrived without relatives this year. They are all being cared for by Kent County Council - which is looking after a total of 605 under-18s.\n\nThis week the council said its capacity has reached its limits and it \"simply cannot safely accommodate any more new arrivals.\"\n\nIn an attempt to resolve the problem, ministers have urged other councils to take in some of the unaccompanied migrant children.\n\nThe Home Office, the Department for Education and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government are writing to all local authorities urging them to \"come forward, play their part and take responsibility.\"\n\nA Home Office spokesman described the situation as \"unprecedented\" and said the burden being placed on Kent council \"is unacceptable and cannot continue.\"\n\nCouncils now receive \u00a3240 per child per week, with more funding provided for those helping the greatest number of children.\n\nBut critics have said the voluntary nature of the scheme renders it ineffective and insist it should be made a mandatory requirement for councils.\n\nThe Bishop of Dover, Rt Rev Rose Hudson-Wilkin, the Church of England's first black female bishop, accused politicians of \"playing to the gallery.\"\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [45, 52], "id": "Q34640", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1210950", "Q12284", "Q1254874", "Q1616075",

UK Athletics, even before Richard, has focused on events, governance and high performance. It wasn't interested in clubs. But if you look at the likes of Laura Muir and Callum Hawkins, they came through those clubs.\n\n\"I think Richard understood that actually. But he went about things the wrong way. But now it's important now that a new chair comes in quickly.\"\n\nBowker's exit will also delay the search for a new chief executive for UKA which has yet to be begin. Previous boss Niels de Vos left last September with ex-Scottish Athletics supremo Nigel Holl set to remain in temporary charge for the foreseeable future.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [15, 33],

While introducing a screening of his 2004 movie The Libertine, he made inflammatory statements about President Donald Trump.\n\n\"I think he needs help and there are a lot of wonderful dark, dark places he could go,\" Depp said, according to the Guardian.\n\nHe then asked the crowd, \"When was the last time an actor assassinated the president?\"\n\nThe answer is 1865, when John Wilkes Booth shot and killed Abraham Lincoln at Ford's Theatre.\n\n\"It is just a question - I'm not insinuating anything,\" he assured the crowd. \"By the way, this is going to be in the press. It will be horrible. I like that you are all a part of it.\"\n\nHe also claimed that he wasn't referring to himself, since he's not really an actor.\n\nJohnny Depp at Glastonbury, where he made controversial remarks about Donald Trump.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\n\"I lie for a living,\" he clarified. \"However, it has been a while and maybe it is time.\"\n\nWhite House officials were not amused.\n\nA still from the Kathy Griffin video that resulted in her firing from CNN.\n\nPhoto: Twitter\n\n\"The joke is no laughing matter,\" Kellyanne Conway, counsellor to the president, told The Washington Post in a phone interview. \"These things are real.\"\n\nConway called Depp a \"nut job\" and said his statement was \"not a slip of the tongue\" but rather a deliberate attempt to spread \"vile\" ideas that could \"easily inflame lunatics who wish to bring harm.\"\n\n[My joke] did not come out as intended, and I intended no malice.\n\nJohnny Depp\n\nA Secret Service spokesman told The Post that the agency is \"aware of the comment in question. For security reasons, we cannot discuss specifically nor in general terms the means and methods of how we perform our protective responsibilities.\"\n\nDepp is hardly the first celebrity to target Trump.\n\nJohnny Depp as John Dillinger in Public Enemies.\n\nPhoto: Peter Mountain\n\nMadonna came under fire in January, after she said she'd \"thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.\"\n\nComedian Kathy Griffin was roundly criticised - and fired from CNN - after she was photographed holding a mask of what looked like President Trump's bloody severed head.\n\n\"We expect actors and musicians and others to continue to spew hateful rhetoric,\" Conway said Friday.\n\nHow, she wondered, will people react to Depp's remarks?\n\n\"Will people chide him, discipline him or drop him?\" she asked.\n\nIn a sharply worded statement to The Post, deputy White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said: \"President Trump has condemned violence in all forms and it's sad that others like Johnny Depp have not followed his lead. I hope that some of Mr. Depp's colleagues will speak out against this type of rhetoric as strongly as they would if his comments were directed to a Democrat elected official.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Depp has aired his feelings about Trump; he played the then-candidate in Funny or Die's The Art of the Deal: The Movie in early 2016. But that was mere parody - not something the Secret Service might need to investigate.\n\nDepp has been the subject of plenty of bad press in the past year. First there was the very public implosion of his short marriage to Amber Heard, who claimed the actor had physically abused her. Photos of her bruised face circulated on the Internet.\n\nMeanwhile, Depp sued his business managers, who then countersued, going public with some unsavory accusations about the actor, saying that he has compulsive spending disorder and had squandered hundreds of millions of dollars with an outrageously extravagant lifestyle that included spending $30,000 every month on wine. According to a Hollywood Reporter story about Depp's recent troubles, he was also difficult on the set of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, where he routinely showed up late for work, leaving the cast and crew waiting around for hours.\n\nAnd now there are his statements at Glastonbury.\n\nIf Kathy Griffin's experience joking about Trump's death - by holding up a fake severed head that resembled the president - is any indication, there could be some serious blowback. Griffin ended up making a tearful apology but still lost her New Year's Eve gig with CNN.\n\nThis isn't Depp's first public apology. He had to do so on videotape when he and Heard illegally smuggled their dogs into Australia. The formal apology the pair made was stilted and stiff but at least seemed genuine. Later, Depp told Jimmy Kimmel that there had been a few takes of the mea culpa, since it was hard for him to keep his composure.\n\nSo much for saying sorry. But Depp said it himself: He lies for a living.\n\nWashington Post\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [30, 41], "id": "Q37175", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates":

{"id": 2019260943, "title": "20190823 - Boeing wins $23.6M contract to keep Navy F/A-18 planes flying", "text": "Boeing wins $23.6M contract to keep Navy F/A-18 planes flying\n\nAug. 23 (UPI) -- Boeing Co. was awarded a $23.6 million contract by the U.S. Navy for support in solving maintenance issues of F/A-18 Hornet fighter planes.\n\nThe contract, a modification of a prior contract and announced on Thursday by the Defense Department, calls for engineering, logistics, and program management of F/A-18A-D, E/F, and EA-18G aircraft in support of reducing fleet \"out of reporting\" rates and maintenance planning.\n\nThe term refers to a plane grounded because of maintenance or repair issues. The planes, in service since the 1970s, are currently flown by the U.S. Marine Corps as its front-line fighter, by the U.S. Navy as a second-tier fighter, and also by seven international customers. The Marine and Navy planes are expected to have a service life of 20 years, but are wearing out faster than expected due to extensive use.\n\nDefense Department contracts for maintenance and upgrades are regular and numerous, and have included replacement center barrel sections -- the center section of the plane where wings are joined to the fuselage, an expensive undertaking -- and re-opening of production lines. Some of the repairs have been offered to allied air forces, which maintain their own refurbishment and upgrade programs.\n\nIn April alone, three contracts to fix problems on the F/A-18 were announced. Sierra Nevada Corp. received a $13.5 million to fix beacon transmitter and receiver issues, International Enterprise Inc. won a $7.3 million contract to repair color instrument displays and General Electric received a $77.6 million contract for engine repairs.\n\nIn May, Boeing was awarded a $163.9 million one-year contract to continue modernizing the U.S. Navy's F/A-18E/F fighter jet fleet under the service life modification program.\n\nThe planes also use different radar systems, depending on the countries which own them.\n\nThe contract announced on Thursday is expected to be completed by September 2020.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 6], "id": "Q66", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1024445", "Q1084919", "Q201815", "Q214826",

This is the equivalent to roughly \u00a32million a month.\n\nSales at VBL remained stable over the year however losses grew on the back of increased investment in the fashion brand's design, marketing and sales.\n\nEarlier this year the former pop star's fashion business was valued at \u00a3100million following a major cash injection from former Goldman Sachs banker David Belhassen, the man behind French-inspired bakery chain Paul.\n\nShare this article\n\nShare\n\n19 shares\n\nMr Belhassen runs Neo Investment Partners which has bought a minority stake in the firm for \u00a330million.\n\nNews of her financial woes comes 12 months after it was revealed the star had been formally warned the business - which employs 180 staff - could be closed down after failing to file its accounts on time.\n\nRobert Dodds, a director at Victoria Beckham Limited, identified the company's partnership with Target and its Estee Lauder collaboration as two areas likely to bring the company more growth in 2017.\n\nWriting in the financial statement, he wrote: 'The further announcement of a global license agreement with Reebok will further enhance the future profitability of the business.'\n\nHowever it was a very different story for DB Ventures. Sales rose from \u00a310.2million in 2015 to \u00a311.2million last year due to income from partnerships with drinks company Diageo, which makes Haig Club whisky, and insurance group AIA Vitality, among others. He also has endorsement deals with Kent and Curwen menswear and Adidas.\n\nDavid also boasts over 40 million followers on Instagram - more than double that of the mother of his four children - from which he can gain considerable revenue as a social media 'influencer'.\n\nFortunately for Victoria, she is not dependent on her fashion business to maintain her lifestyle.\n\nShe controls a large stake in the main holding company for her and David's business ventures, Beckham Brand Holdings (BBH).\n\nOwnership of the firm is split equally between Victoria, David and Fuller's company XIX Management. BBH contains Victoria's fashion business along with another branch of the couple's complex financial empire, DB Ventures Ltd.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 13], "id": "Q10520", "recognized_by":

{"id": 2018512122, "title": "20181204 - Discovery could help determine which cancer patients will benefit from immunotherapy -- ScienceDaily", "text": "Discovery could help determine which cancer patients will benefit from immunotherapy -- ScienceDaily\n\nIt's a popular question: What did you do over the summer? For Lubaba (Aurna) Khan, the summer of 2018 will be one she will never forget.\n\nIt started on a high note and ended on an even higher one. In June, Khan walked across the stage to accept her degree as a University of Calgary Bachelor of Health Sciences graduate. She received an O'Brien Centre Summer Studentships award, landing a research job with Dr. Pinaki Bose, PhD. Then, unexpectedly, she made a discovery that could help cancer patients throughout the world.\n\nKhan spent the summer hunched over a computer interpreting free, publicly accessible health and genomics data. \"Bioinformatics is the new frontier of medical science,\" says Khan. \"I started my medical education as a biomedical student, looking at cells through a microscope, but looking at cancer biology with the assistance of a computer opens up a new way of thinking about research.\"\n\nKhan was comparing the differences between genes found in cancer cells and those found in normal cells. Working under the guidance of Bose, Khan learned how to construct questions and hypotheses. It was a bumpy start.\n\n\"We wanted to find out how immune genes in cancer cells might be associated with immunotherapy response. There was nothing there, and we were disappointed,\" says Bose, who is an adjunct assistant professor in the departments of biochemistry and molecular biology, and oncology, and is a member of the Arnie Charbonneau Cancer Institute at the Cumming School of Medicine.\n\n\"We adjusted our focus, and discovered that another set of genes, those associated with the extracellular matrix, had a direct connection to how cancer patients respond to immunotherapy.\"\n\nImmunotherapy has become a popular treatment for some cancers. It uses the body's own immune system to attack and kill cancer cells. The treatment is effective, but only for a select few, around 20 to 30 per cent of patients. There is not a clear understanding as to why some people respond better to immunotherapy than others.\n\nThe extracellular matrix may hold some of the answers; it grows within and around both healthy and cancerous cells.\n\n\"We found that genes associated with the extracellular matrix are overly produced in patients who do not respond to immunotherapy,\" says Bose, who is also the director of translational research for the Ohlson Research Initiative. \"These genes are produced by cells surrounding the tumour, and they form a barrier which helps cancer cells evade detection by the immune system.\"\n\nThe UCalgary team shared the discovery with researchers at the University of Toronto who have validated the findings, now published in Nature Communications. \"I was like, wow, I'm a student. I didn't realize how important this was until Dr. Bose pointed out how significant this discovery could be in cancer treatment. It kind of threw me off, but I was extremely excited at the same time,\" says Khan, who is a co-first author on the study.\n\nThe researchers looked more deeply at their findings and discovered a gene signature, which could lead to the development of a simple test that could help determine which patients would benefit from immunotherapy. The next step will be to prove the findings in a lab.\n\n\"Analyzing big data won't replace bench science, but it a great tool for hypothesis-building and leading to new insights,\" says Bose.\n\nFor Khan, this experience has changed the course of her future studies. She always planned to pursue a master's degree in public health, and now sees a future focused on data analysis rather than data collection.\n\nPinaki Bose's research is supported by Ohlson Research Initiative and the Charbonneau Cancer Institute.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [88, 100], "id": "Q679509", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q679509"]}, {"span":

{"id": 20171693803, "title": "20170509 - 1,000 shows later, you still can't beat Flog It!", "text": "1,000 shows later, you still can't beat Flog It!\n\nFlog It!\n\nFriday, BBC1\n\nRating:\n\nChopping Block\n\nMonday, ITV\n\nRating:\n\nThis Is Us\n\nTuesday, Channel 4\n\nRating:\n\nFifteen years is a long time in body fat. As Flog It! celebrated its 1,000th programme, one could only gasp in horror at the changing shape of the nation.\n\nFor the most part, the key presenters on the valuation side had held up, especially host Paul Martin, who actually looks in better form today than he did in 2002 (not least because he's ditched his selection of scarves that should have been flogged along with everything else). But goodness - the difference in the public who turn up to sell their antique wares.\n\nWe must be grateful that widescreen TV is more available today than it was when the series was launched. As the crowd assembled at Bletchley Park for this special edition, it was like watching the entire passenger list of a Caribbean cruise descend en masse. (Trust me, I've been on one - how any cruise ship stays afloat is beyond me.)\n\nThe only exercise the latest batch of hopefuls seems to have managed is the stairway to the attic in the hope of retrieving another gross family heirloom to sell at the show's auction.\n\nYou could almost see the words More Dosh for Tesco Big Food Shop On Friday flash in their relieved eyes when their antique raised more than had been expected.\n\nI've never been a big fan of antiques, but then I am someone who could happily live in an Apple Store window for my entire life. The oldest thing I own is the iPhone 6S, so I was never going to give two figs about ornament horror. But Flog It! is a terrific show. It has beautiful locations - the flashbacks again revealed the truly wondrous places the UK has to offer - and Martin sustains the tension and excitement.\n\nThe problem is that an interesting object can be in the possession of a dull owner, and it is Martin's job to keep the pace and energy up and make people appear more scintillating than they are. And he does. He never comes across as false - just a real enthusiast for antiques and a TV gig he has clearly loved from day one.\n\nDespite my hatred of chipped porcelain and dust, this trip down memory lane reminded us how a simple TV idea can be executed beautifully. Sustaining it over 15 years is a real achievement. Maybe I'll raid my own attic and go along for the 2,000th anniversary - all supposing I can acquire another three stone to make me eligible to take part.\n\nJohn Whaite and Rosemary Shrager, the Laurel and Hardy of culinary TV, returned with a second series of Chopping Block, where three couples hope to win \u00a31,000 in a cookery \"school.\"\n\nRosemary has eaten so many pies, I expect to see her very soon as a Flog It! extra. I've loved her ever since she appeared in Ladette To Lady, trying to instill in ghastly girls a model of decorum.\n\nShe is funny, clearly a terrific chef, and delivers an honest and firm, rather than aggressive approach (this is daytime TV, after all).\n\nIt was all going fantastically well (and I learned more than I do on most cookery shows), but then, after friends Phill and Liam won both the Skills and Main Course rounds, Desserts was split between the other two pairs. And then, who were the winning pair of the day..? All three. Come on, guys; it's a competition. Even in daytime TV, there has to be the \"reveal\" moment.\n\nA terrific show was spoilt by not just one cop-out but two. I learned how to temper chocolate, though, which was a real eye-opener as I never knew chocolate could be so angry.\n\nIf you haven't caught the award-winning This Is Us, the Channel 4 import from the US, I urge you to do so. This week's episode was one of the most moving of the series as Randall (Sterling K Brown) took his dying dad William (Ron Cephas Jones) to Memphis, where the latter had the opportunity to perform one more time.\n\nThe series, which switches between the current day and flashbacks showing how everyone became who they were, is a sublime piece of television.\n\nBeautifully crafted scripts are complemented by a cast who never fail to deliver. It's original, fresh, emotional without being mawkish, and has two very fat characters addressing their body issues.\n\nChrissy Metz (Kate) is fat in real life; Chris Sullivan (Kate's boyfriend, Toby) wears a fat suit for the role. Large people in America are currently up in arms over this devastating revelation, insisting that there are plenty of genuinely fat people out there.\n\nYou're telling me. Flog \"em, I say.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [40, 48], "id": "Q5459980", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q5459980"]}, {"span": [50, 58], "id": "Q5459980",

After keeping a relatively low profile in this country, Mr Blair has now given two major BBC interviews this month and will appear at a Labour Party fundraiser next month.\n\nMr Blair insisted that Britain could still join the single currency if the problems in the eurozone are addressed.\n\nThe former Prime Minister also urged Germany to do more to \"save\" the single currency ahead of a key summit in Brussels later this week.\n\n\"The only thing that will save the single currency now is in a sense a sort of grand plan in which Germany is prepared to commit its economy fully to the single currency,\" Mr Blair said.\n\n\"That means treating the debts of one as the debts of all, which is very hard for Germany to do.\n\n\"It means the other countries in the eurozone need to reform, need precise credible programmes of change to reform so that Europe can regain its competitiveness.\n\n\"Otherwise it is quite unfair to ask Germany to pay.\"\n\nBut Mr Blair - a prominent Europhile - refused to accept that the single currency's troubles meant the UK would never join.\n\n\"If they sort it all out and Europe moves forward again then Britain is going to have a very interesting choice to make,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking of his policy towards joining the euro when he was Prime Minister, Mr Blair added: \"I always took the view that economically you had to make an unambiguous case for Britain joining.\n\n\"Politically however, I was always in favour of keeping us very positive towards the project of European integration, and able to join at any time we wanted to do so.\"\n\nThe former premier said the \"broad sweep of history\" showed that European integration would continue regardless of the fate of the eurozone. Britain needed to protect its alliance with the EU in order to exercise influence, he said.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 10], "id": "Q9545", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED",

{"id": 2018382622, "title": "20180221 - How Kendrick Lamar and Jay Rock's 'King's Dead' music video achieved those impossibly long zooms", "text": "How Kendrick Lamar and Jay Rock's 'King's Dead' music video achieved those impossibly long zooms\n\nAs if the sight of Kendrick Lamar eating an elote up a palm tree alone wasn't enough, there were more staggering, unprecedented visuals in the music video for his Jay Rock, Future and James Blake collaboration \"King's Dead,\" including perhaps the longest camera zooms ever staged.\n\nPulling in and out of rooftops, the zooms were reminiscent of the kind Brian de Palma favoured back in the 80s, but had a hyperreal feel to them all of their own, the artists being shot as clearly as if the camera were there on the rooftops just a few feet away.\n\nAchieving them took a lot of brain power, the sourcing of rare lenses and a heroic effort from the focus puller, Director of Photography on the video, Christopher Ripley, explains.\n\n\"From the beginning, we knew that a lot of the video's key moments would have to hinge on these impossibly long zooms,\" he told The Independent. \"Dave [Free] and Jack [Begert, co-directors] were both really excited to avoid visual effects as much as possible. They wanted to really put all three artists on rooftops and find a way to do the zooms for real.\n\n\"I spent a couple days researching esoteric zoom lenses and eventually came across this rare Canon 50-1000mm zoom they had made for news and sports crews. We started calling around but nobody had that lens. Eventually, we found one on them available at a rental house in Burbank but even that wasn't really enough range to take us all the way from street level to a clear shot of someone performing on a rooftop. I ended up having to rent a ridiculously high resolution 8k camera so that they could digitally zoom even further into the image and get to where they needed to be.\"\n\nActually pulling the shot off by hand proved challenging however and (not for the first time in a Kendrick video) robots had to be brought in.\n\n\"Dave and Jack also wanted to be able to quickly zoom in and have the camera land on a perfect frame, perfectly on beat with the song,\" Ripley explained. \"But when you're all the way zoomed in on a freakishly long lens, even the tiniest mistake makes the frame completely different. During our tests, we would sometimes even see the frame shake whenever traffic drove by.\n\n\"So I needed something that could give us a lot of really precise control over the framing. I called up a company in Santa Monica that specializes in robotic camera controllers and did a few tests, and we finally settled on a small robotic unit that would perfectly pan and tilt the camera and control the zoom, so it could smash in from a super wide into an impossibly close shot and land a perfect frame every time.\n\n\"I've done a number of crazy robotic rigs with that company over the years and they're always super nonchalant: \"Oh, yeah, one of those, no problem. We've done that a million times,\" but when I pitched them the zoom setup, they stopped for a second and then said, \"Yeah, we're gonna have to test that. We've never done anything like that before.\" I was thrilled I finally found something they hadn't done before.\"\n\nOne element of the shots that couldn't be controlled by a robot, however, was the focus, as the team wanted to be able to react on the fly to the artists if they switched up their performance and moved differently.\n\nRipley added: \"My focus puller Megan [McCarthy Johnson] was really under the gun - she had to keep everything perfectly in focus as the camera was robotically whipping around between people and crash-zooming in and out. She did an amazing job and kept her cool the whole job.\"\n\nThe results of this process, also used for the scenes of Kendrick in the palm tree and Jay Rock in the barbers, are iconic, and though the shots are dramatic they're edited in such a way that they still feel in keeping with the goofy overall tone of the video.\n\nReuse content\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [4, 18], "id": "Q130798",

Please refresh the page if you do not see a player above at that time.]\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is slated to deliver remarks on Tuesday, amid questions over President Donald Trump's impeachment trial in the Senate.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi has not yet delivered the impeachment articles to the Senate, but McConnell and other Republican leaders have indicated that they will proceed with establishing impeachment rules despite Democrats' objections, according to a new report.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry was triggered by Trump's July 25 phone call with newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Trump pressed his counterpart to announce an investigation into the U.S. president's political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nMcConnell's remarks come days after the U.S. decision to take out Iran's top commander, Gen. Qasem Soleimani, in an airstrike in Baghdad.\n\nSoleimani led an elite branch of Iran's armed forces, the Quds Force, and has been blamed for the deaths of many Americans across the Middle East.\n\nThe killing has been met with criticism from members of Congress and 2020 candidates for president, who argue that the move could trigger a major conflict between the United States and Iran. Iranian officials also rebuked the decision, calling it \"extremely dangerous & a foolish escalation.\"\n\nSubscribe to CNBC on YouTube.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 9], "id": "Q355522",

This, after persistent calls for the Republican presidential hopeful to do so, particularly from fellow candidate Newt Gingrich.\n\nBut during last night's GOP debate, Romney \"had a difficult time talking comfortably about his taxes,\" National Journal Congressional Correspondent Major Garrett observed on \"CBS This Morning\" Friday. It was, he noted, the second debate in a row where that happened.\n\nFull CBSNews.com coverage: Election 2012\n\n\"I've been trying to figure out what the deal is in South Carolina is on this issue. He knows it's coming, he knows his father, when he ran for president in 1968, set a new standard of transparency, 12 years. It seemed that Mitt Romney didn't even know that story,\" Garrett said. \"And when asked if he would meet that, he said 'maybe.' Why the level of discomfort? I can't quite figure it out.\"\n\nBut, Garrett suggested, a possible answer is that Romney is \"uncomfortable releasing the charitable contributions he may have made to his church. The Mormon Church is an issue that doesn't cut well for him in South Carolina.\n\n\"He may be concerned about 10 or 20 percent of his income going to the church and that becoming a sudden issue in South Carolina. That's the only rational explanation I can come up with,\" Garrett said.\n\nFor more of Garrett's thoughts on the state of the Republican race, click on the video above.\n", "entity_mentions":

Since 1990, the nuclear energy industry has invested more than $90 billion in capital expenditures to improve and upgrade facilities. Those improvements have helped yield a 33 percent increase in nuclear-generated electricity production over that period.\n\nThe Energy Information Administration forecasts that electricity demand will increase 28 percent by 2040, the equivalent of 339 new large power plants. Meeting that demand with low-carbon electricity sources requires recognition of nuclear energy's many attributes. These include round-the-clock production of large amounts of electricity to help stabilize the electric grid; clean-air compliance; forward electricity price stability; fuel and technology diversity; and high-paying jobs at facilities that can withstand extreme natural and man-made events.\n\nPresident and Chief Executive\nNuclear Energy Institute\nWashington, June 19, 2013\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [28, 35], "id": "Q9684", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q9684"]}, {"span": [117, 129], "id": "<NIL>", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q12779928", "Q16733394", "Q5001667", "Q5001709"]}, {"span": [182, 195], "id": "Q30", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1054125", "Q1143805", "Q1297366", "Q1330164", "Q1389353", "Q140185", "Q1465109", "Q1619662", "Q164134", "Q1968496", "Q2068082", "Q2299158", "Q244847", "Q2654269", "Q2738955", "Q287804", "Q30", "Q3054793", "Q334526", "Q3590565", "Q3590570", "Q3590572", "Q48525", "Q610674", "Q742661", "Q787993", "Q7892202", "Q83873577", "Q861654", "Q913651"]}, {"span": [585, 618], "id": "Q1133499", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q11191", "Q1133499"]}, {"span": [1169, 1193], "id": "Q7067942", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q7067942"]}, {"span": [1194, 1204], "id": "Q61", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1018448", "Q1026008", "Q1088831", "Q1223", "Q166186", "Q1999182", "Q212654", "Q219563", "Q23", "Q2446223", "Q2555815", "Q263418", "Q484538", "Q48525", "Q485408", "Q489571", "Q495037", "Q496486", "Q497200", "Q501559", "Q511164", "Q550397", "Q56149", "Q594697", "Q61", "Q61148", "Q761885", "Q79281", "Q7971948", "Q7971960"]}], "evaluation_span": [222, 1220], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [331, 335], "entity_id": "DATETIME", "name": "Unknown", "type": "DATETIME", "coref": false}, {"id": 1, "span": [389, 399], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY", "coref": false}, {"id": 2, "span": [498, 500], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY", "coref": false}, {"id": 3, "span": [585, 618], "entity_id": "Q1133499", "name": "Energy Information Administration", "type": "Q43229", "coref": false}, {"id": 4, "span": [667, 669], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY", "coref": false}, {"id": 5, "span": [681, 685], "entity_id": "DATETIME", "name": "Unknown", "type": "DATETIME", "coref": false}, {"id": 6, "span": [705, 708], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY", "coref": false}, {"id": 7, "span": [762, 768], "entity_id": "Q623", "name": "carbon", "type": "Q43460564", "coref": false}, {"id": 8, "span": [1025, 1035], "entity_id": "Q11016", "name": "technology", "type": "Q11862829", "coref": false}, {"id": 9, "span": [1139, 1148], "entity_id": "Q1255921", "name": "president", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871", "coref": false}, {"id": 10, "span": [1153, 1168], "entity_id": "Q484876", "name": "chief executive officer", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871", "coref": false}, {"id": 11, "span": [1169, 1193], "entity_id": "Q7067942", "name": "Nuclear Energy Institute", "type": "Q43229", "coref": false}, {"id": 12, "span": [1194, 1204], "entity_id": "Q61", "name": "Washington, D.C.", "type": "Q27096213|Q43229", "coref": false}, {"id": 13, "span": [1206, 1219], "entity_id": "DATETIME", "name": "Unknown", "type": "DATETIME", "coref": false}]}
{"id": 20173617465, "title": "20170924 - MPs hear of more meddling from FIFA", "text": "MPs hear of more meddling from FIFA\n\nThe extent FIFA president Gianni Infantino and his lieutenants go to in order to influence supposed independent decision-making in Zurich was laid bare in Westminster yesterday.\n\nFormer FIFA governance chief Miguel Maduro, who lasted 11 months in the post, told the DCMS sport select committee that his sacking followed him blocking Russian deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko from the FIFA Council because of a conflict of interests with his senior political role.\n\nBut FIFA secretary general Fatma Samoura warned Maduro that barring Mutko would lead to next year's World Cup in Russia being a 'disaster' and place Infantino's presidency in jeopardy.\n\nShare this article\n\nShare\n\n16 shares\n\nPortuguese academic Maduro, speaking under parliamentary privilege, said: 'The secretary general made it clear to me that it was extremely problematic.\n\n'More than that, she said we needed to find a solution to declare Mr Mutko eligible, otherwise the presidency itself would be in question and the World Cup would be a disaster.'\n\nInterference from on high at FIFA has also led to former investigative ethics chief Cornel Borbely - axed like Maduro on the eve of the FIFA Congress in Bahrain last May - having to turn down a request to give evidence to the same select committee about sports governance.\n\nChairman Damian Collins wrote to Infantino seeking permission for Borbely to attend but received a letter back from Samoura. She refused on the grounds of confidentiality, adding Borbely could face potential criminal action under Swiss law if he did so.\n\nCollins said he was surprised that Samoura, rather than Infantino, had replied and did not refer the request to the FIFA ethics committee.\n\nAnswering questions about the lack of real change at FIFA since Infantino succeeded the disgraced Sepp Blatter, Maduro said Infantino had wanted to make reforms but had chosen to 'politically survive, preserving his presidency' above protecting the independent bodies.\n\nIt has not gone unnoticed by football agents, who dislike family overly interfering with their management of players, that three Premier League footballers who failed to achieve the transfers they wanted during the last window - Jonny Evans (above) of West Bromwich and Arsenal pair Calum Chambers and Jack Wilshere - all have family members involved in their representation.\n\nClubs tend to be a lot more honest with agents about a player's future than with his family, whom they would not want to upset.\n\nQuest's bid for TV rights\n\nQuest, the low-profile TV station, are one of the parties showing an interest in bidding for the Football League highlights contract which will start next season, with Channel 5 not expected to renew their partnership.\n\nQuest is available on all platforms including Freeview and is a sister channel of Eurosport on the Discovery network who have the TV rights to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nQuest have already shown an interest in football by screening various pre-season tournaments and a clash of Eurosport scheduling has seen them pick up coverage of snooker and superbikes. It is also expected that the super-wealthy Liberty Group, who own Discovery, will offer considerably more for the Football League rights than BBC.\n\nOnly the commercially rampant RFU could start selling their new in-stadium England Rugby Hospitality at Twickenham, that launches in November 2018, before the start of this year's autumn internationals.\n\nIt will be a big surprise if Roy Hodgson's backroom staff at Crystal Palace does not include performance analyst Andy Scoulding, who was alongside him at Fulham, Liverpool and England.\n\nScoulding also had the nightmare experience of joining failed manager Gary Neville in Valencia.\n\nMeanwhile, one familiar face greeting Hodgson at Crystal Palace will be Joanne Whittle, head of PR and Media, with whom he worked throughout his time at the FA.\n\nUnfortunately for Hodgson, Whittle will be leaving at the end of the month having handed in her notice before Frank de Boer's brief reign to take a break after 30 years in football.\n\nShare this article\n\nShare\n\n16 shares\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [31, 35], "id": "Q253414", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q12231710",

{"id": 2015497805, "title": "20150923 - Dinner With Saddam review - can dictators be funny?", "text": "Dinner With Saddam review - can dictators be funny?\n\nCan you have a comedy about tyranny? Chaplin got away with in The Great Dictator. But Anthony Horowitz's play faces two obvious problems. Given what we know about the tragic fate of Iraq, it is difficult to raise a smile about the embarrassments of Saddam Hussein dropping in for dinner. When a wildly farcical first half gives way to a sombre political message in the second, it is as if David Hare has suddenly taken over from Ray Cooney.\n\nHorowitz has seized on the fact that Saddam did indeed descend on the homes of Baghdad citizens to avoid his enemies and show solidarity with his people. We see a deeply divided Sunni family, on the eve of invasion in March 2003, coping with the news that the leader is about to arrive. Husband and wife are at odds, their anti-Saddam daughter is in love with a Shia actor and the household is in chaos. But jokes about blocked toilets, water shortages and the confusion of rat poison and exotic spices that might seem funny in a western farce tend to stifle laughter when they occur in a city suffering from United Nations sanctions.\n\nWith the arrival of Saddam himself, the play takes a completely different turn. We are left in no doubt that Saddam, played with virtuosic menace by an almost unrecognisable, thickly moustached Steven Berkoff, is filled with the arbitrary cruelty of the despot. A security guard who unwisely yawns is taken out to be shot and, recalling the fate of his kith and kin, Saddam remarks on one who died a most unusual death: \"It was completely natural.\"\n\nShobu Kapoor, Sanjeev Bhaskar, Rebecca Grant and Ilan Goodman in Dinner With Saddam. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian\n\nSaddam also becomes the vehicle for Horowitz's genuine anger about the actions of western governments: we are reminded that the dictator would never have come to power without the CIA, that the Americans were supportive of Iraq's war with Iran and that the British were gassing Kurds long before Saddam Hussein was born. All these charges may be just, but they mean the farcical action is suspended in order to give Saddam the floor.\n\nA part of me admires Horowitz, a skilled TV writer and author of a new James Bond novel, Trigger Mortis, for boldly using a popular form to make political points. But he never quite marries the two, and while I'm normally receptive to faecal and fart jokes, it's difficult to laugh when they stem from a sewage crisis caused by an international ban on the importation of chlorine.\n\nThe play is clearly prompted by a sense of savage indignation, but our collective guilt takes the shine off the farcical gingerbread. Berkoff, mixing uncivil leers at his host's daughter with the danger of a cobra who could strike at any moment, is always a pleasure to watch.\n\nLindsay Posner's fast-moving production has good support, from Sanjeev Bhaskar as the harassed householder, Rebecca Grant as his mutinous daughter and Ilan Goodman as both a security boss and a Shia soap star. But, as Shakespeare said in Love's Labour's Lost: \"To move wild laughter in the throat of death? It cannot be, it is impossible.\"\n\n\u2022 At Menier Chocolate Factory, London, until 14 November.

Bailey says his mother was abused after Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner used insult in Commons debate\n\nA Conservative MP has claimed his mother and staff were abused after Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner called a colleague \"scum\" in parliament.\n\nMs Rayner apologised after she used the language about Tory MP Chris Clarkson during a fiery Commons debate on Wednesday.\n\nBut Shaun Bailey, the MP for West Bromwich West, suggested members of the public had copied her behaviour.\n\nHe said his mother had called him last night to say that \"type of wording\" had been used down the phone to her \"because she was my mother.\"\n\n\"Did the honourable lady just call me scum?\" - Tory MP Chris Clarkson clashes with Labour's Angela Rayner\n\nSpeaking in the Commons, Mr Bailey, the MP for West Bromwich West, said: \"I can take the rough and tumble of this place as much as anyone.\n\n\"But some of the language we saw yesterday was abhorrent and particularly the use of the word \"scum.\"\n\n\"Now, I'm sorry, but when I got a phone call at 11.30 last night from my mum saying she'd had people using that type of wording down the phone at her because she was my mother and today my staff members have called me [to report] that type of abhorrent abuse, it is absolutely not on.\"\n\nMr Bailey asked Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg for a debate on the standards of conduct in the chamber, adding: \"The language we use impacts people beyond us.\"\n\nChris Clarkson was right but pompous to demand Angela Rayner apology\n\nHe suggested Ms Rayner should appear before MPs to apologise to them and \"perhaps to my mum as well.\"\n\nMr Rees-Mogg reminded MPs of the guide to parliamentary practice, noting: \"Good temper and moderation are the characteristics of parliamentary language.\n\n\"Inevitably, in discussing heated political matters, people state their case forcefully but they must do so politely.\"\n\nMr Clarkson said Ms Rayner had called him \"scum\" after he insinuated that members of the shadow front bench believe the Covid-19 pandemic is a \"good crisis\" to exploit.\n\nMs Rayner later apologised for the language \"used in a heated debate.\"\n",

{"id": 2013136540, "title": "20130124 - American Mumbai Plotter to Be Sentenced in Chicago", "text": "American Mumbai Plotter to Be Sentenced in Chicago\n\nA small-time American drug dealer-turned-terrorist plotter who helped plan a brutal 2008 attack on Mumbai, India, learns Thursday whether his wide-ranging cooperation with U.S. investigators will earn him any leniency from the sentencing judge.\n\nDavid Coleman Headley, 52, faces a maximum life prison term when U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber sentences him for his role in a three-day rampage in which 10 gunmen from a Pakistani-based militant group fanned out across Mumbai, attacking a crowded train station, the landmark Taj Mahal Hotel and other targets. Around 160 people were killed, including children.\n\nProsecutors, though, are asking for a relatively lenient term of 30 to 35 years, which leaves open the possibility Headley one day could go free. Headley seemed to leap at the chance to spill secrets following his 2009 arrest and continued providing details even after the U.S. government agreed not to seek the death penalty in exchange for his cooperation.\n\n\"I and victims' families think he should spend the life in prison,\" said James Kreindler, an attorney for relatives of American victims. \"Thirty-five years will upset some people ... but if that sentence means you got good information out of him ... and he gets out with a few years to live, some can tolerate it.\"\n\n\nFILE - In this May 23, 2011 file courtroom sketch, David Coleman Headley is shown in federal court in Chicago. Headley, who was convicted of charges related to a central role he played in the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India, is scheduled to be sentenced Thursday, Jan. 24, 2013, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Tom Gianni, File) Close\n\nProsecutors say Headley, who was born in the U.S. to a Pakistani father and American mother, was motivated in part by his hatred of India going back to his childhood. He changed his birth name from Daood Gilani in 2006 so he could travel to and from India more easily to do reconnaissance without raising suspicions.\n\nHe never pulled a trigger in the attack that's been called India's 9/11, but his contribution to the Pakistani-based militant group, Lashkar-e-Taiba, made the assault more deadly. He conducted meticulous scouting missions - videotaping and mapping targets - so the attackers who had never been to Mumbai adeptly found their way around.\n\n\"What he did was unfathomable,\" Kreindler said. \"Imagine what is going through a person's mind who is videotaping these places knowing what will happen there later.\"\n\nProsecutors also praise Headley for testifying against Tahawwur Rana, a Chicago businessman convicted of providing aid to Lashkar and backing a failed plot to attack a Danish newspaper for publishing depictions of the Prophet Muhammad. Rana, sentenced last week to 14 years in prison, claimed his friend Headley duped him.\n\nTestifying at Rana's trial, Headley spoke in a monotone voice, seemingly detached, even as he described one proposal for the never-carried-out Danish plot to behead newspaper staff and throw their heads onto a street.\n\nIn video excerpts of his interviews with the FBI after his arrest, Headley appears flippant, cool and calculating. As he revealed Rana's name, he told an investigator in an upbeat voice, \"That probably is going to be good a plus for me. Also for you.\"\n\nIn big cases where suspects cooperate, prosecutors often ask for leniency. It's both a reward and a message to future suspects that they, too, could get a break if they spill their secrets. Still, for a reviled figure like Headley to get a sentence less than sentences routinely meted out to convicted drug traffickers or child pornographers could prompt criticism.\n\nProsecutors seemed to anticipate that in their filing, acknowledging that, \"Determining the appropriate sentence for David Headley requires consideration of uniquely aggravating and uniquely mitigating factors.\"\n",

{"id": 2015574269, "title": "20150304 - Barclays\" 30-year attempt at taking on Wall Street is coming to an end", "text": "Barclays\" 30-year attempt at taking on Wall Street is coming to an end\n\nThis is a great shame, and not just for the bank and its shareholders. There are many in the City who would have liked to see a UK-based giant in investment banking; as these latest results confirm yet again, that boat has now sailed.\n\nBarclays will probably retain a decent presence in investment banking - though even that isn't truly certain anymore - but it will not be part of the global top tier.\n\nIt all started for Barclays in 1984 when it became clear that the old rules governing the City of London were about to be torn up. Like many other institutions, Barclays decided that it needed to act fast, not to be left behind; with the benefit of hindsight, it probably panicked. That year it purchased stakes in Wedd Durlacher Mordaunt, a firm of jobbers, and then de Zoete and Bevan, a stockbroker; both firms were fully integrated into Barclays\" own stockbroking business when the rules changed and full universal banking became permissible in 1986. In Barclays: The Business of Banking, 1690-1996, Margaret Ackrill and Leslie Hannah calculated that the two firms managed to extract \u00a3129m from Barclays for their goodwill, a huge sum of money in those days that enriched the old partner families and made it one of the most expensive takeovers of the Big Bang.\n\nNeedless to say, it started to go wrong immediately for the new Barclays de Zoete Wedd: the cost of integrating the three firms\" IT systems turned out to be prohibitive, and moving the combined businesses to a refitted ex-car park in the City also cost a fortune. Staff costs also jumped as a war for talent broke out, complete with golden hellos and golden parachutes. Nevertheless, by 1990 BZW, as Barclays\" investment bank was called, had reached fifth on the global league tables for mergers and acquisitions. But by 1992, the property crash and recession meant that Barclays had to announce a big pre-tax loss; and even though this was a retail bank problem, by 1998 much of BZW was sold off to Credit Suisse.\n\nThe firm thought it couldn't compete in equity and corporate finance, which were the parts it flogged to the Swiss; the smaller, truncated successor to BZW was called Barclays Capital and focused on fixed income. But that was merely the end of Part II of the British bank's great dalliance with investment banking: an ambitious American banker called Bob Diamond had joined the firm two years previously. He soon started to grow the investment bank again, focusing on its core areas, and also built a major asset management business. In 2008, Barclays snapped up Lehman Brothers\" US operations; it felt like a great bargain. The combined business looked as if it could rival the great titans of Wall Street.\n\nThe dream didn't last long, however, and not just because of Libor and the rest, scandals that affected the whole industry. First, Barclays Global Investors was sold to BlackRock to raise capital; and now the investment bank is being shrunk dramatically.\n\nThe problem was capital: firms held very little of it and were able to operate in a highly leveraged manner before the crisis. Now, they need to hold much greater amounts of capital, and many can no longer hide their fundamentally uneconomic nature. The industry is becoming more concentrated as a result of being safer, pushing minor, more marginal players out of business. Compliance costs have also exploded, which is having the same impact.\n\nThere are other reasons for the demise of some universal banks. One can be blamed on Brussels: EU rules on remuneration, which push up fixed costs, are utterly self-defeating and are - as one of many side-effects - inflicting great damage to the prospects of EU-based firms while helping US and Asian competitors. Another can be pinned on Westminster: the banking levy makes no sense.\n\nAntony Jenkins has emphasised he is not going to be endlessly patient with the investment bank\n\nWhen the Diamond era came to an end in 2012, the political and economic pressures were aligned. Jenkins\" language this week - emphasising that he is not going to be endlessly patient with that part of the business - confirms that there is only one way for the investment bank, and that is down.\n\nThe rise, fall, rebirth and final decline of Barclays\" investment bank is a tragic tale. It means that US, and in time Chinese banks, will eventually dominate that sector, for better or for worse.\n\nMy own view is that the City is a great platform; its success doesn't depend on the nationality of the investment banking players it hosts. One thing is for sure: my theory will soon be put to the test.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 8], "id": "Q245343", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1965477",

To ensure this doesn't happen again, they call an emergency meeting - just like Kristy and the gals in The Baby-Sitters Club.\n\nIt's decided the legislation of \"bro code\" is far too confusing, so they replace it with a blanket rule of: just don't be a wang.\n\nKristy, Claudia, Stacey, Dawn and the rest of the gals.Source:Channel 10\n\nOsher walks in wearing a cardigan from his own fashion line, OsherKosher B'Gosher. He's got a single date card and Sasha's the lucky boy.\n\nOsherKosher B'Gosher: casual knits and simple basics.Source:Channel 10\n\nThis single date's all about learning some kind of exotic dance. Sasha strips down to a Chesty Bonds and they proceed to rub up against each other.\n\nSam gets easily flustered by Sasha and it's hard to understand why. On one hand, he's the kind of brave yet caring guy who'd have no problem fishing your iPhone out of the toilet with his bare hands if you accidentally dropped it in. But on the other hand, he has weird Shannon Noll/sleazy real estate agent vibes.\n\nAfter the dance lesson, they retire to the courtyard to drink cocktails. They trade beautiful stories about their step-dads and it makes me feel terrible for saying Sasha's a cross between Shannon Noll and a real estate agent.\n\nThe date ends with an official performance of the dance they learnt in full costume.\n\nI don't know what's more embarrassing: the bad dance or Sasha's pants.\n\nThey're the same kind worn by check-out chicks at Woolworths across Australia. You know the ones - thigh hugging with a surprising flair at the bottom. Usually paired with a chunky black Colorado shoe.\n\n\"Do you have Flybuys?\"Source:Channel 10\n\nMedicating themselves with wine after that mortifying experience, Sasha drops that he was once engaged and Sam tries to play it cool. Then he scores a rose.\n\nHe wants to kiss her but he's waiting for a sign. While Sam tries to pin the rose on his shirt, he just stares at her without blinking for 30 secs. No pasha for Sasha.\n\nBack at the mansion, the boys find a group date card. Pippi Longstocking has the honour of reading it.\n\nIt's Pippi Longstocking hey ho ho ha he ha ha.Source:Channel 10\n\nAlex and Drew miss out and the other boys wind up on some farm where they meet Sam and Osher.\n\n\"I don't know if you guys know this about me but I'm a HUGE animal lover - especially when it comes to dogs,\" Sam says, with one of the dogs she once loved wrapped around her neck.\n\n\"I like animals but I LOVE fashion.\"Source:Channel 10\n\nThe fellas are told they'll be posing topless with dogs for a magazine photo shoot.\n\nSam says she selected the dogs to match each boy's personality. If that's the case, the choices are quite offensive.\n\nTBH, the dogs hate being compared to a single guy on a dating show.Source:Channel 10\n\nThe most surprising thing to come out of the challenge is that we find out Josh Thomas has abs.\n\n\"Like Zooey Deschanel, I'm quirky AND sexy!\"Source:Channel 10\n\nMichael scores the single date after the challenge and Kayne is feeling overlooked.\n\nHe's been flying under the radar with Sam for quite some time now, so when the cocktail party rolls around, he's determined to impress her.\n\nBut how does a guy who did a failed handstand on his first night crank it up a notch? Turns out Kayne has two killer moves with the ladies: Acrobatics. And rap.\n\nNot only has he written some sick rhymes for Sam, but he also decides to casually spit them out under the backyard gazebo.\n\nIt's mortifying. Oddly, I couldn't find the lyrics on metrolyrics.com along with all the other top 40 hits, so I transcribed them for you:\n\nYo, yo yo, check it.\n\nWay back at the start of the year. Through the hard times, tear after tear.\n\nI saw an ad for The Bachelorette season one. So I jumped online and filled the forms, it had begun.\n\nNow here I am, which I never thought way back when. But look at me now, sitting in front of a perfect 10.\n\nI'm very grateful for the roses and my group dates. I have more to offer, so I'll grab the wine and you grab the plates.\n\nI'll give you the hot tip: when I first saw you, you made me bite my bottom lip.\n\nHappiness is on the top, I must say. Treating people with respect, everyone equal, that's my life, namaste.\n\nPrint them out and put them on your fridge.\n\nKayne, what's good?Source:Channel 10\n\nSasha also scores some more one-on-one time. He's awkward because he's still dying to kiss Sam.\n\nThe tension between them is rising and it gets to the point where Sasha's either going to kiss Sam or dry hump the cane lounge. So Sam allows a pash. And she's all cool and confident about it.\n\nThe Woolworths pants sealed the deal.Source:Channel 10\n\nThings aren't going so well for Drew or his hair. It was being a bit stubborn so he just had to slick it all up into a tight bun.\n\nA crappy hair day can ruin anyone's confidence, and it's all downhill from here for Drew.\n\nSam knows that Drew's fallen too fast too soon and she's worried about him. She doesn't want to string him along for weeks and then hurt him.\n\nSo when it comes time for the rose stubs to be distributed, he misses out.\n\nThey then beam text messages to each other from across the room and all is right.\n\n\"Bai!\"Source:Channel 10\n\n\"I'm broken.\"Source:Channel 10\n\nFor more observations on The Baby-Sitters Club and Woolworths pants, follow me on Twitter:

{"id": 20191207125, "title": "20191213 - tips, racecards and preview for day two of The International meeting on Saturday", "text": "tips, racecards and preview for day two of The International meeting on Saturday\n\nTHE INTERNATIONAL meeting concludes on Saturday and there are several cracking betting opportunities to be had.\n\nThe Caspian Caviar Gold Cup and the International Hurdle are the feature races on a top day of jumping.\n\n\nRace 1 - 12.10 JCB Triumph Trial Juvenile Hurdle\n\nAn intriguing opener can go the way of BOTOX HAS.\n\nGary Moore's youngster won by a wide-margin in a weak race on debut but ran a cracker in defeat here last month.\n\nThat looks the best form on offer and he gets the nod ahead of Flat recruit Group Stage, who was a cosy winner on hurdling bow at Leicester.\n\nLanger Dan concedes weight all round but he is unbeaten and commands respect, while the booking of Richard Johnson on Tremwedge catches the eye.\n\n\n\nRace 2 - 12.45 Ryman Novices' Chase\n\nThe Twiston-Davies team think the world of GOOD BOY BOBBY.\n\nHe was made to work harder than expected for victory at Wetherby last time, but he would have found the trip on the sharp side and he was strong at the finish.\n\nHe will relish the return to 2m4f and can outstay Mister Fisher, who ran well on chasing debut behind Torpillo at Warwick. That rival disappointed at Sandown last weekend.\n\nWe likely haven't seen the best of Beakstown yet but he needs to start delivering on the track.\n\nMarket support for the talented Champagne Platinum should be noted on his first run of the season for his powerful connections.\n\n\n\nRace 3 - 1.20 Cheltenham Club Handicap Chase\n\nDESTRIER ran with plenty of credit when third in the Haldon Gold Cup on his seasonal reappearance.\n\nThis is a drop in class and he gets the nod ahead of admirable veteran Croco Bay, who returns to the scene of his shock Grand Annual victory.\n\nBallywood was third on testing ground at Ascot last time and will prefer these sounder conditions, though there is a suspicion the handicapper has caught up with him.\n\nTheinval runs for the first time since crashing out at Galway in the summer, but he won't be far away if putting his best foot forward.\n\n\n\nRace 4 - 1.55 Caspian Caviar Gold Cup Handicap Chase (Grade 3)\n\nIt's a real pity that Riders Ofthe Storm won't take his place in the line-up, but it remains a fantastic race.\n\nCepage chased home that horse when a fine second at Aintree on his reappearance and he was second to Frodon in this contest 12 months ago.\n\nHis yard are in fine form and he looks sure to run a big race under top-weight, but he may have to settle for the silver medal again, this time behind WARTHOG.\n\nDavid Pipe's charge ran a screamer on his first start after a wind op when third in the BetVictor Gold Cup here last month.\n\nHe jumped and travelled beautifully on the whole before getting tired from the back of the second last.\n\nThat will have blown away the cobwebs, his mark remains unchanged and he gets in off a feather-weight here.\n\nPaul Nicholls has won five of the last 10 runnings of this valuable race and he holds another strong hand with Secret Investor and Brelan D'As.\n\nClondaw Castle ran well for a long way in the Arkle on his last visit here, and he is interesting now upped in trip. Not That Fuisse is another worth a place on the shortlist.\n\n\n\nRace 5 - 2.30 Albert Bartlett Novices' Hurdle (Grade 2)\n\nIt could pay to side with THE MULCAIR for the Skelton's.\n\nA winning pointer, he created a very positive impressive when thumping a good horse on his Rules bow.\n\nRedford Road was second to the classy Valtor at Ascot last time, but the former is open to further progress at the age of five, particularly over this trip.\n\nMossy Fen is 2-2 under Rules and is the pick of Sam Twiston-Davies. He should also relish the step back up to three-miles.\n\n\n\nRace 6 - 3.05 Unibet International Hurdle (Grade 2)\n\nNot the strongest renewal of this race, and all eyes will be on Triumph Hurdle hero Pentland Hills.\n\nThe Champion Hurdle division needs a shot in the arm and he could well provide it - but it can often prove tricky for four-year-old's in their second season over hurdles and he is short enough.\n\nPreference is for CALL ME LORD, who cruised through the Coral Hurdle at Ascot on his return and looked all over the winner for much of the race.\n\nBut he got tired close home and was eventually passed by thorough stayer If The Cap Fits with the pair pulling clear. He will appreciate the drop back to 2m.\n\nCh'Tibello has been a good servant to connections and won the County Hurdle in fine style at the Festival in March. He holds rock-solid claims.\n\nElixir De Nutz would probably have preferred slightly slower ground, but he is a fascinating contender on his first run since an easy Tolworth Hurdle win in January.\n\n\n\nRace 7 - 3.40 Park Mares' Handicap Hurdle\n\nA wide-open finale but the nod goes to MISTY BLOOM.\n\nShe was a decisive winner of a similarly competitive mares' event at Wincanton last time and her yard are enjoying a fantastic winter.\n\nIf an 11lb hike halts her in her tracks, the progressive Queens Cave could be best-placed to take advantage.\n\nIndefatigable, Dame De Compagnie and northern raider Mega Yeats are also closely considered.\n\n\n\nThe Sun Racing team preview the action at Cheltenham and Doncaster this weekend\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [47, 60], "id":

Bulgarian government has allocated an additional BGN 20 M to three southeastern regions where a fence is being built along the border with Turkey.\n\nThe fence, which is referred to as a \"temporary deterring installation,\" is aimed at \"withstanding the migratory pressure on the Bulgarian-Turkish border growing over the past years\" and at \"stemming the wave of refugees,\" according to a government press statement.\n\nFor more than two years since 2014, when construction began, the costs have surpassed BGN 100 M as of this summer.\n\nSeparately, the cabinet has disbursed BGN 0.407 M to repair border crossings and border police stations and equipment as part of \"urgent measures relating to the accession of [Bulgaria] into the Schengen area.\"\n\nAs an upward migratory pressure on the southeastern border has been reported over the past few years, two successive Bulgarian governments have pledged to reduce the inflow of migrants through the fence, but even with much of the construction being finished, data shows the number of arrivals has not been strongly affected.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 8], "id": "Q219", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by":

Energy explorer Apache Corp. might follow suit off Kenya's coast in 2012, he added.\n\nTullow Oil announced in May that it signed a memorandum of understanding with Uganda that lets it move forward with energy development in the country. Kenya, however, doesn't have proven reserves and the number of exploratory wells drilled in the country pales in comparison with its neighbors.\n\nDragan Trajkov, an energy analyst at London's Renaissance Capital, told Bloomberg News that Tullow moving into Kenya could trigger more interest in the country's energy sector.\n\nHeya added that now was the time to work on the country's fledgling energy sector before constitutional regulations become law.\n\n\"The level of activity is at a high and we think once Tullow starts drilling we must prepare ourselves for even more interest,\" he was quoted as saying. \"The more wells that are drilled, the faster a discovery will be made.\"\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [0, 5], "id": "Q114", "recognized_by": "ReFinED",

{"id": 20173013400, "title": "20170831 - Can I buy insurance to protect my investments beyond the \u00a350k limit?", "text": "Can I buy insurance to protect my investments beyond the \u00a350k limit?\n\nBy Marc Shoffman for MailOnline\n\n\nI want to make sure my investments are protected and I know that \u00a350,000 of money invested with each investing platform or fund house is covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. But how can I protect amounts above this limit?\n\nMark Polson, of platform research business the lang cat, replies: Investments are 'insured\" or protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.\n\nThe exact arrangements are complex, but broadly speaking the first \u00a385,000 of any cash deposits in a savings account with a bank or building society are covered if it goes bust.\n\nYou only receive this \u00a385,000 coverage once under each bank or building society's 'compensation licence', it is doubled to \u00a3170,000 for joint accounts. You can ask for information on how you are covered by the FSCS from your bank and get a full explanation of savings compensation here.\n\nUnder a separate part of the scheme you also get compensation cover for the first \u00a350,000 of any investments. Remember this is not cover against you losing money if investments go down, ie your fund dips in value, it covers you against losses if the investment provider or platform goes bust.\n\nThis covers the companies who are holding investments on your behalf; it doesn't mean that if a firm you buy shares in goes bust you get your money back.\n\nI've looked but can find no-one willing to offer this kind of insurance. In its absence and if you are concerned then you may wish to consider spreading investments around and holding no more than \u00a350,000 with any one fund house or custodian.\n\nMost fund houses and platforms will appoint another company known as a custodian to look after your money.\n\nAnd that is important - a bit like different banking brands, sometimes behind the scenes different investment brands use the same custodian to hold your investments.\n\nBroadly speaking, if your investment platform or provider gets into difficulties, you may face delays and frustration, but your money should be safe as it is held separate from the assets of the company itself.\n\nA custodian provides this service; these are normally very large, highly regulated and financially stable organisations such as Bank of New York Mellon, Citibank and Deutsche Bank.\n\nFor your money to disappear, it is the custodian who would need to fail rather than the business through which you transact investments.\n\nSo if the fund house, platform or custodian goes bust, you are covered by FSCS up to \u00a350,000.\n\nSo in that situation, let's say you are with Platform Z, which uses custodian X, and you've asked them to buy Fund Y from Fund Manager W.\n\nIf Fund Manager W goes bust you have FSCS cover to \u00a350,000. Same for the custodian and for the platform. What you do not have is protection against Fund Y falling in value.\n", "entity_mentions": [{"span": [73, 86], "id": "<NIL>", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": []}, {"span": [91, 101], "id": "Q6735687", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q6735687"]}, {"span": [256, 294], "id": "Q1416205", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1416205"]}, {"span": [345, 356], "id": "<NIL>", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": []}, {"span": [392, 400], "id": "<NIL>", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": []}, {"span": [457, 495], "id": "Q1416205", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1416205"]}, {"span": [887, 891], "id": "Q1416205", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1416205"]}, {"span": [2273, 2296], "id": "Q589288", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q589288"]}, {"span": [2298, 2306], "id": "Q857063", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1093349", "Q16964442", "Q2007692", "Q2151111", "Q4421076", "Q5122439", "Q5122443", "Q5122450", "Q5122451", "Q591866", "Q857063"]}, {"span": [2311, 2324], "id": "Q66048", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q15109284", "Q23035319", "Q324434", "Q66048"]}, {"span": [2539, 2543], "id": "Q1416205", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1416205"]}, {"span": [2605, 2615], "id": "<NIL>", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": []}, {"span": [2670, 2676], "id": "<NIL>", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": []}, {"span": [2682, 2696], "id": "<NIL>", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": []}, {"span": [2702, 2716], "id": "<NIL>", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": []}, {"span": [2736, 2740], "id": "Q1416205", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": ["Q1416205"]}, {"span": [2847, 2853], "id": "<NIL>", "recognized_by": "ReFinED", "linked_by": "ReFinED", "candidates": []}], "evaluation_span": [2327, 2697], "labels": [{"id": 0, "span": [2539, 2543], "entity_id": "Q1416205", "name": "Financial Services Compensation Scheme", "type": "Q43229", "coref": false}, {"id": 1, "span": [2551, 2557], "entity_id": "QUANTITY", "name": "Unknown", "type": "QUANTITY", "coref": false}, {"id": 2, "span": [2682, 2694], "entity_id": "Q1435728", "name": "fund manager", "type": "Q12737077|Q4164871", "coref": false}]}
