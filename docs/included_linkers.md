# List of Included Linkers
ELEVANT comes with a number of entity linkers that can be used out of the box or have to be trained first.
This document gives an overview of these entity linkers and how they can be used.

#### TagMe
TagMe was introduced by Ferragina & Scaiella in the 2010 paper [TAGME: On-the-fly Annotation of Short Text Fragments
 (by Wikipedia Entities)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1871437.1871689). TagMe particularly aims at linking
 entities in very short texts like tweets or snippets of search engine results. The code is available on [Github
 ](https://github.com/marcocor/tagme-python).
 
In ELEVANT, you can use the TagMe linker for example with the `link_benchmark_entities.py` script by providing the
 linker name `tagme` and the score threshold. The threshold is a value between 0 and 1. Predicted entities with a score
 lower than the threshold will be discarded.
 
    python3 link_benchmark_entities.py <experiment_name> tagme 0.2 -b <benchmark_name>

The TagMe linker class is implemented [here](../src/linkers/tagme_linker.py) and uses the TagMe API. TagMe predicts
 Wikipedia entity links. We map the predicted Wikipedia entities to Wikidata using our mappings.

#### Baseline
ELEVANT comes with a simple baseline that performs Entity Recognition using the SpaCy NER component and that links
 entities based on prior probabilities for recognized mention texts. These prior probabilities are computed using
 Wikipedia hyperlinks. The prior probability for an entity *e* given a mention text *m* is computed as the number of
 times the text *m* was linked to *e* in our Wikipedia training split) over the number of times the text *m* was
 linked to any entity in our Wikipedia training split.
 
You can use the Baseline by providing the linker name `baseline` and the additional specification `links-all` to the
 linking script:
 
    python3 link_benchmark_entities.py <experiment_name> baseline links-all -b <benchmark_name>

The Baseline linker class is implemented [here](../src/linkers/alias_entity_linker.py).

#### POS Prior
This linker is similar to the baseline linker described above. The main difference is, that instead of using the
 SpaCy NER component, a set of simple rules based on POS tags are used for entity recognition.
 
You can use the POS Prior linker by providing the linker name `pos_prior` and a file with whitelist types. Only
 entities with a type from the whitelist are linked.

    python3 link_benchmark_entities.py <experiment_name> pos_prior data/whitelist_types.txt -b <benchmark_name>

The POS Prior linker class is implemented [here](../src/linkers/prior_linker.py).


#### SpaCy

The SpaCy linker does not work out of the box and needs to be trained first.
This requires the following steps:

1. Generate word vectors:

       python3 create_entity_word_vectors.py 0

2. Create the Wikipedia knowledge base:

       python3 create_knowledge_base_wikipedia.py

3. Train the entity linker:

       python3 train_spacy_entity_linker.py <linker_name> <n_batches> wikipedia
       
The SpaCy linker can then be used with the created wikipedia knowledge base by providing the linker name `spacy` and
 the knowledge base name `wikipedia` to the linking script:
 
    python3 link_benchmark_entities.py <experiment_name> spacy wikipedia -b <benchmark_name>
